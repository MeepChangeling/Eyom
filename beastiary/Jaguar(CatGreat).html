<p>The jaguar is a highly aggressive and ferocious great cat that makes its home in dense forests or swampy areas near a source of fresh water. Of all the big cats, the jaguar is the most at home in the water. They are excellent swimmers and stalk their prey through deep water where other cats wonât go. They also excel at climbing and often spend time hunting tree-dwelling animals (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/primates/primate-monkey">monkeys</a>). The jaguar is highly territorial with its personal hunting ground often covering an area of several square miles. The typical jaguar subsists on a diet of animals such as deer, tapir, <a class="disabled" href="20d4330398127c82">elk</a>, fish, armadillos, and other small animals. If hungry or its food supply is thin, jaguars have been known to attack prey much larger than itself. (Creatures as large as warhorses are known to have fallen victim to the powerful jaws of the jaguar.) The jaguar has no rival among the other big <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cat/cat">cats</a>.</p>
<p>Jaguars are solitary creatures, but occasionally a lair is discovered that contains a female and 1d4 cubs. Cubs are often captured and sold on the market where they can be trained and raised. Jaguars are sometimes confused with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/felines/cat-great/leopard">leopards</a>. Both <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/felines/cat">cats</a> have a brownish-yellow base fur with dark spots or markings. The jaguar can be distinguished by the smaller markings inside the spots. A jaguarâs forelimbs and head are slightly larger than the average <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cat/leopard">leopard</a> (another distinguishing characteristic). Black jaguars are often called black panthers (a misnomer applied to black <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/felines/cat-great/leopard">leopards</a> sometimes as well).</p>

<h4><span id="Animate_Trees_Sp">Animate Trees (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A treant can animate any trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the treant’s animation and rock-throwing abilities), gaining the treant’s vulnerability to fire. If the treant that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.<br/> </p>
<h4><span id="Double_Damage_Against_Objects_Ex">Double Damage Against Objects (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.<br/> </p>

<p>A treant has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-plants">speak with plants</a></i> spell, and most plants greet them with an attitude of friendly or helpful.<br/> </p>

<p>Treants are guardians of the forest and speakers for the trees. As long-lived as the forests themselves, and seeing themselves as parents and shepherds rather than gardeners, treants are slow and methodical in most things but terrifying when forced to fight in defense of their flock. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of the short-lived races, and have an inherent distrust of change, they have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long, rambling monologues, especially if the pupils express a desire to help protect the wildlands. Yet against those who would threaten the forest, especially loggers who seek to harvest wood for lumber or those who try to clearcut a section of forest in order to build a fort or establish a town, the treants’ wrath is swift and devastating. They are particularly gifted at tearing down what others buildâa trait that serves angry treants well.</p>

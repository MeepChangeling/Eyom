<p>Dragonfish are not aggressive and prefer to lie on the bottom of a body of water, waiting for a victim to step on it so its poisonous spines penetrate the victimâs flesh. If forced into melee, a dragonfish attacks with its bite.</p>

Melee weapons do not endanger a user in this way. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a dragonfish. A creature that takes more than 2 points of damage from a dragonfishâs barb has its speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts until the barb is removed.</p>

<p>A dragonfish is a small, 2-foot long, flat fish that makes its home on the bottom of shallow lakes, rivers, or streams. The dragonfishâs back is covered with long, sharp spines. A dragonfishâs dorsal spines carry a virulent poison that is delivered whenever an opponent contacts a spine. They are non-aggressive and spend their days eating miniscule water creatures, insects, and aquatic plants.</p>

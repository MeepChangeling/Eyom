<h4><span id="Absorb_Ex">Absorb (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An etheric jelly feeds by absorbing other etheric jellies. The etheric jelly makes a melee <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> against the target jelly. If successful, the target jelly is consumed, and the attacking jelly gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/advanced-creature-cr-1">advanced</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/simple-template-giant-cr-1">giant creature</a> simple templates. This ability works on other etheric jellies only.</p>
<h4><span id="Evaporating_Touch_Su">Evaporating Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An etheric jellyâs otherworldly touch dissolves living matter, leaving festering wounds and causing 4d6 points of damage plus 1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a>. A DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> and halves the damage. Any creature slain by this ability evaporates completely, as if affected by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disintegrate">disintegrate</a>. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">Undead</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, and other non-living materials such as clothing or other normal gear are immune to this ability. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Reactive_Jaunt_Ex">Reactive Jaunt (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When an etheric jelly on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane">Ethereal Plane</a> is detected by a creature on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> (for example, by a creature using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/see-invisibility">see invisibility</a>), the etheric jelly immediately shifts to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. Nonmagical abilities such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> and abilities which cannot detect ethereal creatures do not trigger this ability. The etheric jelly remains on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> permanently, barring <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dismissal">dismissal</a> or similar magic. This ability is otherwise identical to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/ethereal-jaunt">ethereal jaunt</a> (CL 12th).</p>
<h4><span id="Split_Ex">Split (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Magical slashing weapons deal no damage to an etheric jelly. Instead, the creature splits into two identical etheric jellies, each with half of the original creatureâs current hit point total, rounded down. An etheric jelly with 10 or fewer <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> cannot be further <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Split-Ex-">split</a> and dies if reduced to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Transparent_Ex">Transparent (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Due to its lack of coloration, an etheric jelly is difficult to discern from its surroundings. A DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check is required to notice the etheric jelly. Any creature that fails to notice an etheric jelly and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the jellyâs slam attack.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (ethereal plane or material plane)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, group (3â6), or clot (4â16)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>In most locations on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, there is a base 5% chance of an etheric jelly appearing within range of a given <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/see-invisibility">see invisibility</a> spell. Such jellies approach the emanating effect, attacking the source creature. Whether they attack out of hostility or as an unrecognizably alien attempt at communication is unknown.</p>
<p>An etheric jelly appears as a semitransparent, undulating ball of protoplasm about two feet in diameter. They are cannibalistic in nature, consuming others of their kind by absorption with no real maximum size. Larger specimens have been recorded, and much larger variants have been postulated but not confirmed by any survivors of such an encounter. In theory, the only limit to the growth of a single etheric jelly is time and the availability of other jellies as food.</p>

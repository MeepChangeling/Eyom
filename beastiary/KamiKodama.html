<p>In cases where a tree is particularly ancient or immense, however, the kodama associated with it is much largerâstatistics for such rare kodama can be generated by advancing the kodama given here by several <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> and increasing its sizeâtheoretically, a Colossal kodama with more than 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> could exist somewhere in the world. Not all kodama increase in power by gaining racial <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>, though, as some instead progress by gaining class levels, particularly levels of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid</a>, though a rare few kodama kamiâthose possessed of minds more ordered and structured than is normal for their raceâtake the path of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monk</a>. </p>

<p>Revered by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druids</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">rangers</a> for their attunement with the wilds, kodama, known also as tree kami, are the guardians of the wild trees of the forestâthey do not protect trees cultivated and grown in civilized areas. (Those trees are protected by different kami, if at all.) A kodama takes a single tree under its protection; typically, all of the trees in a forest that are protected by kodama are clustered together in one particular area. A kodama in its physical form resembles a barely humanoid creature with only the vaguest of features on its semispherical head. A tree kami is 3 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds. While one might expect the kami of something as large as a tree to itself be larger, the fact that forests are made up of so many trees tends to diminish the singular “presence” any single tree might have.</p>
<p>Kodama are more curious about visitors than most kami, and often manifest their physical bodies simply to watch and observe newcomers to their groves. A kodama usually manifests on the far side of its tree, or in the shadows of the undergrowth, so that it can slowly step out into visibility to quietly observe with its distracting, empty-eyed gaze. This gaze can be particularly unnerving. Those who have fallen under its supernatural effects often have different descriptions of how the gaze made them feel (ashamed, frightened, curious, amused, and nervous being the most common reactions), yet the end result is essentially the same. While under observation by a curious kodama, few are those who can continue their actions without being at least somewhat distracted by the kami’s attention.</p>
<p>When a kodama must fight (typically in order to defend its tree or other kami), it moves quicklyâkodama work best in groups, and when confronted alone generally use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tree-stride">tree stride</a> to travel to another part of the forest to raise a small host of allies to aid it in defending its home.</p>

<h1>Megafauna, Zeuglodon</h1>
<p class="description">This elongated, whale-like creature moves through the water with an eel-like motion despite its wide, fluked tail. Razor-sharp teeth fill its almost reptilian mouth.</p>

<h4><span id="Hold_Breath_Ex"><a name="TOC-Hold-Breath-Ex-"></a>Hold Breath (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A zeuglodon can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> score before it risks drowning.</p>
<h4><span id="Thrash_Ex"><a name="TOC-Thrash-Ex-"></a>Thrash (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A zeuglodon <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> a foe can thrash its body back and forth rapidly, dealing extra damage due to the violent motion of its whipping head. This attack deals 4d8+19 points of damage, but allows the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> creature a free attempt to escape the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>. If a creature escapes, it is thrown 30 feet in a random direction by the zeuglodon’s erratic thrashing.</p>
<p> Primeval Sea Creatures 
<p>The ocean is full of myriad life forms, as varied and specialized as those in any other environment. But not all sea creatures are the result of millennia upon millennia of continual evolution. Some found themselves perfectly suited for their roles as apex predators millions of years ago and have simply remained as such to the present day, presenting terrible threats to those creatures that cross them, from their natural prey to unsuspecting sailors who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. In most cases, these creatures are closely related to other waterborne animals, be they fish, reptiles, or mammals, and some even have distinctive similarities to primarily land-based creatures.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm oceans<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>The primordial zeuglodon is often mistaken for a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/dinosaur">dinosaur</a> or other large reptile, in part because of its almost crocodilian mouth as well as its snake-like elongation. Despite these features, it is more closely related to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/whale">whales</a> and other cetaceans than either <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> reptiles or fish. A zeuglodon moves through the water with a vertical anguiliform (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/eel">eel</a>-like) motion that seems almost to be a primitive version of the efficient fluke-driven locomotion of its cetacean relatives. Zeuglodons breathe air through blowholes on the tops of their heads, though they lack the lung capacity to stay underwater for as long as their more evolved kin. The relative dimensions of their angular heads are too small to encase the enlarged brains or melons developed by other cetaceans for echolocation or communication with others of their kind, and as such zeuglodons are less social than <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/whale">whales</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/dolphin">dolphins</a>. What they lack in specialized anatomy, however, they make up for in sheer ferocity and speed.</p>
<p>A hunting zeuglodon is a furious foe to contend with.</p>
<p>An adult zeuglodon measures around 50 feet long and weighs upward of 50,000 pounds.</p>

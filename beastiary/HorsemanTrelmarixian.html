<h4><span id="Predecessors_Rage_Su">Predecessorâs Rage (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Trelmarixian consumed the previous Horseman of Famine, and portions of that previous Horsemanâs essence still exist within Trelmarixianâs belly, being slowly digested like a sweet, spiritual lozenge. This previous Horseman was herself a parasitic entity, and once per hour as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>, Trelmarixian can lower his resistance to his predecessorâs rage to allow her to infuse him with fury from within. When Trelmarixian does so, he gains the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/righteous-might">righteous might</a>, and his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> increases to 30 for 4 rounds. When this effect ends, Trelmarixian is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1d4+1 rounds if he fails a DC 35 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save, or for only 1 round if he succeeds.</p>
<h4><span id="Ravenous_Devourer_Ex">Ravenous Devourer (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Trelmarixianâs bite attacks always apply 1-1/2 Ã his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier to his damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Swallow_Whole_Su">Swallow Whole (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Trelmarixianâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-">swallow whole</a> ability is a supernatural ability that can affect Huge or smaller creatures, despite the fact that Trelmarixian is only Medium.</p>
<p>His stomach functions similarly to an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> space and can hold any number of creatures. If Trelmarixian swallows an object that contains an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> space (such as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-holding">bag of holding</a> or a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/portable-hole">portable hole</a>), that object cannot be opened while it is within the Horseman of Famineâs belly, but it does not otherwise interact with his stomach in a destructive way.</p>
<h4><span id="Wail_of_the_Consumed_Su">Wail of the Consumed (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Trelmarixian can, as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> once every 1d4 rounds, call upon the tattered fragments of the innumerable souls he has consumed to unleash a mind-shattering wail. This affects all creatures within a 60-foot spread. Affected creatures take 1d10 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Wisdom drain</a> and are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at a DC 36 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save instead takes 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> and is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round. This is a sonic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or mounted (Trelmarixian and the Black Horse)<br/><b>Treasure</b> triple</p>
<p>The youngest but perhaps most ambitious of the Four, Trelmarixian the Black obsesses over soul consumption, riding the line between brutal, amoral science and quasi-religious zealotry. A perpetually ravenous shapeshifting horror, Trelmarixian maintains a three-headed humanoid shapeâbut only just, with his frame constantly shuddering and shifting and threatening to slump into a protoplasmic slurry of bile, blood, and mucus. Trelmarixian was once a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/meladaemon">meladaemon</a> himself, and his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/meladaemon">meladaemon</a> servitors, while always emaciated and bestial, have become more canine in appearance under his rule. When the so-called Lysogenic Prince rose to power, he overthrew and consumed his predecessor, but he maintains a fragment of her existence within him to fuel periodic bouts of parasitic rage.</p>
<p>Trelmarixian embodies not only starvation, but also the broader concept of wasting, both physical and metaphysical, particularly the lingering dooms of cancer, parasitism, and spiritual decay. Like the viral afflictions he represents, the Horseman of Famine behaves like his chosen concept in a concrete manner, having secretively inserted fragments of his physical form into many of his servitors. This bombards him with sensory information on a truly maddening scale, and thus Trelmarixianâs fragmented mind brims with insanity and a multitude of voices, including that of his predecessor. He still adores her in his own fashion, and she in turn speaks to him, advising as she sees fit or mocking his shortcomings like an aggressive, self-aware conscience. By force of will, he can silence the voices, but the thing that haunts him more than any of these cannot be so easily dismissed.</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> retain only fractured, fragmented recollections of their mortal life. Trelmarixian, on the other hand, remembers everything save for the last few minutes of his life. As a mortal, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Daemon">daemon</a>-blooded tiefling, Trelmarixian exterminated all life on his world with a work of profound sorcery, but in doing so he condemned himself to starvation.</p>
<p>Near the moment of his agonizing death, he recalls someone talking to him, asking him questions and mocking his success as paltry compared to what awaited him after death. Despite his destruction of everyone he had ever known in life, someone was there, and he cannot remember that personâs face or final words.</p>
<p>Trelmarixianâs memories haunt him still, as does the question of whose blood his soul carried, and thus who may still have some unknown claim on him, such as a long-dead Horseman of Famine. Heâs likewise haunted by the notion that he was born to be the vector for his progenitorâs returnâone virus within another, waiting and incubating, to someday express itself and snuff him out as he did his own predecessor.</p>
<p>Trelmarixianâs domain, the Withered Court, is a realm of biological and metaphysical horrors, towers spun from flesh and bone with mortal souls used like living, screaming bricks, each mournfully crying out in the constant pangs of starvation. In this realm of horrors, his servitors devour as much as they craft, warping souls into nightmarish wonders while their master continues his nihilistic work within his citadel, the miles-high Weeping Tower.</p>
<h3><span id="Trelmarixians_Cult">Trelmarixianâs Cult</span></h3>
<p>Trelmarixian is worshiped by all those touched by famine and the broader concept of wasting, including evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druids</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/gryph">gryphs</a>, hungry ghosts, and victims of starvation.</p>
<p>Trelmarixian also holds the allegiance of many of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Daemon">daemon</a>-worshiping and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Daemon">daemon</a>-created <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/Urdefhan">urdefhan</a> race.</p>
<p>The Lysogenic Prince is further served by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/astradaemon">astradaemons</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/derghodaemon">derghodaemons</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/fiendish">fiendish</a> jackals and jackal monsters, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghouls</a>, scavengers, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire/vampire">vampires</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin">vermin</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/wendigo">wendigos</a>, but also by those who have been driven to madness or cannibalism by starvation.</p>
<p>Trelmarixianâs unholy symbol is a jackal skull viewed from the side as it clutches a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel/solar">solar</a> eclipse in its jaws, and the spiked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/gauntlet">gauntlet</a> is his favored weapon.

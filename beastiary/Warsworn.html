<h1>Warsworn</h1>
<p class="description">An enormous animate mass comprised of dozens of armed and armored corpses undulates forth, like a living siege tower of steel-girded flesh. Where this mangled army of broken blades and rent flesh passes, the ground is torn and soaked in blood.</p>

<p>A warsworn can consume any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a> creature by moving into the same space. This immediately kills the creature, absorbs the corpse into the warsworn, and heals the warsworn by an amount equal to the creature’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> score.

<h4><a name="TOC-Scrap-Ball-Ex-"></a>Scrap Ball (Ex)</h4>
<p>The warsworn can throw a mass of broken weapons and armor. This deals an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + the warsworn’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier, and has a range increment of 20 feet.</p>

<p>A single warsworn, composed of innumerable fallen humanoids, pieces of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, and weapons, typically weighs several tons and can reach a height of up to 25 feet.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</h4>
<p>As undead creatures, warsworns have no bodily needs, such as for food or water, and they exist solely to destroy and cause chaos. Unknown to many, however, is the fact that warsworns often begin undeath at a much smaller size than is usually seen. Initially only as big as a common wagon, the unimpressive mounds shift across the warstained field from which they were born, rolling onto the scattered corpses and debris, consuming the sordid scene in a matter of hours, at which point they often reach their formidable, ordinarily seen size. Therefore, it is not uncommon for holy warriors, upon hearing news of a battle-stricken land allegedly infested by a warsworn, to rush to the site in the hope of overcoming the monster before it has time to reach its full potential.</p>
<p>However, warsworns are frighteningly quick to grow, and most come to a kind of monstrous, unliving maturity before being destroyed. Once the battleground has been scraped clean of its dead, warsworns, never satiated, take to the surrounding area, searching hungrily for more dead to consume, and often invading small towns or villages to create the corpses themselves. They take ironic pleasure in destroying military settlements, bringing the wars of yesteryear roaring back to the unsuspecting peopleâa brutal, animate reminder that the dead never forget. Although warsworns have little concern for what or whom they destroy, they seem to favor consuming soldiers, victims of war, or at the very least those who die with blade and shield in handâas if not just seeking new bodies to add to its monstrous girth, but also desirous of some remnant of rage or battle lust.</p>
<p>Thus, while a warsworn will roll relentlessly onward and devastate with complete disregard, the unsatisfied monster is constantly searching for war-stricken lands, sites of conflict both ancient and fresh, so that it may satisfy its hunger with the broken steel and festering disease of the battlefield.</p>
<h3>Habitat &amp; Society</h3>
<p>Warsworns can be found near areas that have seen great strife or war, especially battlefields, and sometimes make their way toward settlements close to such sites of human destruction. Warsworns, while intelligent, have little need for alliances, as their incredible size and strength provides all the muscle they require to wreak as much havoc as possible. Despite appearing as little more than a tide of zombies, these undead are driven on by more than mindless rage, retaining some communal memory of a soldierâs tactics and a brawlerâs instincts.</p>
<p>Proving to be surprisingly canny in battle, warsworns make use of every element of their necrotic bodies, including the splintered metal and rusting plates within their forms. The abominations have been known to launch great masses of rusting metal and shattered bone from their innermost hallows, balls of scrap propelled forth as if from a gigantic hellish catapult. Many of the creaturesâ grasping limbs also bear the remains of weapons, but such armaments rarely survive the undead thingâs constant grinding motion, which reduces them to little more than lengths of dull metal amid the warswornâs thrashing, body-sized limbs. Unsleeping and unrelenting, warsworns are almost always on the move. Thus, warsworns might stop their rampage or even retreat for strategic means, waiting until nightfall to strike the people of a settlement near the site of a battleâthe warswornsâ most infamous and commonly utilized tactic. Farming communities located near vast stretches of fields that were once the site of a skirmish are often victim to warswornsâ sudden, unpredictable attacks.</p>

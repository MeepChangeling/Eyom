<h1>Lurker in Light</h1>
<p class="description">This small humanoid lurks at the edge of illumination, its fine features bleeding away at the edges, making it appear blurred and out of focus. Moving into the light, it vanishes, but its invisible presence is tangible as a feeling of being watched.</p>

<h4><span id="Blend_with_Light_Su"><a name="TOC-Blend-with-Light-Su-"></a><b>Blend with Light (Su)</b></span></h4>
<p> In areas of bright light, lurkers are invisible. As with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility"><i>greater invisibility</i></a>, they may attack and still remain invisible. In shadowy illumination, a lurker loses this <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility"><i>invisibility</i></a>, though like all creatures in shadows, they have <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> unless the viewer has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision">darkvision</a>. If the lurker is flying, its fluttering wings partially negate this effect, giving it only partial concealment (20%) rather than total concealment.</p>
<h4><span id="Daylight_Door_Sp"><a name="TOC-Daylight-Door-Sp-"></a><b>Daylight Door (Sp)</b></span></h4>
<p> Once per day, a lurker can use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door"><i>dimension door</i></a>, transporting only itself and up to 50 pounds of material. The start and end points of the teleport must be in areas of bright light; if the destination lacks sufficient light, the teleport fails but does not expend the ability for the day.</p>
<h4><span id="Poison_Ex"><a name="TOC-Poison-Ex-"></a><b>Poison (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p> Lurkers typically coat their daggers with shadow essence poison. </p>
<p style="margin-left:40px"><b>Shadow essence poison</b>: Injury; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> DC 17; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>initial effect</i> 1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Str</a> drain; <i>secondary effect</i> 1d3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Str</a> damage; <i>cure</i> 1 save.</p>
<h4><span id="Ritual_Gate_Su"><a name="TOC-Ritual-Gate-Su-"></a><b>Ritual Gate (Su)</b></span></h4>
<p> By sacrificing one or more humanoid victims, a lurker or group of lurkers can create a gate to the Material Plane, one of the Elemental Planes, or the realm of the fey, either to return home or to conjure allies. Creating a gate for travel requires the sacrifice of five victimsâthe gate created remains open for 1 minute. Creating a gate to bring allies to the Material Plane requires one sacrifice for every <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">HD</a> of the creature intended to pass through the gate (so five sacrifices can bring a lurker or a Medium air elemental, eight can bring a Large earth elemental, and so on). The sacrifices do not need to be simultaneous; as long all sacrifices occur at some point during the hour-long ritual, the magic continues to build until it reaches the required total.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land (extraplanar)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or gang (3â8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (dagger, other treasure)</p>
<p>Malicious and alien fey, lurkers in light venture to the Material Plane to perpetrate strangely targeted mischief, stealing and killing according to a logic or system of justice only they understand. Gnomes in particular seem to incur these unexplained attacks, leading some to believe that lurkers may be agents of ancient and vengeful forces. Creatures of the light, lurkers are visible only in dim illumination, with anything brighter than a flickering torch making them completely invisible, even as they savage their enemiesâa prospect terrifying to those civilized races that equate light with safety.</p>
<p>A lurker in light turns conventional wisdom on its head, for they detest darkness and the creatures that dwell in it, yet they themselves are sadistic and evil. They particularly hate darkmantles, dwarves, and creatures from the Plane of Shadow, and given the time, they enjoy torturing such creatures to death if they can capture them alive.</p>
<p>If killed, a lurker in light disintegrates over the course of several minutes into 2d6 pounds of dust that radiates faint <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Evocation">evocation</a> magic and glows for 1d6 days with a cold light equal to that provided by a candle. This dust damages shadows as if it were holy water, with a pound of dust equal to one flask of holy water.</p>
<p>A lurker in light is 3 feet tall, but weighs only 20 pounds.</p>

<h4>Sudden Charge (Ex)</h4>
<p>When making a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a> attack, an axe beak makes a single bite attack. If successful, it may also attempt to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip">trip</a> its opponent as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> without provoking an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. If the attempt fails, the axe beak cannot be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip">tripped</a> in return.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate plains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or flock (3-6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Keen-witted and powerful avian predators, axe beaks compete with <a href="wolf">wolves</a> and hunting cats for prey upon vast, open steppes and prairies. Although feared for their boldness and territorial natures, these giant birds prove eminently tamable, making useful guardians, hunters, and even steeds when kept well fed. Axe beaks are relatively social creatures, forming small groups in which both males and females hunt together. They nest in immense mounds made of sticks, branches, leaves, and whatever else they can scavenge (including the bones and equipment of previous meals), with each nest used by a large group of axe beaks. Females typically lay clutches of 1d4+1 eggs once per year, which the parents take turns keeping warm for 2 months before they hatch. Mature axe beaks stand 9 feet tall and weigh as much as 500 pounds. Their plumage varies widely, from gray to brown to black in temperate climes, but taking on exotic shades of gold, red, blue, and other vibrant hues in more tropical environs. Axe beaks have lifespans of up to 50 years.</p>
<p>An axe beak requires training before it will bear a rider. Taming an axe beak requires 6 weeks of work and a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> check, after which it can be taught tricks as normal. Riding an axe beak requires an exotic saddle. Axe beak eggs are worth 1,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 1,500 gp each. A light load for an axe beak is up to 200 pounds; a medium load, 201-400 pounds; and a heavy load, 401-600 pounds.</p>
<p>Other types of large, predatory flightless birds exist such as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/birds/axe-beak/diatryma">diatryma</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/birds/axe-beak/axe-beak-terror-bird">terror bird</a> but the axe beak is but the most commonly encountered and well known of this breed of predator.</p>

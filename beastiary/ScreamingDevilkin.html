<p>Shrill wails echoing through the night signal the arrival of a screaming devilkin. Screaming devilkins are smallish beasts, humanoid in appearance but with frail and spindly arms and legs. These weak limbs are nearly useless for combat and locomotion, but the screaming devilkin makes up for this disability with its bat-like wings. Although screaming devilkins are fast fliers, they are not particularly agile on the wing. Screaming devilkins also have a long, muscular, barbed tail that is their primary means of physical attack. It should be noted that despite its appearance and name, the screaming devilkin has no connection with outsiders of any type.</p>
<p>A screaming devilkin is a tireless combatant, refusing to back down regardless of how the combat is progressing; it always attacks on sight. It attacks in melee by stabbing with its barbed tail (inflicting piercing damage) and screams continuously until it or its opponent is dead.</p>
<p>A typical screaming devilkin is 3 feet tall and has a wingspan of about 5 feet. Its skin is reddish-brown in color and its eyes are black. Its tail is about 2-1/2 feet long.</p>

<h4><span id="Best_Served_Cold_Su">Best Served Cold (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Each time a despicable snowman hits a foe with its slam attack, a target who fails a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw feels a rush of cold course through its veins dealing an additional 2d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage">nonlethal damage</a>. Furthermore, the creature hit is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> until the end of its next turn. Although the effect does not deal cold damage, creatures with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resistance">resistance</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to cold damage, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> are unaffected by this ability. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Freeze_Ex">Freeze (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A despicable snowman can hold itself so still that it appears to be an inanimate snowman. A despicable snowman who uses <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Freeze-Ex-">freeze</a> can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Take-20">take 20</a> on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> check to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo---rogue-advanced-talents/hide-in-plain-sight-ex">hide in plain sight</a> as a snowman in snowy or icy terrain.</p>
<h4><span id="Icy_Gaze_Su">Icy Gaze (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Creatures within 30 feet who meet the eyes of a despicable snowman take 5d6 points of cold damage (DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save half damage). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. If the target fails its save, it becomes frozen solid, leaving it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a>. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full round action that does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>. If this save is successful, the effect ends.</p>
<p>If not, the subject takes 3d6 points of cold damage and remains frozen. When a target successfully saves or the effect ends, the subject cannot be affected by the frozen <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> of that despicable snowman for 1 day.</p>
<h4><span id="Melt_Ex">Melt (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A despicable snowman exposed to an air temperature greater than the freezing point of water (32Â° Fahrenheit, 0Â° Celsius) at the beginning of its turn must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage">nonlethal damage</a> and be affected as if by a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> spell until the beginning of its next turn.</p>
<p>Instantaneous effects evoking fire or generating heat do not deal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage">nonlethal damage</a> to the despicable snowman nor <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> it.</p>
<h4><span id="Snow_Glide_Ex">Snow Glide (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A despicable snowman can move across ice and snow without penalty and does not need to make <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks to run or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a> on ice.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any cold<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>A fur hat, two black buttons, a dark twig, and a bloodred scarf adorn the head of a ghastly creature made up of three spheres of ice and snow. The largest sphere rests on the bottom, while the smallest sphere sits on top. The objects are arranged onto the smallest sphere to resemble a humanoid face.</p>
<p>No one greets fresh snow with more enthusiasm than children. When the seasonâs first snowflakes fall from the heavens, youngsters happily greet the wondrous droplets of frozen water like a long-lost friend. Boys and girls in many polar communities use snow and ice as artistic mediums, creating breathtaking ice sculptures and forts from the frigid material. However, building a snowman remains the most common form of artistic expression. Regional differences aside, snowmen feature a wide, spherical base, a central abdomen, and a smaller, round head decorated with articles of clothing to create the likeness of a human face. Many don scarves, hats, and gloves, while buttons function as eyes and twigs or carrots take the place of a nose. In polar biomes where the temperatures often stay below freezing for prolonged periods, a snowman may retain its structural integrity for months before melting. Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of snowmen ultimately transform into puddles of water when spring or summer finally return. Yet on rare occasions, the normally inanimate mound of ice and snow surreptitiously witnesses something so vile and unspeakable, it breathes a spark of malevolence into the frozen bystander. Birthed from pure evil, the harmless childrenâs creation slowly morphs into a despicable snowman.</p>
<p>Despite its innocent, earthly origins, the despicable snowman owes its existence to the corrupt souls of the netherworld. When one of the wicked spirits from the Lower Planes spies upon the mortal world through the snowmanâs lifeless eyes, the excitement of observing a violent act transforms the ice and snow into a living, sentient outsider.</p>
<p>While the monstrosity revels in meting out suffering, the devious creature displays a remarkable ability to control its brutal impulses. It prefers to lull its victims into a false sense of security, setting them at ease with idyllic winter scenes created by its potent illusory magic. The despicable snowman typically lurks in the wilderness surrounding polar communities.</p>
<p>Sometimes it occupies the same location for several days or weeks, hoping its innocuous presence becomes part of its surroundings. Other times, it vigilantly watches a remote residence where it waits for an opportunity to pounce on a wayward inhabitant. When it selects a victim, the murderous being uses its icy gaze to freeze its target in its tracks. The despicable snowman enjoys watching life slowly ebb from its paralyzed foe.</p>
<p>Despicable snowmen vary greatly in appearance, though they tend to share regional characteristics based upon their creatorsâ similar manner of dress and local customs. Most feature button noses or eyes, a hat, scarf, and other clothing articles normally worn by people in the area.</p>
<p>Some consist of a single, sculpted mound of snow or ice, while others are made from several spheres of packed snow placed on top of one another. Their height ranges between four and six feet. Regardless of its composition, the despicable snowman moves by sliding across snow and ice. Indeed, the monster greatly struggles moving over any other surface.</p>

<h4><span id="Filth_Wallow_Ex">Filth Wallow (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An ofalth gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a> 2 in any area with a high <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a> of debris, garbage or excrement, such as a landfill or sewer.</p>
<h4><span id="Fling_Offal_Ex">Fling Offal (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, an ofalth may pick up a wad of refuse and throw it at an opponent. Treat this as a thrown weapon attack with a range increment of 30 feet. A creature struck by the offal takes 2d10 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1.5 times the ofalthâs strength modifier, and is exposed to the ofalthâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>. If an ofalth is not in an area that can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Activate-Magic-Item">activate</a> its filth wallow ability, it must tear off chunks of its own body to use this attack, taking 2d6 points of damage when it does.</p>
<h4><span id="Putrid_Stench_Ex">Putrid Stench (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A creature that fails its save against an ofalthâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Stench-Ex-">stench</a> is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4+1 rounds. A creature that succeeds its save is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1 round, and is then immune to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Stench-Ex-">stench</a> of that ofalth for 24 hours. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> based.</p>
<p>This vaguely humanoid mass has long, tentacle-like arms and stout legs. It appears to be formed of vines and roots interwoven with both inorganic and organic garbage. The smell is abominable.</p>
<p>An ofalth is a disgusting monster sometimes called a sewer shambler or other, ruder, names. They are kin to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/shambling-mound">shambling mounds</a>, but only the core of their body is composed of vegetative matter. They bulk themselves up with trash of all kinds, from broken equipment to decomposing food to manure both animal and human. They lurk in sewers, trash heaps and manure lagoons, where they act as ambush predators and seek their favorite foodâdecomposing meat.</p>
<p>An ofalthâs body carries in it a grotesque <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> called wretched weeps. Creatures infected find their skin literally tearing off of their body in clumps, and an isolated patient may bleed to death long before their strength is fully sapped by the disease. Ofalths are fascinated with the blood and bones of animal-based life, and often capture living victims to watch how they respond to the disease before vivisecting them.</p>
<p>Ofalths and otuyghs compete for food and territory. These battles typically end with the loser being consumed by the winner; both species generally find the other to be delicious. A single ofalth is much stronger than an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh">otyugh</a>, and so otuyghs need to gather in large groups in order to defeat them. Some <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh">otyugh</a> clusters may recruit adventurers to assist them in these matters.</p>

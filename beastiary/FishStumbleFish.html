<p> A stumble fish can jump out of the water to make an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> attempt. It can jump up to 10 ft out of the water without having to make an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check. This jump is part of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> attempt. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate aquatic<br/> <b>Organization</b> group (2-5) or school (7-10)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p> The stumble fish is a dangerous predator in shallow waters. Its natural aggression and bravery leads this fish to attack creatures larger than itself. Whenever a small or medium-size creature enters the water, the stumble fish swims directly toward the new target and tries to knock it over. Once its prey falls, all the stumble fish in its school swarm the creature and take bites out of it. Inhabiting the waterways of the River Nations, a stumble fish brings a high price at most markets. Its tasty meat makes it a prized fish to eat. Combined with the danger of catching such a fish, the stumble fish is quite expensive. </p>
<p> Schools of stumble fish tend to avoid densely populated areas and prefer waterways near farms and small villages. Difficult to domesticate, stumble fish are believed to be appeased by some farmers who throw food into nearby riverlets. The farmers hope that the local stumble fish schools will be too full to attack when the farmers need to work in or near the water. While this may indeed work, the disappearance of more than a few farmers has been blamed on schools of stumble fish swarming near the farm villages. </p>
<p> An adult stumble fish is over 3 ft. long and weighs about 8 pounds. </p>

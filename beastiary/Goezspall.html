<p class="description">This strange, alien-looking monstrosity has thickly armored hide and several sharp talons at the end of each of its stumpy legs.</p>

<h4><span id="Hibernate_Ex">Hibernate (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Although it can live in extreme conditions, a goezspall still requires food and water. To survive when sustenance is not available, a goezspall can enter a state of hibernation at will; doing so takes 1 minute. While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a>, as if it were in a deep <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep">sleep</a>. A goezspall can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishesâwhile in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for the creature. If a goezspall is jostled or damaged while hibernating, it can attempt a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 24 hours to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/awaken">awaken</a> from hibernation. A goezspall can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/awaken">awaken</a> after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, a goezspall needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw necessary.</p>
<h4><span id="Immune_to_Pressure_Damage_Ex">Immune to Pressure Damage (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A goezspall can survive in extreme conditions. A goezspall is immune to damage caused by high-pressure environments such as deep underwater and low-pressure environments such as the void of space.</p>
<h4><span id="Scalding_Spray_Su">Scalding Spray (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> once every 1d4 rounds, a goezspall can spray a 60-foot line of scalding water at its enemies that deals 12d6 points of fire damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 25 half). This stream acts as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush">bull rush</a> against creatures of any size. When using this ability, a goezspall attempts a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check and applies its results to each creature within the area. This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush">bull rush</a> does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>.

<p>Though rare, goezspalls have been observed living in extremely varied locations. From the frozen north to the depths of the deepest caverns, these bizarre, segmented creatures thrive in any environment, including the depths of the sea, boiling hot springs, and even, some claim, the void of space. Though not typically hostile, these omnivores hunt aggressively when hungry, especially after months or years in hibernation. A goezspall is 14 feet long and weighs 3,500 pounds, though some lore describes smaller and larger specimens.</p>

<h1>Necro-pede</h1>
<p class="title">Necro-Pede <span class="level">CR 7</span></p>
<p class="description">Half of this abnormal creature is still buried beneath the dirt but what you can see defies belief. Its segmented purple body is covered in sets of knubby limbs and tentacles, and its countless orange eyesâof varying sizes and not at all symmetrical in any fashionâgaze at you with an unmistakable brilliance.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> A necro-pede lures foes into an area where it can use its size to its advantage before engaging in combat or allowing them to touch it.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> The necro-pede relies heavily upon the shock factor of its appearance to panic and scatter its foes, allowing it to use its bulk to smash them to death.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Surviving only through deceit and guile, necropedes are willing to negotiate to save their lives and offer more powerful foes items or knowledge if it means continuing to do so. However, necro-pedes are not known for being trustworthy and leaving one alive is a good way to inspire its vengeance at the first chance it gets.</p>

<p>Necro-pedes appear to weaker minded sentient creatures as they believe their Gods would appear. This ability can be overcome with a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save based on a creatureâs intelligence. Once a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save has succeeded against any necro-pede, that particular necropede always appears in its natural form to that creature.</p>
<p>Any successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save within a group of companions allows the successful character to bolster his comrades with a +5 for each successfully saved target. Physical contact with the necro-pede instantly destroys the illusion, causing the viewer to make a DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked">panicked</a> for 1d4 rounds.</p>

<p>Speaking entirely through <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-">telepathy</a>, the necro-pede can force its victims (DC 12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a>) to hear their own language when they engage in conversation, henceforth allowing the necro-pede to forgo learning any Terran languages.

<p>Necro-pedes feed off of the fear of their victims and typically establish the practice of sacrifice amongst their worshipers to guarantee a steady supply of food.</p>

<p>In its natural form the necro-pede has the appearance of a monstrous myriapod, with skin tones taking on hues of a translucent yellowed creme that allow one to see the inner purple circulatory system. Although they are very secretive as to their origins, it is believed necro-pedes are in fact not terrestrial, but arrive upon worlds burrowed inside meteors.</p>
<p>A necro-pede is 15 feet long and weighs around 4,000 pounds.</p>

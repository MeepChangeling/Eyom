<h4><a name="TOC-Arc-Ex-"></a>Arc (Ex)</h4>
<p>Once per round, a tumblespark can release a jolt of electricity against a single opponent within 10 feet that deals 4d6 points of electricity damage. A successful DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Insubstantial-Form-Ex-"></a>Insubstantial Form (Ex)</h4>
<p>A tumblespark’s natural form is a ball of dancing and arcing electricity; it is not solid, nor is it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-">incorporeal</a>. Any piercing or slashing attack has a 20% miss chance against a tumblespark. Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or bramble (3-6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Riding the strong winds and electrical storms of the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning, tumblesparks seek constantly to unleash their pent up electric energy. A tumblespark appears as a man-sized sphere of electricity, rolling and sliding across the ground. Its form crackles and dances with bluish-white electricity. A tumblespark can grow to a diameter of 10 feet or more. As they spin and move they continually generate huge amounts of electricity. Magnetism draws them towards living creatures until the spark is fully discharged. Unfortunately for planar travelers unlucky enough to encounter a bramble of these creatures, this energy never seems to fully dissipate.</p>
<p>Tumblesparks are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane by spellcasters to safeguard some precious item or location, but more often than not any encounter with a tumblespark on a material plane is the result of the creature rolling or crashing through a portal. On a material plane, a tumblespark is likely to be encountered in areas of great electrical activity.</p>

<h1>Hunting Horror</h1>
<p class="title">Hunting Horror <span class="level">CR 16</span></p>
<p class="description">Flowing down directly from the sky, like black lightning, this wormlike creature appears before you, reeking of ancient rot. From between its armored plates seeps a grotesque mucus falling constantly like an unholy rain. Its many eyes stare at you with vile hatred.</p>

<h4><span id="Mucus_Su">Mucus (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A hunting horrorâs âfleshâ constantly weeps thick foul mucus, seemingly melting off its serpentine frame as swiftly as it rebuilds and restores its shape. When a hunting horror lands on a surface, the mucus swiftly spreads out in a ten-foot radius around the creature and hardens into a thick mud-like consistency. This area is treated as difficult terrain by all save hunting horrors.</p>
<p>Each round a creature other than a hunting horror begins its turn within this area, it must make a successful DC 27 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> for as long as it remains within the area. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Shared_Consciousness_Ex">Shared Consciousness (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>All hunting horrors are branches of the same immense organism that has spread throughout several dimensions across the reaches of space, and anything one hunting horror experiences is experienced by all. When multiple hunting horrors are encountered, none of them are considered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a> unless all of them are.</p>
<h4><span id="Swallow_Whole_Ex">Swallow Whole (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A hunting horrorâs body constantly reforms and repairs itself. The hole created when a creature cuts its way out of a hunting horror instantly seals as soon as the escaping creature exits.</p>
<h4><span id="Telepathic_Assault_Su">Telepathic Assault (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As it attacks, a hunting horror bombards its preyâs consciousness with its mind, sending grisly and horrific images into the victimâs thoughts in an attempt to undermine the potential mealâs defenses and to flavor the flesh with the tang of fear and despair.</p>
<p>Whenever a hunting horror attacks a creature, regardless of whether the attack successfully hits or not, that creature must make a successful DC 26 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round by despair and horror at the images projected by the hunting horror. An already staggered creature that fails this saving throw is also <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect.</p>
<p>The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or pack (3â5)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>It weighs from 3000â6000 pounds, and could never fly if it was restricted to normal laws of physics.</p>
<p>Their flesh secretes a mucus so rapidly that it constantly drips off as if the hunting horror were falling apart. After sloughing off, the thick piles of mucus begin to harden, becoming like mud. It is possible to slowly plod through it, but not swim in it like water.</p>
<p>The mucus begins to pile up during a fight, eventually covering the horrorâs prey and holding them in place so they cannot escape when the horror swallows them whole.</p>
<p>Hunting horrors speak to their prey mentally.</p>
<p>To them it is playing with their food. They send fantastically horrible images to the minds of those they are going to swallow.</p>
<p>Hunting horrors are all a branch of the same immense organism that spans great reaches of space. They are each the nerves and nerve endings of this being. This is how they can appear instantly and avoid sunlight. The creature as a whole is practically a Great Old One in terms of power.</p>

<h4><span id="Engulfing_Miasma_Ex">Engulfing Miasma (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A toxic eradicator can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Engulf-Ex-">engulf</a> creatures in its path as part of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it engulfs, moving over its opponents and affecting all that share its space. Creatures can avoid being engulfed with a successful DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save (being pushed back or aside as it moves forward, as they choose), or may forego their save to attempt an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a> against the toxic eradicator. Engulfed creatures are exposed to the eradicator’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Mephitic_Smog_Su">Mephitic Smog (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A toxic eradicator surrounds itself with a bank of churning smog that moves with it and obscures vision within 30 feet as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fog-cloud">fog cloud</a>. Any creature beginning its turn or moving within 30 feet of the toxic eradicator is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> (DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> negates) for as long as it remains within the cloud and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. Creatures remaining within the smog must save again each round, though a creature beginning its turn outside the smog can attempt a new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save each round at the end of its turn to remove the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> condition.</p>
<p>The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Poison_Ex">Poison (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Touch-contact; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 18; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a>; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive saves.

<h4><span id="Pinpoint_Poisoner_Su">Pinpoint Poisoner (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a toxic eradicator can automatically dispel an effect like <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/delay-poison">delay poison</a> that provides temporary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. In addition, for 1 minute the DC is increased by 5 for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> checks or any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> checks when using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a> to treat any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> affecting that creature, and if the target has any ability or effect that grants a saving throw bonus against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>, that bonus or effect is suppressed.</p>
<h4><span id="Vaporous_Form_Ex">Vaporous Form (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A toxic eradicator’s body is composed of noxious vapors rather than being truly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a>, but it shares all traits of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> subtype except as follows: It cannot move through solid objects or barriers but can pass through holes or openings as small as 1 inch in diameter with no reduction in speed. It is affected by wind conditions as if it were three size categories smaller.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Created as a living bioweapon by jagladine scientists, the aptly named toxic eradicator was initially developed to purge the unsuccessful or dangerous results of tampering and experimentation. The toxic eradicator was designed with just enough intelligence to slavishly obey its masters but with more than enough cunning to make it a relentless hunter of its victims. The main inbuilt limitation of the toxic eradicator is that its only attack vector is poison. Any creature which is immune to poison is completely safe from a toxic eradicator’s attack, a fact that the toxic eradicator has been bred to recognize. Genetically programmed to kill, a toxic eradicator focuses its attacks on a single opponent and only retreats if all of its remaining foes are seemingly immune to its poison. In combat, it uses its pinpoint poisoner ability against a foe that it sees performing certain actions, such as drinking something, reading a scroll, or casting a spell, and afterwards seems immune to its attacks. Without orders to follow, a toxic eradicator usually finds an indoor or underground area, ideally one with small cracks or vents that it can use to move through and lurks there waiting for more victims.</p>

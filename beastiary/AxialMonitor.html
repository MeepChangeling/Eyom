<h4><span id="Tripartite_Assault_Ex">Tripartite Assault (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When it makes a full attack, an Axial monitor can choose to make a full attack with one weapon and secondary attacks with its tentacle and slam, or it can choose to make a single attack with each weapon it wields, including its tentacle and slam attacks, with no penalties to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a> for fighting with multiple weapons.</p>
<h4><span id="Watchful_Faces_Ex">Watchful Faces (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An Axial monitor can make three additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> in a round, one for each head, although it can make no more than a single attack for any given opportunity.</p>

<p>Axial monitors are tasked with preventing disturbances of order and, when crimes do occur, investigating them to bring the perpetrators to justice. Each Axial monitor has the same unusual form: its large, hairless head bears three faces set equidistantly around it, each expression the picture of bland serenity. These faces appear roughly humanoid but are completely smooth, without contours for a brow, nose, or mouth, as though its faces were painted on canvas.</p>
<p>Axial monitors only attack those presenting a disturbance to Axisâs order, whether through the commission of a crime or another civil malfeasance. They call for surrender before a fight and prefer to subdue opponents rather than slay them. Their mandate is to bring prisoners into their dispatch stations so they can be examined and interrogated, and the reasons for their disturbance identified and measured in formal reports.</p>
<p>After incarceration and calculation, an offender is either set free or transferred to rehabilitative prisons under escort by Axial monitors. Although they follow this same process for nearly all creatures, the Axial monitors show no mercy or leniency to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/protean">proteans</a> and always attack these embodiments of disorder with lethal force on sight.</p>
<p>Axial monitors are 12 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.</p>
<p>Axial monitors maintain a low profile unless in pursuit of a criminal or when investigating a crime.</p>
<p>Their rarity engenders several mysteries about their creation and their purpose. It is unclear whether Axial monitors are created by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/axiomite">axiomites</a>, are created from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/axiomite">axiomites</a>, or are incarnations formed by Axis itself to maintain its mathematically perfect conceptions of peace and order. Axial monitors do not seem to be a distinct species because they do not procreate or age. Axial monitors have never been observed to eat, drink, or sleep, and some speculate that their fortified dispatch stations must be where the creatures rest. The only non-monitors allowed inside these dispatch stations are criminals and rare <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/axiomite">axiomite</a> specialists, but they are restricted to chambers near a stationâs arched entrance. No one knows precisely how many Axial monitors there are, which lends some credence to the theory that they are generated directly as need dictates.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_And_Society">Habitat And Society</span></h3>
<p>Inevitables served both as law enforcement and as shock troops in the wars between law and chaos when the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Outer-Planes">Outer Planes</a> were young. However, as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/inevitable">inevitables</a> have expanded their role to enforcing the will of law across the multiverse and to combating chaos in all its incarnations, Axial monitors assumed many of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/inevitable">inevitables</a>â former law-enforcement duties.</p>
<p>Axial monitors keep the peace in as harmonious a way as possible. They do not patrol as peace officers do, but are dispatched directly when needed. An Axial monitorâs unflappable countenance and unusual appearanceâbordering between bizarre and comicalâis off-putting and alien to most creatures. Few creatures expect sympathy or kinship from the strange-looking Axial monitors, and it is likely that they were created for precisely this effect.</p>

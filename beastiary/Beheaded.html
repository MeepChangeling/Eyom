<h1>Beheaded</h1>
<p class="description">This humanoid head floats silently and ominously, bits of flesh still hanging from its face and graying teeth clattering slightly as it bobs in the air.</p>

<p>Beheaded can be created with any of the following special abilities. For every two abilities the beheaded possesses, increase the beheaded’s CR by +1 (except swarming which counts as 2 abilities by itself.)</p>
<h4><span id="Belching_Su"><a name="TOC-Belching-Su-"></a>Belching (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The beheaded can make a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> with a maximum range of 30 feet that deals 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen at the time of creation).</p>
<h4><span id="Flaming_Su"><a name="TOC-Flaming-Su-"></a>Flaming (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The beheaded gains fire <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> and a +2 bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>. Its slam attack also deals 1d6 points of fire damage and might catch the target on fire.</p>
<h4><span id="Grabbing_Ex"><a name="TOC-Grabbing-Ex-"></a>Grabbing (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair or other limblike growths (such as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/medusa">medusa’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake">snake</a> hair). Its slam attack gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a> (Medium) special ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Screaming_Su"><a name="TOC-Screaming-Su-"></a>Screaming (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The beheaded can scream out once every 1d4 rounds. Every creature within 30 feet must succeed at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull’s racial <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> + the screaming skull’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier. This is a sonic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect. Whether or not the save is successful, any creature in the area can’t be affected by that beheaded’s scream for the next 24 hours.</p>
<h4><span id="Swarming_Ex"><a name="TOC-Swarming-Ex-"></a>Swarming (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The beheaded gains 1 additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a>, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> subtype, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> immunities, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Distraction-Ex-">distraction</a> special ability. It loses its slam attack but gains a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. This counts as two abilities for the purpose of determining the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/beheaded">beheaded’s</a> CR.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or patrol (3â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A beheaded is a severed head or skull animated as a mindless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> sentinel that silently floats at eye level as it lies in wait for living prey or is sent out into the lands of the living to terrorize everyone it finds. A beheaded set loose near populated areas thumps ominously against shut doors and windows, biding its time until someone responds to the incessant knocking. The beheaded then assaults this victim.</p>
<p>Beheaded also guard grim crypts, abattoirs, and hideouts of murders who like to keep reminders of their past sins close at hand. Beheaded come in many varieties, usually based on the creature the head came from. A beheaded prefers to float at head height so it can more easily attack the face, neck, and shoulders of its victim.</p>

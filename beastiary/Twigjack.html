<p> A twigjack can travel short distances between brambles, shrubs, or thickets as if via <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door"><i>dimension door</i></a> as part of a move action. The twigjack must begin and end this movement while in an area of at least light undergrowth. The twigjack can travel in this manner up to 60 feet per day. This movement must be used in 10-foot increments and does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Splinterspray_Ex"><a name="TOC-Splinterspray-Ex-"></a><b>Splinterspray (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p> A twigjack can eject a barrage of splinters and brambles from its body three times per day as a standard action. This effect creates a 15-foot conical burst of jagged splinters, dealing 4d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures in the area. A DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving throw</a> halves this damage.

<p>Deep in old-growth forests, twigjacks spend their time tormenting intruders and wreaking havoc on settlers. Maladjusted protectors of the wood, these malicious fey constantly threaten any attempts to civilize the wild. Twigjacks delight in breaking wagon wheels from expansionistsâ caravans, snapping huntersâ bows, and sabotaging isolated cabins and villages. Although they possess a keen intellect, few creatures, even other fey, can tolerate these twig-born creatures for long. Treants especially find twigjacks bothersome, and resent any suggestion that they are related. Equally, twigjacks resent being considered plants, and are proud of their fey heritage. Twigjacks sometimes go out of their way to impress dryads, an effort that is rebuffed almost every time. But some spriggans, quicklings, and other evil fey associate with twigjacks, and while goblins fear and distrust the creatures, bugbears often bully them into service.</p>
<p>Gnarled sticks bundled by vines and brambles form a twigjackâs entire body. Atop its head, a mossy growth not unlike hair sprouts. The creatureâs eyes appear as vacant dark knotholes, and its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creatureâs body.</p>

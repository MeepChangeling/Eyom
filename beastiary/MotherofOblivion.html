<h1>Mother of Oblivion</h1>
<p class="description">A monstrous, undulating tangle of barbed tentacles explodes from the water. Its form spurns definable anatomy, a horror of prehistory atop a writhing mass of rubbery tentacles – some crowned with glaring infernal eyes. Its only recognizable feature is the black reptilian head rising above the morass of tentacles, a maw of flesh-sheering teeth gaping wide before two piercing eyes, smoldering with alien intelligence.</p>

<p> Tactics 
<p><b>Before Combat</b> A Mother of Oblivion is rarely surprised. She uses her trans-dimensional tentacles to keep tabs on the terrain and plan the best ambush.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Once battle is joined, the Mother of Oblivion uses her breath of madness and energy-draining bite to weaken foes, then merely swats them aside with her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/awesome-blow">Awesome Blow</a>.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> A Mother of Oblivion knows no fear, but is wise enough to know when she has lost the advantage. She flees if reduced to fewer than half her hit points.</p>

<h4><span id="All-Around_Vision_Ex"><a name="TOC-All-Around-Vision-Ex-"></a>All-Around Vision (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The eyes at the tips of several of a Mother of Oblivion’s tentacles grants her a +8 <a href="//basics-ability-scores/glossary-final#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks. She cannot be flanked.</p>
<h4><span id="Breath_of_Madness_Su"><a name="TOC-Breath-of-Madness-Su-"></a>Breath of Madness (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A Mother of Oblivion can exhale a cloud of foul-smelling, narcotic breath: 60-foot cone, once per minute, 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and confusion for 1d6 rounds, <a href="//gamemastering-final/combat-final#TOC-Reflex" rel="nofollow">Reflex</a> DC 27 for half <a href="//basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> damage and no confusion. This breath is a mind-affecting poison effect.</p>
<p>The save DC is <a href="//basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Trans-dimensional_Tentacles_Su"><a name="TOC-Trans-dimensional-Tentacles-Su-"></a>Trans-dimensional Tentacles (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A Mother of Oblivion’s tentacles allow her to see into and infiltrate multiple planes at once. At all times, a Mother of Oblivion is cognizant of the plane she inhabits bodily and all coterminous planes-such as the Ethereal Plane and Plane of Shadow from the Material Plane. Not only is she aware of these planes and the creatures there, she can reach her tentacles through to attack. By worming her tentacles through the dimensions, a Mother of Oblivion can effectively reach through solid barriers into any area not protected by a dimensional lock or similar effect.</p>
<p>While a Mother of Oblivion can attack and even grapple creatures on other planes, she cannot move creatures from one plane to another.</p>
<h4><span id="Warp_Dimensions_Su"><a name="TOC-Warp-Dimensions-Su-"></a>Warp Dimensions (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A Mother of Oblivion’s presence distorts the dimensions. Any creature that attempts to utilize a teleport effect within 300 feet of a Mother of Oblivion must make a DC 21 caster level check or the teleport effect fails to activate. The creature must also make a DC 27 <a href="//gamemastering-final/combat-final#TOC-Fortitude" rel="nofollow">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="//gamemastering-final/conditions-final#TOC-Nauseated" rel="nofollow">nauseated</a> for 1d6 rounds.</p>
<p>The save DC is <a href="//basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. </p></div>

<h1>Goemul</h1>
<p class="title">Goemul <span class="level">CR 11</span></p>
<p class="description">The stench of death assaults your senses as a strange amalgamation of rotting remains, wood, and vegetations rises from the disgusting water. Itâs eyes glow an unnatural blue and stare at you intently as one of its malformed limbs reaches down into the murk briefly before the massive thing rips upward with a wave and sends an enormous rock hurtling right at you!</p>

<h4><span id="Animate_Corpses_Sp">Animate Corpses (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A goemul can animate any corpses within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two creatures at a time (of a combined HD equal to the goemulâs). It takes 1 full round for a corpse to rise, after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a goemul (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the goemulâs animation and rock-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/throwing" style="font-style: italic">throwing</a> abilities). If the goemul that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the corpse immediately falls <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a> wherever it is and returns to its normal state.</p>
<h4><span id="Change_Shape_Su">Change Shape (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Goemul can transform into rotting remains, with results similar to the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tree-shape">tree shape</a> spell. In this form, the goemul appears as a recently killed creature of Small size. A goemul can assume this form or revert to its true form as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Deadspeech_Ex">Deadspeech (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A goemul has the ability to converse with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> as if subject to a continual <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-dead">speak with dead</a> spell, and most corpses greet them with an attitude of friendly or helpful.</p>
<h4><span id="Violent_Burst_Su">Violent Burst (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When slain, a goemul explodes in a burst of rotting matter filled with negative energy. All creatures within 30 feet of a slain goemul take 1d8 points of negative energy damage plus 1 point per HD of the slain goemul, and the surrounding area is strewn with gruesome remains of countless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> creatures, dense enough to make the region into difficult terrain for 24 hours, after which the remains change into a disgusting mold.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any, swamps, underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Creatures wrought by sadistic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a>, these tortured <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/treant">treants</a> live an existence stretched taut between life and death. Cursed to wander for centuries, compelled to lurk beneath disgusting, brackish waterways and fetid swamps.</p>

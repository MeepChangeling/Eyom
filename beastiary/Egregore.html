<h4><a name="TOC-Cult-Mind-Su-"></a>Cult Mind (Su)</h4>
<p>An egregore is created by the combined will of a number of cult members equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (minimum 13), and can have a maximum number of members in its cult mind equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. Each member must be an intelligent, living creature. These cultists pour their collective psychic consciousness into the collaborative creation of the egregore, granting each member a number of advantages. Creating an egregore involves a ritual lasting 1 day and costing 1,000 gp per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> of the egregore. New creatures can be added to the cult mind only if previous members die or depart (see below).</p>
<p>Adding a new member to the cult mind requires a ritual lasting 1 day and costing 1,000 gp. All the other members who are still a part of the cult mind must be present during this ritual or it fails.</p>
<p>As long as a member of the cult mind is within 1 mile of the egregore, the egregore can use any of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> on that member, regardless of the spell’s range. If a member of the cult mind is targeted by a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> spell, the egregore can attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save as well, and the cult member uses the better of the two results. If the cult member still fails, another member of the cult mind can choose to be affected instead.</p>
<p>In addition, the members of the cult mind share a limited form of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-">telepathy</a>: they are able to send and receive simple messages and emotions, much like the empathic link between a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizard</a> and his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/familiar">familiar</a>.</p>
<p>If a member of the cult mind is slain or travels more than 1 mile from the egregore, its link to the cult mind is severed, and every other member must succeed at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1 round. If the number of members in the cult mind drops below half of the number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> possessed by the egregore, the egregore must succeed at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or suffer from <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">confusion</a>. The egregore can attempt a new save at the start of each round to regain its senses. As long as the remaining number of members is less than half the egregore’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>, the egregore must attempt a new save each time a member of its cult mind is slain or leaves the cult mind. If the last member of the cult is slain or leaves the cult mind, the egregore dissipates harmlessly in 1d4 rounds.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Hypnotic-Oscillation-Sp-"></a>Hypnotic Oscillation (Sp)</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, an egregore can weave a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hypnotic-pattern">hypnotic pattern</a> using its bands of light in a 10-foot radius around itself. Members of its cult mind are immune and don’t count towards the spell’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> limit, but otherwise this ability functions as the spell.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Light-Tentacles-Su-"></a>Light Tentacles (Su)</h4>
<p>An egregore produces bands of light powered by its concentrated mental energy. It can cause these bands to become solid and lash out as tentacles.</p>
<p>These tentacles follow all the normal rules for tentacles, except that they function as though they had the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/brilliant-energy">brilliant energy</a> weapon special ability.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Psychic-Conduit-Ex-"></a>Psychic Conduit (Ex)</h4>
<p>Any member of a cult mind can channel any psychic spells it casts through the egregore, as long as the cultist is within 30 feet of the egregore. If a cultist casts spells in this way, treat the egregore as if it were the spellcaster for purposes of the spell’s range, point of origin, and other functions that depend on the caster’s location.</p>
<p>The creature casting the spell still provokes any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> or other negative consequences of casting a spell. The egregore takes 1d6 points of slashing damage per level of spell cast through it in this way as the energy cuts its way out of the creature, though its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> applies. (A 0-level spell channeled through the egregore deals no damage to it.)</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> cult (1 plus 13â20 cultists)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Though egregores’ appearances vary, they typically have a core that resembles a mass of brains, discernible by practitioners of phrenology as bearing characteristics of the brains of those who make up its cult mind. This core projects an image that reflects the ideals for which the egregore was formedâan unblinking eye to represent vigilance, a heraldic shield for protection, or some other stylized emblem to reflect the goals of the group.</p>
<p>From this bizarre hovering mass emerges a number of pulsating arcs of light that move in a strange unison, forming an almost mesmerizing pattern with their cadence.</p>
<p>The egregore itself is a totally separate creature, akin to the eidolons of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner">summoners</a>, though it seems to be a genuine living being of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> and not a true <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsider</a>. Creating an egregore requires a cult of 13âone leader and a dozen followers. Larger cults are capable of creating more powerful egregores, with stories circulating of doomsday cults with hundreds of members working together to create an abomination, but subsequently losing control and facing annihilation from their own creation. The egregore exists only as long as the cult that created it, fading back into the psychic ether from which it spawned once the cult is no more.</p>
<p>An egregore is 12 feet across, though the bands of light that extend out from it cause it to fluctuate between an effective size of 13 feet to 15 feet. It weighs only 300 pounds despite its vast size. The brains that make up the egregore’s body aren’t constructed like human brains, and are far less dense; they seem to take the form of brains only because of the conceptual link they represent. Likewise, the egregore’s staring eye and bands of light are more metaphorical than physical.</p>

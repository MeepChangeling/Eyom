<h1>Chelicerae</h1>
<p class="description">A massive spider perched upon tall, stilted legs skitters forward, crackling with eldritch energy as the disheveled body of a robed arcanist swings corpse-like from its clenched mandibles.</p>

<p>Chelicerae cannot replenish spell slots naturally and, instead, extract them from the minds of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> locked in its mandibles The chelicerae treats the bodies of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> spellcasters as a spell point reservoir for as long as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> is maintained, draining unused spell slots to power the casting of their own spells, 1 point/spell level.</p>
<p>All 0-level spells become at-will abilities. Whenever the chelicerae wishes to cast any one of its spells known, it consumes a number of spell slots from its victim equal to the spell slots necessary to cast the spell (including increased levels for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats">metamagic feats</a> and so on). If the body has insufficient number of spell slots available, the chelicerae cannot cast that spell. However, the arachnid can also draw out spell slots from drained spellcasters or creatures without magic ability.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, the chelicerae can inflict 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> to any creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> in its mandibles, adding 2 spell slots to its spell reservoir for every point of damage inflicted. A victim is reduced to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> in this manner cannot power any more magical abilities, including 0-level spell slots. Unconscious victims held long-term by the chelicerae do not heal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">ability damage</a> or regain spell slots while this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> is maintained.</p>
<h4><span id="Spells"><a name="TOC-Spells"></a>Spells</span></h4>
<p>As long as the arachnid has spell slots on which to draw, it casts spells as an 8th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerer</a>, but does not gain any other class abilities. Spells points in the reservoir given above assume the chelicerae is encountered with an 8th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizard</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wis</a> 12, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Int</a> 16) <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> within its mandibles with no current <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any forests, underground, or wastes<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Walking on high, stilted legs, these creatures at first seem like gigantic harvestmen. But more often than not, the arachnids are discovered with the grisly bodies of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> dangling morbidly by their heads from the chelicerae’s clenched mandibles.</p>
<p>This hunter prefers to stalk isolated victims, incapacitate them with its poisonous bite, then pin them within its jaws. There their helpless body can hang for days on end as the chelicerae pursues obscure and eldritch tasks. At best, these unfortunates wake up weeks later in a stupor with no memory of the events, far from the location of their capture and drained of vitality and spells. At worst, they find themselves immobilized in a thick cocoon in a high treetop until their body and mind recovers enough to be used again, or they are slain and animated as walking dead to protect the chelicerae.</p>

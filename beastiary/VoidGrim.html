<h1>Void Grim</h1>
<p class="description">This tall, muscular giant has mottled gray and brown skin with numerous pockmarks, looking not so much hewn from stone as blasted from it. When it lifts its arm, a nearly translucent membrane connecting its upper arm to its chest spreads out.</p>

<h4><span id="Glide_Ex">Glide (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>In airless environments, a void grim can fly without difficulty. However, in areas with atmosphere, a void grim automatically fails <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly">Fly</a> checks made to hover and must descend at least 10 feet each round. If a void grim flies at faster than half speed, it must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or tear its wing membrane, causing it to fall. A torn wing membrane heals naturally in 2d4 days, or it can be repaired immediately with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate">regenerate</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Irradiate_Ex">Irradiate (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Every 1d4+1 rounds, a void grim can release a burst of cosmic radiation it has stored in its body. All creatures within 5 feet of the void grim when it uses this ability take 2d6 points of fire damage and 1d2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>.</p>
<p>A successful DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save reduces the fire damage by half and negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>Void grims are a mutant race descended from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/giant-stone">stone giants</a> who once dwelt in high-atmosphere mountains where they could work freely and avoid other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants">giants</a>. With the destruction of their home world, however, they found the strange radiations of the ores they had long worked had adapted them to the lack of atmosphere, and they continued to mine among the shattered asteroids they now called home. Their demeanor and survivability in the void gave them their names, though they refer to themselves as kabbarin. Void grims stand 11 feet tall and weigh between 1,700 and 2,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Many outsiders view void grims as overly serious giants who spend all their waking moments in asteroid mines. There is some truth to this. Void grims are deadly earnest miners who brook no carelessness on the part of others. While they enjoy protection from space and can recover when an asteroid accidentally breaks apart, they know how easy it is for mishaps to occur and realize others don’t have the same level of protection.</p>
<p>Some void grims are exceedingly protective of their claims; an enclave of such giants works a mine all throughout the day in shifts. During downtime and away from other races, however, void grims carouse and celebrate their daily takes.</p>
<p>Void grims raise their children communally, with the infirm or elderly providing most of the care. When children have fully developed their flight membranes, they learn how to navigate in solar winds. The membranes are strong enough to give the giants rudimentary flight in the airless void or thin atmosphere, but they are fragile in normal atmosphere. Even though void grims reach adulthood at age 20, their children begin working mines when they are as young as 7. Adult miners supervise children and have them work relatively safe mines until they prove their capabilities. They apply the same attitude toward non-void grim miners and seem condescending to outsiders. Void grims are standoffish towards other but not aggressive, except when interlopers encroach on their claims.</p>
<p>They become truly enraged when they discover breathless ones and dispatch the creatures immediately on sight. Void grims’ lack of a need for air makes them uniquely suited to combat breathless ones.</p>

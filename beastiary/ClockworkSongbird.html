<p>A clockwork songbirdâs intricate mechanical voice box allows it to sing a number of songs, each of which provides a distinct effect. Starting a song is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, and it can be maintained each round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>; stopping a song is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. A clockwork songbirdâs song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the clockwork songbird cannot take a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> to maintain it. A clockwork songbird can sing only one song at a time.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Airy Aria</em>: The clockwork songbird can whistle a lilting melody that causes allies to feel light on their feet. As long as the clockwork songbird maintains its airy aria, each ally within 60 feet that can hear it gains a +10-foot bonus to its base speed or a +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus">dodge bonus</a> to AC and a +1 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saves (recipientâs choice). These benefits do not stack with those provided by the airy arias of other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-clockwork">clockwork</a> songbirds.</li>
<li><em>Gentle Lullaby</em>: The gentle, crooning lullaby of a clockwork songbird can cause enemies to drift toward slumber. Each round that a clockwork songbird sings its gentle lullaby, each foe within 30 feet that can hear it must attempt a DC 11 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. If the creature fails the save, it becomes drowsy; while drowsy, the creature takes a â2 penalty to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>. If the creature is already drowsy and fails the DC 11 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save, the creature falls asleep and gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> condition. Slapping or wounding the affected creature fully awakens it, but normal noise does not. Alternatively, an ally can fully awaken a creature that is drowsy or fully asleep due to a gentle <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/lullaby">lullaby</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. A creature that becomes fully asleep due to the gentle lullaby cannot be affected by gentle lullaby for 24 hours. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect.</li>
<li><em>Inspiring Anthem</em>: The clockwork songbird sings a hopeful song that, though somewhat piping and thin, rings true across the battlefield and instills a sense of duty in the hearts of the songbirdâs allies. As long as the clockwork songbird maintains its inspiring anthem, allies within 60 feet that can hear it gain a +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus">morale bonus</a> on attack and damage rolls.</li>
</ul>

<p>Marvels of machinery and musicality, clockwork songbirds are prized for the beautiful melodies they produce, which can vary based on the songbirdâs construction. These clockwork creatures often inhabit the homes and gardens of nobility, where they fill opulent manors and wide-open green spaces alike with their lilting songs. Both children and adults delight in clockwork songbirds, with the former seeing these mechanical creatures as amusing toys and the latter as party novelties.</p>
<p>A clockwork songbird is typically no longer than 18 inches and weighs about 5 pounds.</p>

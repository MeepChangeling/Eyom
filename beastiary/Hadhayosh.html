<h1>Hadhayosh</h1>
<p class="description">This titanic bull has skin like brass and a mane of flames. It towers over the treetops, stopping periodically to eat from the foliage above. Mighty twisted horns thrust forward from above its massive head. Its hooves are cloven and a powerful tail thrashes about behind it.</p>

<h4><span id="Frightful_Charge_Su"><a name="TOC-Frightful-Charge-Su-"></a>Frightful Charge (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A hadhayosh can inspire terror by charging. A creature charged by a hadhayosh must succeed on a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed" rel="nofollow">paralyzed</a> with fear, remaining in that condition as long as they stay within 60 feet of the hadhayosh. This is a mind-affecting <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear">fear</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<p>A hadhayoshâs horns are treated as silver and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a> for the purposes of overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Heat_Ex"><a name="TOC-Heat-Ex-"></a>Heat (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A hadhayosh generates so much heat that its mere touch deals 1d6 fire damage. A hadhayosh controls the heat it emits, allowing it to carry riders without harming them.</p>
<h4><span id="Rush_Ex"><a name="TOC-Rush-Ex-"></a>Rush (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Once per minute, the hadhayhosh can move at a speed of 150 feet.</p>

<p>Although physically similar to a titanic ox, a hadhayosh’s body generates far greater heat and grows dense metal instead of normal horns or hooves. Although gigantic creatures, these massive oxen require surprisingly little food to survive and seem to be able to flourish by drinking any liquid. Some witnesses tell of seeing adult hadhayoshes drinking from volcanoes, lapping up magma thirstily without regard to the heat or chunks of cooling stone. Young hadhayoshes are rarely seen, the creatures’ low fecundity in part accounting for their rarity. When spotted, though, such youths appear much like full-grown <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/gorgon">gorgons</a> with gleaming brass skin. Although appearing similar, little else connects the two species, though this hardly lessens the number of strange theories regarding their origins.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society">Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Hadhayoshes graze lightly over large territories, preferring warm, hilly regions and deserts. They enjoy areas with healthy amounts of foliage on which to dine, favoring trees over grasses because they are much easier to reach from their height. They travel frequently, sometimes staying in one locale for weeks, then spontaneously migrating hundreds of miles. Whenever possible they wait for at least a year before returning to the same area, seeming to dislike even passing through areas they’ve previously walked. Few obstacles serve as barriers to hadhayoshes, with some even walking between continents in their travels.</p>
<p>Many peoples believe sighting a hadhayosh is lucky, as the beasts so rarely return to regions they’ve visited before. When one of these fantastic creatures draws near, whole villages might turn out to watch it graze. More than once, though, such wonder has quickly turned to terror as the unmindful beast tramples the homes of its adorers.</p>

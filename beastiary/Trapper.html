<p>A trapper can try to wrap a creature up to one size smaller than itself in its body as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. The trapper attempts a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> that does not provoke an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals slam and acid damage each round the hold is maintained. Further, a grappled opponent must hold its breath or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Suffocation">suffocate</a>. Attacks that hit an engulfing trapper deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. </p>

<p>At one time, trappers were thought to be distant relatives of the lurker above. In reality, the trapper is most likely an advanced type of ooze that evolved within the dungeons of the world. This ooze mimics the texture of the floor of a building, dungeon or other natural structure. By manipulating their body structure while covering the floor, trappers can form a box that resembles a small trunk or chest or even move an existing wooden trunk or chest to rest on top of them. This is usually enough to lure would-be adventurers to their doom and provide the trapper with the sustenance it needs to grow and reproduce.</p>While lying in wait, it can suppress its digestive acids to not provide adventurers with a clue as to its true nature. Once a creature reaches the center of the trapperâs body, it attacks with slam attacks and it then quickly folds and wraps its body around its unsuspecting prey attempting to smother, squeeze and dissolve it until it is dead.

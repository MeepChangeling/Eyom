<h1>Drake, Elemental</h1>
<p class="title">Elemental Drake <span class="level">CR 8</span></p>
<p class="description">The scales of this two-legged dragon are a cascade of red, blue, green, and white hues that shift from one color to the next. A miasma of energy surrounds its powerful jaws and with each breath it takes a bit of something primal spills forthâacid, flame, frost, or lightning.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Elemental drakes target lone travelers or wait for a straggler to lag behind a group.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Elemental drakes use their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> as often as possible but when opponents reveal themselves as spellcasters, they target those enemies specifically with bite and tail slap attacks.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Elemental drakes retreat when reduced to 20 hp or less, tracking enemies for 1d4+2 days before attacking again.</p>

<h4><span id="Elemental_Breath_Su">Elemental Breath (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Elemental drakes are suffused with the power of all four of the basic elements, granting them impressive offensive abilities that shift and change every passing moment.</p>
<p>At the start of a round an elemental drake rolls 1d6 to determine the type of energy damage its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> deals: 2: acid, 3: cold, 4: electricity, 5: fire, 6: force (on a roll of 1 it does not function for that round, but the elemental drakeâs bite is more potent).</p>
<p>On rounds where it can use its elemental <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>, the elemental drake spends a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> (that does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>) to breathe a ball of energy at a point within 60 ft., dealing 9d6 energy damage (DC 20 half) to all creature in a 20-ft.-radius spread. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based and functions underwater.</p>
<h4><span id="Forceful_Bite_Su">Forceful Bite (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An elemental drakeâs bite attack deals +1d6 force damage. On any rounds it is unable to use its elemental breath, the elemental drakeâs bite attack also deals 1d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, rampage (3â12), or maelstrom (16â30)<br/><b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>After being first sighted centuries ago they have become a nascent terror of the skies and open bounties for their capture (preferably alive, a daunting task) are constantly being posted by scholastic institutions and arcane researchers. Incredibly adaptive and lethal, elemental drakes can lair anywhere and many have flown to other lands, some convincing lesser creatures that they are dragonsâamassing great hordes and many followers before coming to the attention of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon">true dragon</a>, often leading to a scourge on the territory (after the elemental drake makes a hasty flight to a new realm).</p>
<p>Elemental drakes are slightly larger than other drakes but sleeker, reaching heights of nearly 17 feet and weighing upward of 2,000 pounds.</p>

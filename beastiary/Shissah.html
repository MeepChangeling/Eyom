<h4><span id="Desert_Dweller_Ex">Desert Dweller (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A shissah feels at home in the desert and does not treat light rubble or sand as difficult terrain. It gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> checks in the desert, and it treats hot temperatures as one category less for the purposes of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Heat-Ex-">heat</a> danger. Thus, a shissah does not suffer unduly in very hot conditions, treating severe <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Heat-Ex-">heat</a> as very hot and extreme <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Heat-Ex-">heat</a> as severe <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Heat-Ex-">heat</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Desert_Senses_Ex">Desert Senses (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A shissah is familiar with mirages and gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on saving throws against mirage effects and against effects that cause the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> condition. It gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks in deserts.</p>
<h4><span id="Easily_Trained_Ex">Easily Trained (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A shissah is unusually quick to pick up tricks and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animal</a> training. Anyone attempting to train a shissah gains a +2 bonus on her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> checks. A shissah can learn an additional 2 tricks beyond what an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animal</a> of its intelligence can normally be taught.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm deserts<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or herd (3â16)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>This sleek equine is slightly smaller than an average horse, but its eyes contain a gleam of higher intelligence.</p>
<p>Shissahs are smaller and seem more delicate than most horses, but their fragile appearance belies their hardiness. They can travel for weeks on minimal water <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Rations">rations</a> and survive on desert scrub and even locusts if necessary. Their large, wide-set eyes, which are surrounded by a thin ring of black, hairless skin, enable them to see despite the glare of the desert sun. Their wide foreheads, tapering to a slender muzzle, indicate their great intelligence. Their high-arched tails are often taken as a sign of their fiery spirit.</p>
<p>Shissahs come in a wide range of colors, and they are often used to refine the lines of other breeds and lend them greater intelligence and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter#TOC-Bravery-Ex-">bravery</a>. Few leave the hands of Keleshite owners, for a shissah is no mere mount, but a fierce and loyal partner.</p>
<h3><span id="Shissah_Companions">Shissah Companions</span></h3>
<p>A shissah companion starts with slightly less <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor</a> than a typical horse, but it is easier to train; while it doesnât advance until 7th level (unlike a typical horse, which advances at 4th level), the superior boons it gains in the end often make the wait worthwhile.</p>

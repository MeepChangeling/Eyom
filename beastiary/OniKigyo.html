<h4><span id="Grasping_Eddy_Su">Grasping Eddy (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a kigyo can create a powerful underwater eddy that holds its enemies in place. The oni selects a grid intersection within 30 feet on or beneath the surface of a body of water as the center of the eddy. The oni can attempt an immediate <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check against any enemies within a 10-foot radius of this point, as though the targets were within its reach. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> in each subsequent round the eddy remains in place, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> can maintain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> on those targets caught within the eddyâs grasp (attempting a separate <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check for each target). In order to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pin</a> a target or deal damage with this effect, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> must take a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> as normal.</p>
<p>The eddy persists as long as the kigyo continues to take at least a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> on its turn to maintain a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>.</p>
<p>The effect immediately ends if all targets escape the eddy or if the kigyo does not spend any actions to use this ability, falls <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> or dies, or moves more than 30 feet from the eddyâs center. The kigyo can maintain only one grasping eddy at a time.</p>
<h4><span id="Trident_Mastery_Ex">Trident Mastery (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Kigyos are experts at employing tridents as deadly weapons. The oni gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus/">Weapon Focus</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/trident">trident</a>) as a bonus feat and treats a trident as having a range increment of 20 feet when underwater, even though throwing weapons underwater is normally ineffective for most combatants.</p>
<h4><span id="Underwater_Grappler_Ex">Underwater Grappler (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Kigyos are skilled grapplers and know how to use their underwater environs to their advantage when in close combat with their foes.</p>
<p>A kigyo gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> checks while it or its target is at least partially underwater. This bonus also applies to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> checks the kigyo attempts while using its grasping eddy ability. The kigyo gains no bonus to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> attempts.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any water<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or band (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (masterwork <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/trident">trident</a>)</p>
<p>While most oni are rare, those that take aquatic forms are scarcely ever encountered by terrestrial folk, though locathahs, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-merfolk">merfolk</a>, and other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> races are more likely to encounter these sea-dwelling <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> than they are to meet <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ogre">ogre</a> mages or other land-borne spirits. The most common submarine <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> is the kigyo, which adopts a form resembling a corrupted parody of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-merfolk">merfolk</a>.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-merfolk">merfolk</a>, kigyos have a torso and arms, with an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> lower body that allows them to maneuver lithely through the water. Unlike a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-merfolk">merfolk</a>, however, a kigyo has a monstrous face and its body more closely resembles that of a seahorse.</p>
<p>A typical kigyo is 7 feet long from its head to the tip of its curved tail and weighs 190 pounds.</p>
<p>As with many types of oni, kigyos are hateful, vengeful creatures that prey upon mortals not out of necessity but out of spite and malice. Kigyos enjoy seeing their victims drown, and they are said to be drawn to the sites of shipwrecks or tragic deaths at sea where mortals met their end in the unforgiving ocean. While this may not be true, plenty of kigyos have been the cause of such deaths, either in combat or by manipulating their victims into dangerous situations from which they could not escape. Kigyos have the ability to create powerful underwater currents that swirl in tight eddies, latching on to multiple creatures and holding them in place until they either drown or fall victim to the oniâs other attacks.</p>
<p>In the same way that a kigyo draws a sense of accomplishment from drowning a victim, it also feels a sense of superiority at making an enemy willingly give up something of incredible value in exchange for its life or that of a loved one. To oni, life and mortality are foreign concepts, and they can derive only so much pleasure out of seeing a living creatureâs essence snuffed out by death. As jealous and possessive beings, however, kigyos can more easily comprehend the sacrifice of giving up something other than oneâs life. Many kigyos develop obsessions with a single type of ransom they demand, such as firstborn children, spouses, a victimâs reproductive or sensory organs or lungs, or even (in rare cases) pure material wealth. Those who hunt kigyos or research kigyo activity across the world can sometimes follow a single oni from nation to nation and from ocean to ocean by the specifics of what it demands of its victims.</p>
<p>Thus have specific kigyos developed almost mythic status while victims across both distance and time suffer the same sadistic fate at the oniâs hands.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Kigyos rarely congregate with others of their kind, preferring instead solitary lives in the forms of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elves</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/gillman">gillman</a>, locathahs, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-merfolk">merfolk</a>, or other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> or shore-dwelling <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>. In these forms, kigyos attempt to seduce unsuspecting mortals, and trick them into bringing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a>âwho usually pretend to be castaways or injured victimsâonto their vessels or into their seaside communities. Once in these societies, kigyos bed unsuspecting mortals who take pity on them and then abscond with items of value while their partners are sleeping. After amassing particularly valuable or numerous prizes, a kigyo reveals itself to its victims and demands a ransom of something far more precious for the itemsâ return.</p>
<p>Like all oni, kigyos are filled with hatred, especially for their uncorrupted kami counterparts. Kigyos see suijins in particular as contemptible, and they are known to form elaborate hunting parties to seek out the benevolent nature spirits and destroy them and the untainted waters they protect. These raiding bands constitute the few large groups of kigyos, and they can present deadly threats to those who encounter them, be they kami or other creatures. The oni fight tactically in tandem, half of the kigyos using their grasping eddy abilities to hold their foes in place while the other half surround and stab at them with their tridents. Even when encountered alone, a kigyo presents a formidable challenge to even the most adept underwater fighters, as it can hold an entire party in one of its powerful whirlpools, reducing its foesâ ability to conduct their own group fighting tactics.</p>

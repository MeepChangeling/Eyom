<h4><a name="TOC-Hex-Prone-Su-"></a>Hex-Prone (Su)</h4>
<p>An almiraj takes a â2 penalty on all saving throws against harmful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch">witch</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch#TOC-Hex">hexes</a>. The duration of any beneficial <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch#TOC-Hex">hexes</a> longer than 1 round that affect an almiraj is increased by 50%.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Magic-Horn-Su-"></a>Magic Horn (Su)</h4>
<p>While on the creature’s head, an almiraj’s horn is treated as a +1 weapon. Any living creature slain by an almiraj’s gore attack immediately turns to stone (as if by the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/flesh-to-stone">flesh to stone</a> spell, with no saving throw, and the creature is still dead). A severed almiraj horn retains a wisp of its former magic, and counts as a masterwork weapon if used to create a magical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/dagger">dagger</a> or similar small piercing weapon.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate hills, plains, or forests<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental (magic horn)</p>
<p>Almirajes are fiercely territorial, although they flee if unable to fight on their terms, only to return later to defend their territory. They demonstrate their territorial claims to others of their kind with acrobatic displays and mock horn battles rather than fighting in earnest. Other intruders are met with aggressive posturing and warning calls, though almirajes prefer not to fight. If an interloper refuses to withdraw, however, the almiraj will fight to the death to defend its claim.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how almirajes reproduce, since females are rare and the creatures are always encountered alone. Records indicate that they live for 40 to 60 years and some communities are able to build respectful, if wary, relationships with them.</p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Familiar"></a>Familiar<br/></h3>
<p>Almirajes are particularly popular with witches as familiars. Spellcasters of any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/improved-familiar">Improved Familiar</a> feat can gain an almiraj as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-">familiar</a> at 5th level.</p>

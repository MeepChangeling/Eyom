<p><b>During Combat</b> Treasure golems spring into action as soon as a creature with 500 gp or more of goods on their person wanders within range of its treasure sense. They swallow the wealthiest target nearby, bludgeoning any other attackers (or creatures carrying gold or magic items) to death.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Treasure golems lack any sense of self-preservation and fight to the death.</p>

<h4><span id="Animating_Core_Ex">Animating Core (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Inside a treasure golem is a glowing magical core, crystalline in form and about 1 foot in diameter. If this core is destroyed the animation of the treasure golem ceases to function, effectively destroying the monster regardless of its remaining <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. Because this core is at the center of the treasure golem, it can normally only be attacked by creatures who have been swallowed whole (instead of attempting to free themselves). The core has AC 15, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 10, 25 hp.</p>
<h4><span id="Reducing_Size_Ex">Reducing Size (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As the treasure golem takes damage, bits of treasure break loose from it, reducing its size. When the Golem has less than 35 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> remaining, itâs ability scores change (see Modified Statistics under Tactics).</p>
<p>While the treasure golem is in this state its core becomes exposed, allowing the creature to be attacked directly.</p>
<p>The exposed core has total <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> (50% miss chance) and any targeted attack that misses because of this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> instead hits the treasure golem. When the treasure golemâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> are reduced below 20, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> provided to the core reduces to normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> (20% miss chance).</p>
<h4><span id="Treasure_Sense_Ex">Treasure Sense (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A treasure golem can sense bits of gold, silver, or copper within 50 ft. as though it had <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> (this is blocked by an inch-thick sheet of lead or 1 ft. or more of stone). Any creature carrying 500 gp or more of wealth wakes a dormant treasure golem as soon as they are within 10 feet of it.</p>
<p>Sometimes these beasts are the creation of an avaricious, hoarding spellcaster and at others the result of a treasure pile becoming suffused with the magical energies of items within.</p>
<p>Either way they are incredibly single-minded and have an intense focus on killing adversaries to acquire more wealth. Some say there are treasure golems the size of a small settlement, the creation of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragons</a> intent on killing unwary thieves.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> triple</p>
<p>Creating a treasure golem is a trying task best left to the initiated mage, as unprepared creators are often destroyed by the resulting creature as soon as it animates (instinctively seeking out the spellcasterâs magic items).</p>

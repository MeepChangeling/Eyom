<h4><a name="TOC-Eldritch-Blast-Su-"></a>Eldritch Blast (Su)</h4>
<p>The herald chooses an additional effect for its eldritch blasts each round (DC 26 negates). A creature that fails its saves against both blasts in the same round suffers an increased effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<li><b>Ignite (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a>)</b>: The creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage. <i>Increased effect</i>: The creature catches on fire.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="TOC-Energy-Channel-Aura-Su-"></a>Energy Channel Aura (Su)</h4>
<p>On its turn, the herald can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-">channel energy</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 26 half) to deal 2d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Acid">acid</a>, cold, electricity, or fire damage to each creature in its aura. A creature struck by its incorporeal touch attack also takes this damage (no saving throw). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Ecology2"></a>Ecology</h4>
<p>The Arcanotheign understands she is foreign to mortal life and mortal needs. She enjoys experiencing new aromas and tastes; someone wishing to get on her good side should bring her strongly scented flowers, a tasty meal, or some other physical object that may be new to her experience, even if humans would think it stinks or is inedible. She is interested in animals, and if she spends much time in the same place, she may âadoptâ those living near her, especially orphaned ones. Some in the church suspect that her attention can cause mutations in these creatures, either directly or in its offspring, creating strange hybrids or magical creatures. The Arcanotheign has a lesser interest in children, though if a lost child finds its way to her, she is more likely to protect it or return it home than to ignore or harm it. Some of these children develop sorcerous power, typically with the arcane or destined bloodline.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society2"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> creature created in a moment of lucidity by an insane, omniscient god, the Arcanotheign is often left to her own devices when her master does not need her, and wanders the planes searching for new sensations and meaning to her existence and that of the multiverse. She is a lonely creature and welcomes those who would speak to her as part of a normal conversation rather than an attempt to get information from her.</p>
<p>Her affection for animals is related to this; they are simple creatures who make no demands of her, and her habit of animating giant bears, lions, and other animals out of earth, stone, or wood represents her respect for animals she has known in the past ages.</p>

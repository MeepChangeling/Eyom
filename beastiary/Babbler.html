<h1>Babbler</h1>
<p class="description">This creature stands taller than a human and appears as a cross between a lizardman and gorgosaurus. Its reptilian body is covered in yellow scales and its underbelly is gray. Strange symbols and patterns of grayish-brown can be seen on its back.</p>

<p>Babblers have a large, strong tail that keeps them balanced when they stand on their hind legs (particularly during combat). Most of their time is spent slithering on their stomach in search of prey. The babbler is a carnivore and is quite fond of human, elven, and dwarven flesh.</p>
<p>A babbler stands about 8 feet tall and weighs around 700 pounds. A babbler attempts to ambush its opponents by slithering within range and then rearing on its hind legs and attacking. In combat, it slashes with its claws and snaps with its vicious bite.</p>

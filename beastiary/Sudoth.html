<h1>Sudoth</h1>
<p class="description">This vaguely humanoid creature has a head that resembles a large jelly fish. Extending down from its large head is a manlike torso and arms that again change into a long knot of feathery writhing tentacles which it uses as a means of propulsion beneath the waves. Its lower torso is a mass of writhing and twitching tentacles. </p>

<p>Hunters by nature, sudoth are often encountered while on a hunting excursion.</p>
<p>A common tactic is to grapple and paralyze a foe with its tail tentacles, and finish them off with stabs from their spear. Their tail tentacles excrete a paralytic substance. </p>

<p>Sudoth are a curious species thought to be the offspring of sailors stranded in windless seas and some cursed horror of the deep. For this reason they are often attacked by mariners on sight. In truth, the sudoth are a peaceable if dangerous species that trade freely between locathah, sahaugin, and occasionally sea elves and merfolk. Their pliable flesh proves immune to the pressures of deep waters, allowing them to salvage riches from the depths that even other races of the seas find impossible to retrieve. They are enemies of krakens and aboleth who find them a delicious tasting delicacy.</p>
<p>Sudoths make their lairs deep under the oceans and sustain themselves on a diet of small fish and plant life.</p>
<p>The fleshy parts of this creature vary in color from a milky white transparent color to a deep, rich bluish-green. Its tentacles range in color from gray to dark blue and vary in size with the sudoth (the larger specimenâ€™s tentacles reach lengths of 10 feet or more). A small almost unnoticeable band of eyes (the same color as its flesh) ring the circumference of its head.</p>
<p>Its malleable form protects it against most bludgeoning attacks; thus opponents are advised to employ piercing or slashing weapons when combating a sudoth.</p>

<h1>Draconid</h1>
<p class="description">This hideous creature looks like a cross between a giant spider and dragon or hydra. Where its head should be, two long serpentine necks sprout from its body. Its head and neck are scaled gray, and its spidery torso and eight knobbed legs are covered in short, coarse fur.</p>

<p>Draconids are a hideous cross between either a giant spider and a hydra or a giant spider and a dragon. They dwell deep underground where they dine on the flesh of elves, dwarves, goblins, and just about anything else that crosses their path. These creatures are never encountered on the surface world, preferring to spend their lives underground.</p>
<p>Draconids are solitary creatures and never mix with others of their own kind (except for mating purposes). If a draconid moves into anotherâs territory, a fight almost always ensues as soon as they discover one another. A typical draconid hunting ground covers an area of nearly 10 miles from its lair.</p>
<p>When not hunting, a draconid spends its time in its lair. A draconidâs lair is something most disgusting and quite memorable to those that stumble across it. A tangled mess of shiny coins and gems mixed with corpses, bones, and rotted flesh.</p>

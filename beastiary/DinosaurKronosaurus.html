<p> Primeval Sea Creatures 
<p>The ocean is full of myriad life forms, as varied and specialized as those in any other environment. But not all sea creatures are the result of millennia upon millennia of continual evolution. Some found themselves perfectly suited for their roles as apex predators millions of years ago and have simply remained as such to the present day, presenting terrible threats to those creatures that cross them, from their natural prey to unsuspecting sailors who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. In most cases, these creatures are closely related to other waterborne animals, be they fish, reptiles, or mammals, and some even have distinctive similarities to primarily land-based creatures.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm oceans<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or school (3â8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The mighty kronosaurus is a relentless hunter that, once it picks up a potential meal’s scent, rarely stops seeking its prey until its appetite is sated. A kronosaurus’s diet consists of everything from large fish and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/shark/shark">sharks</a> to small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/whale">whales</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/squid/giant-squid">giant squids</a>, and sea <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/turtle">turtles</a>. Remains of other giant saurians have reportedly been found in the stomachs of those rare kronosauruses that are killed by hunters or wash up dead on shore. Unlike other reptiles, a kronosaurus does not lay eggs, but instead births its young live. The young kronosauruses stay with their mother for less than a year before parting ways and hunting on their own. A fully grown kronosaurus can reach lengths of up to 50 feet and weigh as much as 40,000 pounds.</p>

<p class="description">Odors reach your nose that are so foul they defy description as a blur zips by overhead and a large, goat-headed monster suddenly towers over you, standing atop the shadow you cast on a nearby wall as if it were as solid as the ground.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Sigbin hide in the darkness far enough away from prey, using their invisibility ability and keeping enough of a distance that their stench aura is not detected. A sigbin waits for a creature to be alone before attacking.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Springing from the darkness, a sigbin first attempts to use its poison spine to cause unconsciousness and then uses its shadow pounce in case the victim wakes up. If faced with a large number of foes, a sigbin uses its invisibility and flees.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Sigbin flee when reduced to 20 hp or less.</p>

<h4><span id="Betwixt_and_Between_Su">Betwixt and Between (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A sigbin is made up of the slightest bit of shadow stuff, allowing it to treat shadows as solid. The sigbin still affects the real world as usual and this grants no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> benefits nor does it grant the sigbin the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ghost-touch" style="font-style: italic">ghost touch</a> ability for any of its attacks, but it does gain +1d8 negative energy to its bite attack and +1d4 negative energy to its slam attacks.</p>
<h4><span id="Invisibility_Su">Invisibility (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A sigbin can make itself <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> as per the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility">invisibility</a> spell. Due to its centuries of hunting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>, the sigbinâs <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility">invisibility</a> is particularly effective against creatures with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> type, increasing the DC of any skill checks made to detect the sigbin by +5. This ability does not negate the sigbinâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Stench-Ex-">stench</a> aura.</p>
<h4><span id="Shadow_Pin_Su">Shadow Pin (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When the sigbin pounces on a creatureâs shadow it can attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> the creature without incurring an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. A creature with its shadow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> by a sigpin gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> condition and cannot move. When using shadow pin against a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a> creature, sigbin gain a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> to their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus">CMB</a> check. Creatures <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> by shadow pin can escape with a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> check or a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check against the sigbinâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> (a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>).</p>
<h4><span id="Shadow_Rend_Su">Shadow Rend (Su)</span></h4>
<p>If the sigbin begins a round with a creatureâs shadow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> (pinning the creature with shadow pin), it can take a bite of that shadow that deals 2d6+4 points of damage and 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> to the creature. For every point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> dealt the sigbin gains 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>. The shadow of a creature affected by shadow rend loses a number of pieces equal to the amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> dealt to the creature; this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> can only be healed naturally (not by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal">heal</a>, lesser <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">restoration</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">restoration</a>, or any other magic that heals <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">ability damage</a>). Only corporeal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast">magical beasts</a> that cast shadows can be affected by shadow rend.</p>

<h4><span id="Spines_Ex">Spines (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Four times per day, a sigbin can whip its tail in an arc that sends a long, thin spine at a single target within 40 feet. The spine deals 1d6 piercing damage plus sigbin sleep <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> and regrows after 1d4 rounds.</p>

<p>Where or how sigbin (also known as zegben or shadow drinkers) originated remains a mystery but there are two prevailing theories.</p>
<p>The less popular belief is that at some time in the past, a creature from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Shadow-Plane">Plane of Shadow</a> bred with a large blood-drinking creature, creating a lineage of these vampiric monsters. More commonly, tales of sigbin tell of a shadow mage purposefully creating the beasts, but didnât count on them breeding true; apparently they did, creating an entirely new population. The truth, as it usually is, is more terrifying.</p>
<p>Under the right circumstances a vampireâs shadow, stripped from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undeadâs</a> mortal form and flung into the universe, takes on a life of its own as a sigbin. No longer linked to a soul, it remembers nothing of its previous life, and the only remnants of its former host that a shadow carries is the vampireâs unquenchable thirst for blood. A sigbin spends its life searching for the being that it once belonged to, but is uncertain what would the result would be if this ever came to pass. Otherwise sigbin are predators that seek out the living for their sustenance in a way similar to their vampire parents.</p>
<p>Sigbin are 15 ft. long and weigh about 400 pounds. They have dark gray fur covering their bodies, large bat-like wings, short arms, and long legs that end in curved claws. Their faces resemble that of a demonic, hornless goat, with a mouth full of sharp, redstained teeth. From their back sprouts a long, serpentine tail tipped with a poisonous spike.</p>

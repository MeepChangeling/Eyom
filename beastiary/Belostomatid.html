<h4><span id="Digestive_Enzymes_Ex"><a name="TOC-Digestive-Enzymes-Ex-"></a>Digestive Enzymes (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A belostomatid injects a corrosive enzyme into its prey that both paralyzes and liquefies flesh. A creature struck by the belostomatidâs piercing bite must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> for 1d4 rounds. For every round the creature is paralyzed it takes 1d2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Hold_Breath_Ex"><a name="TOC-Hold-Breath-Ex-"></a>Hold Breath (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A belostomatid can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> score before it risks drowning.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate lakes, rivers, or swamps<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The belostomatid is the monstrous form of its diminutive counterpart, a 5-inch-long âgiantâ water bug commonly known as a âtoe-biter.â A monstrous belostomatid has a flattened, oval-shaped body measuring 12 feet long, and four rear, oarlike legs, which it uses to thrust through the water. The belostomatidâs front two legs are thick and end in sharp, single-tipped claws, which it uses to slay its prey. Two large black eyes are mounted on each side of the creatureâs rostrum, and it uses its 2-foot-long, beaklike proboscis to inject its deadly acidic enzymes into its victims.</p>
<p>Belostomatids are ambush predators. They hide amid floating snags and piles of debris in still and slow-moving waters, seamlessly blending in with their surroundings despite their size. With a powerful surge forward, a belostomatid grabs its prey, thrusts its rostrum deep into the preyâs body, and begins pumping a paralyzing digestive enzyme into its prey, dissolving it from the inside out.</p>

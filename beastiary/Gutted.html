<p>Any creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> by a gutted is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for as long as they remain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> and for one round afterward, unless they succeed at a DC 13 <b>Fort</b> Save.</p>
<h4><span id="Squeeze_Ex">Squeeze (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gutted can dissolve itself into a mass of squirming intestines, and pass through openings as small as 1-2 inches in diameter. It is considered flatfooted while squeezing.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any urban or ruins<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>An especially viscous killer or heretic executed by disembowelment might claw their way back from Hell as a Gutted. These horrid souls, minds and souls broken beyond repair by the sheer messy horror of their end possess their own spilled guts. Over several stinking, flatulent hours, the intestines replicate themselves over and over, knotting themselves into the rough approximation of a manâs form.</p>
<p>Gutted exist only to kill, and give a dim preference to their torturers over all others, but eventually massacre any lifeform they encounter. Gutted lurk in middens and sewers, where their fecal, coppery stench is not noticed as easily.</p>

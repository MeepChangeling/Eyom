<h4><a name="TOC-Grab-and-Bite-Ex-"></a>Grab and Bite (Ex)</h4>
<p>A plantoid servitor that succeeds on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check can make a bite attack against its opponent as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>. This attack uses the plantoid servitor’s full <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus">attack bonus</a> and deals 1d3+2 damage.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Poison-Ex-"></a>Poison (Ex)</h4>
<p><b>Transformative Poison</b>: Biteâinjury; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 13; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 4 rounds; <i>effect</i> special; <i>cure</i> 1 save.</p>
<p>On the first failed save, the victim is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> for 1d6 rounds. On the second failed saving throw, moss rapidly grows on all skin surfaces. The victim gets a +2 bonus on the third saving throw, but if the third save fails the victim becomes a plantoid servitor under the control of the nearest plantoid. There is a 25% chance that the victim becomes a new plantoid in a hideous transformation that takes 24 hours. If the victim succeeds on his third saving throw, the moss that grew on him withers and dies and falls away within a few minutes.</p>
<p>The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>

<p>Plantoid servitors are humans (and their ilk) who have fallen prey to a plantoid. It is possible for a plantoid servitor to operate independently of a plantoid, in which case the eyes will not glow. Plantoid servitors acting independently from one of the plantoid masters are capable of following only the simplest of instructions, such as âattack anyone entering this room,â and the plantoid is not able to give further instructions until it can once again gain physical contact with the plantoid servitor.</p>
<p>Plantoid servitors drop any held equipment when they are first dominated, but retain any worn gear such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, backpacks, capes, rings, and so on. At the GM’s discretion, a plantoid servitor may still be wearingâand gaining the full benefit ofâany special worn gear or magic items it possessed in its previous life.</p>

<p>The result of an unfortunate union between an ogre and a humanoid, the ogrekin (or half-ogre) is cursed with horrific malformations due to its tragic ancestry. Shunned by both parents, ogrekin tend to form unstable clans of their own, often resorting to inbreeding to sustain the collective. While good-natured ogrekin are not entirely unheard of, they are far and few between.</p>
<h3><span id="Ogrekin_Encounters">Ogrekin Encounters</span></h3>
<p>Ogrekin are solitary creatures and rarely live in groups of more than six. While not particularly intelligent, ogrekin can plan simple ambushes and tactics but quickly fall back on the savagery of their monstrous parents, aggressively attacking the most physically imposing enemies first and using their deformities and great strength to terrible effect at close range. At their most merciful, ogrekin prefer to take living captives that they treat with widely varied levels of hospitality. Ogrekin are rarely encountered in settlements, though they often prowl close to a town’s fence or city’s gate, waiting for unsuspecting travelers. This lonely existence leads many ogrekin to tame and train wild animals, a practice ogrekin take to with ease by quickly establishing dominance over beasts with their prodigious physical strength. These pets form resilient bonds with their masters and remain fiercely protective even after their owners’ death.</p>

<h1>Soul Reaper</h1>
<p class="description">This sinister figure appears shrouded in a long, black hooded robe. Its face is hidden from view and its long wickedly-curved claws are deathly black in color. It grips a gleaming, silver-bladed scythe in its claws. </p>

<p>Soul reapers are vile undead with a fierce hatred for the living. They exist only to kill, and take great pleasure in slaying any living creature they encounter. They kill without guilt, without feeling or remorse, and without emotion; drinking the soul of their victim to insure it never returns to life.</p>
<p>Soul reapers have no ties to the land of the living, in that they have always existed and have always been. Their origins are unknown, but speculation says they stepped from the great void at the beginning of creation. It is thought that only six or seven of these creatures exist (and most living beings are thankful of that).</p>
<p>Soul reapers are 12-foot tall humanoid creatures shrouded in long, black hooded cloaks. Though they are corporeal creatures, their form is either shrouded in utter darkness or formed of the stuff of shadows. No discernible facial features are visible under the hood. The creature’s hands end in wicked claws of inky blackness that are always clutched tightly around its gleaming, sharp scythe. These creatures never speak and no one knows if they even can (and if they could, what would one say to a soul reaper?)</p>
<p>Soul reapers haunt civilized lands searching for the next victim who will fall prey to the deadly scythe and its soul-draining powers. When it encounters a living creature, the soul reaper casts <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/u/unholy-aura">unholy aura</a> on itself. It then pinpoints an enemy spellcaster and uses its deafness ability, or selects the most powerful foe (its best guess) and hits it with blindness. Invisible opponents are no match for the soul reaper and it often targets them first, just to show them that they cannot hide from its deadly blade.</p>
<p>When it closes to melee, the soul reaper uses a full attack with its scythe against its closest opponent.</p>

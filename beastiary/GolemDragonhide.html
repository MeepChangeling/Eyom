<h4><span id="Berserk_Ex">Berserk (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a dragonhide golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 2% chance each round that the lingering primal presence in its draconic grafts overwhelms the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a>, causing it to go berserk. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> to reset the golemâs berserk chance to 0%; alternatively, the creator can offer the golem a tribute of coins and gems in an attempt to calm the lingering draconic presence. For every 500 gp offered in tribute, the golemâs berserk chance is lowered by 1%. Once berserk, the uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction.</p>
<p>The golemâs creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, requiring a successful DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> check.</p>
<h4><span id="Breath_Weapon_Su">Breath Weapon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A dragonhide golemâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> depends on the type of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a> whose head was grafted onto the creature, as summarized on the table below.</p>
<p>Regardless of type, a dragonhide golemâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> deals 20d6 points of damage and is usable once every 1d4 rounds. A target that succeeds at a DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save takes half damage. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based and includes a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>.</p>
<p>To determine a dragonhide golemâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.</p>

<h3><span id="Draconic_Grafts">Draconic Grafts</span></h3>
<p>Dragonhide golems have several draconic grafts upon their giant bodies to enhance their abilities and defenses. Most dragonhide golems have three draconic grafts; however, the creator can add any number of additional grafts, with each additional graft beyond the third increasing the cost of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> by 15,000 gp. For every two additional grafts beyond the third, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> CR increases by 1. Unless otherwise noted, each draconic graft can be selected only once. Draconic grafts are chosen from those presented below.</p>
<h4><span id="Dragonlike_Senses_Ex">Dragonlike Senses (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The dragonhide golem has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision">darkvision</a> out to 120 feet and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsense</a> out to 60 feet. It can see four times as well as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> in dim light and twice as well in normal light, and it receives a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks equal to 5 + the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. This replaces the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> standard <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision">darkvision</a> of 60 feet and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision">low-light vision</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Elemental_Aura_Su">Elemental Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The dragonhide golemâs body is surrounded by an aura of acid, cold, electricity, or fire, dealing 2d6 points of energy damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the golem at the start of its turn. The type of energy damage must be the same as one of the golemâs breath weapons. This aura can be activated or dismissed as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> has more than one type of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>, it can select the energy type each round.</p>
<h4><span id="Full-Body_Scales_Ex">Full-Body Scales (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The dragonhide golemâs body is fully encased in a thick layer of dragon scales, increasing its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a> by 2 and granting it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to a single type of energy (and possibly a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> as well), as determined by the type of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a> the scales are taken from. Silver or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/chromatic-white">white dragons</a> grant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to cold, but also <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> to fire. Blue or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/metallic-bronze">bronze dragons</a> grant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to electricity. Brass, gold, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/chromatic-red">red dragons</a> grant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to fire, but also <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> to cold. If a dragonhide golem is immune to cold and fire, it loses <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> to cold and fire. This draconic graft can be selected any number of times. Each time this draconic graft is selected, it gains an additional +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a> and an additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Immunity-and-Vulnerability">energy immunity</a> (and possibly a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> as well).</p>
<h4><span id="Graft_Head_Su">Graft Head (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The dragonhide golemâs head is formed from one additional type of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a>. Each time this draconic graft is selected, it gains a different type of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>, although the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> is still usable only once every 1d4 rounds. This draconic graft can be selected any number of times.</p>
<h4><span id="Powerful_Tail_Ex">Powerful Tail (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The dragonhide golem gains a tail attack usable as a secondary attack. It deals 1â1/2 times its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier on damage rolls with its tail attack.</p>
<h4><span id="Wings_Ex">Wings (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A pair of dragon wings are grafted onto the golemâs back, granting a fly speed of 100 feet with clumsy maneuverability. This draconic graft can be selected up to four times. Each additional time this draconic graft is selected, it improves the golemâs fly speed by 50 feet and its maneuverability by one step, to a maximum fly speed of 250 feet with good maneuverability.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A dragonhide golem is immune to any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> that allows <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against this creature, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/flesh-to-stone">flesh to stone</a> spell slows a dragonhide golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/rage">rage</a> spell increases a dragonhide golemâs chance to go berserk by 50%, with no saving throw.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Rampage_Su">Rampage (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever a dragonhide golem goes berserk, its draconic grafts are temporarily empowered. It gains a +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>, a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>, and a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor</a>. This effect ends when the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> berserk chance is reset to 0%.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or gang (2â4)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A dragonhide golem is a terrifying <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> monstrosity created from the body of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant">giant</a> with all manner of parts from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a> corpses grafted onto it.</p>
<h3><span id="Construction">Construction</span></h3>
<p>A dragonhide golemâs body is often built from the corpse of a Huge <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant">giant</a>. The draconic grafts are harvested from the bodies of one or more dragons, depending on the dragonâs size and the number of grafts to be used. Typically, the process requires no less than one dragon of Huge size, two of Large size, or four of Medium size. Special unguents made from dragonâs blood and magical bindings worth 9,000 gp are also required for the grafting process.</p>

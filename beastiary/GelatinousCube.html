<h1>Gelatinous Cube</h1>
<p class="description">Bits of broken weapons, coins, and a partially digested skeleton are visible inside this quivering cube of slime.</p>

<h4><span id="Acid_Ex">Acid (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gelatinous cube’s acid does not harm metal or stone.</p>
<h4><span id="Engulf_Ex">Engulf (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can simply engulf Large or smaller creatures in its path as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The gelatinous cube merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 12 Reflex save to avoid being engulfedâon a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent’s choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube’s paralysis and acid, gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, and are trapped within its body until they are no longer pinned. The save DC is Strength-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Paralysis_Ex">Paralysis (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gelatinous cube secretes an anesthetizing slime. A target hit by a cube’s melee or engulf attack must succeed on a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Transparent_Ex">Transparent (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Due to its lack of coloration, a gelatinous cube is difficult to discern. A DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception" rel="nofollow">Perception</a> check is required to notice a motionless gelatinous cube. Any creature that fails to notice a gelatinous cube and walks into it is automatically engulfed.</p>
<p><b>Environment any</b> underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>One of the dungeon’s most unusual and specialized predators, gelatinous cubes spend their existence mindlessly roaming dungeon halls and dark caverns, swallowing up organic material such as plants, refuse, carrion, and even living creatures. Materials the cube cannot digest, such as metal and stone, can eventually fill up the creature’s mass with such detritus, and at times the creature may excrete some of this material out of its body. Often the treasure and possessions of past victims remain inside the gelatinous cube, leaving a ghostly impression of their material remains.</p>
<p>Sages believe these creatures evolved as a specialized advancement of gray oozes. Some beings use gelatinous cubes as protectors of dungeons and underground fortifications, trapping the immense creatures in massive metal crates and transporting them through either slave power or magic to their final guard posts. They make particularly efficient waste disposal mechanisms as wellâa tribe that can trap a gelatinous cube in a pit or other area that it cannot climb out of can use it as a midden or even a deadly trap, depending only on the ingenuity of the creatures who caught it.</p>

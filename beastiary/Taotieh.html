<p>A taotieh can expand its jaws to swallow Large or smaller creatures. When swallowed, a victim is transported to its own lightless pocket dimensionâa stone prison just large enough to contain the victim. Creatures do not take damage within this pocket dimension, but there is only enough air inside to last for 3 rounds. At the end of the third round, the trapped creature must hold its breath or risk <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Suffocation">suffocation</a>. A creature that attempts to carve its way out of this dimension with a weapon must be able to penetrate the surrounding walls’ <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 8. When a creature manages to cut its way out of this dimension, it appears to leap out of the taotieh’s mouth to emerge into any square adjacent to the taotieh’s spaceâno actual hole is created in the creature, and new creatures that are swallowed later must cut their own way out. When a taotieh is destroyed, its body bursts open to allow the contents of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> stomachs to spill out into adjacent spaces. A taotieh can swallow up to four creatures at any one time.</p>

<p>Symbols of power but also of gluttony, taotiehs are guardian <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> formed of stone and built around a pocket of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> space. Taotiehs are used to ward sacred or secluded areas from enemies and trespassers. Their semblance to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cat-great/tiger">tigers</a> extends even to the animal’s abilities in combat, as taotiehs are feared for their vicious attacks. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> space at the core of a taotieh allows the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> to swallow opponents of its own size and then shunt its victims into an airless pocket of space inside. A creature capable of existing without air could well spend an eternity inside a taotieh if it couldn’t smash its way out or escape via plane-traversing magic, in which case it must wait for outside forces to slay its captor. Tales abound of great treasures and even greater dangers being unleashed upon a taotieh’s destruction.</p>

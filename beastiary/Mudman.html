<h1>Mudman</h1>
<p class="description">This stocky humanoid is seemingly composed of mud. It has long, thick arms and bandy legs. Its head is round and featureless.</p>

<p>When a living creature enters a mud pool, the mudman forms its humanoid shape (as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>) and attacks until the opponent is slain or leaves the mud pool. A mudman attacks by pummeling a foe with its fists or by hurling globs of mud. Mudmen are bound to the pool where they are formed or where they enter the Material Plane and cannot leave their mud pool.</p>

<h4><span id="Engulf_Su"><a name="TOC-Engulf-Su-"></a>Engulf (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per minute as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a mudman can hurl itself at any creature of its size or smaller within 10 feet. If it succeeds on a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, the mudman immediately makes a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus">CMB</a> check to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> the target (this does not provoke an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>) with a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>. If the mudman fails to establish a hold, it drops into an adjacent square and is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round. If the mudman establishes a hold, it flows over its opponent, covering the creature with its muddy bodyâit can attempt a new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus">CMB</a> check to maintain the âholdâ on the creature each round that follows as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. The creature is effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> and must either hold its breath or suffocate as long as the mudman retains its hold. Each round the mudman maintains its hold, it deals 1d4+3 points of damage as it crushes and constricts its victims.</p>
<h4><span id="Magic_Vulnerability_Ex"><a name="TOC-Magic-Vulnerability-Ex-"></a>Magic Vulnerability (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Mudmen are particularly susceptible to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic"><i>dispel magic</i></a>, as this spell disrupts the magical energies in their bodies. A mudman subjected to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic"><i>dispel magic</i></a> takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save for half damage). Transmute mud to rock deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any mudmen caught in the area of effect and leaves them <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> until they can find a new mud pool. Other, similar spells may have similar effects.</p>
<h4><span id="Mud_Bomb_Su"><a name="TOC-Mud-Bomb-Su-"></a>Mud Bomb (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A mudman can hurl globs of its muddy body mixed with its surrounding mudâthis attack has a range increment of 10 feet. If one of these mud bombs hits a target, it quickly grows semi-solid and tenacious, causing 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> damage. If the cumulative <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> damage from mud bombs ever equals the targetâs actual <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> score, the target remains conscious but is held immobile and cannot take any physical action (although see below) until the mud is removed or the target breaks free. Spell-like abilities or spells with only verbal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a> may be used if the trapped creature can make a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a> check. Itâs a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> check (made as a full-round action) to pry accumulated mud off and remove all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> damage caused by the attackâa creature that is held immobile can break free with a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> check made as a full-round action (this is the only physical action the creature can attempt while encased in mud). The mud dries and crumbles to dust in 15 minutes, or in 1d3 rounds if a large amount of water (such as results from a casting of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-water"><i>create water</i></a>) is used to wash it away.</p>
<h4><span id="Mud_Pool_Su"><a name="TOC-Mud-Pool-Su-"></a>Mud Pool (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A mudman cannot leave the bounds of the mud pool it dwells in, although these mud pools may be of any size. A mudmanâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Tremorsense-Ex-"><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Tremorsense">tremorsense</a></a> extends throughout the entire mud pool, and it gains a +16 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks when hiding in a mud pool. A mudman forced out of its mud pool is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> Para-Elemental Plane of Mud<br/> <b>Organization</b> Solitary, gang (3-6), or pack (7-12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>Their natural form is that of a pool of mud about 5 feet in diameter. In this form, they cannot be discerned from normal mud. Mud pools are formed where the Elemental Plane of Earth and the Elemental Plane of Water commingle in the multiverse, and thus mudmen are born. Occasionally, a vortex opens to a region on the Material Plane where magical waters have stagnated against the land, thereby forming a mud pool. Mudmen pass through this vortex to the Material Plane. Though not evil, mudmen look with disdain on any who trespass in their mud pools.</p>

<h1>Hamster, Giant</h1>
<p class="description">What should be a tiny, cuddly creature is instead a behemoth of tan fur and over-sized teeth. Its eyes gleam with a feral intensity.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Cheek-Pouch-Ex-"></a>Cheek Pouch (Ex)</h4>
<p>A giant hamster can try to stuff a grabbed opponent of two sizes smaller than itself into its cheek pouch by making a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. A creature stuffed into the giant hamsterâs cheek pouch takes no damage, and can escape by making a successful DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> check or can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 10 points of damage to the cheek (AC 11). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another trapped opponent must cut its own way out. A Large hamsterâs cheek can hold 1 Small, 2 Tiny, or 8 Diminutive or smaller opponents. The check DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>-based.</p>

<p>Giant hamsters are larger, slightly more aggressive relatives of the normal hamster. Like their smaller cousins, they come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. Giant hamsters are omnivorous, but prefer to feast on a diet of grains, berries, nuts, and water. On occasion, they indulge in and eat meat, usually insects and the like. Also like its smaller cousin, the giant hamster can store food in its cheek pouches. The average giant hamster can store about 200 pounds of food at any given time.</p>
<p>Giant hamsters normally shun combat, but if cornered or extremely hungry they may attack. Note that even domesticated giant hamsters attack if their young are threatened. The giant hamster attacks by biting with its long, sharp teeth.</p>

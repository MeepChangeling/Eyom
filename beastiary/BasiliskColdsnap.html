<h1>Basilisk, Coldsnap</h1>
<p class="title">Coldsnap Basilisk <span class="level">CR 6</span></p>
<p class="description">Six stocky legs sprout from this scaled purple creature as it cautiously stalks forward, its cold blue eyes alert for danger and a vapor of chilled air coming from out of its mouth.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Coldsnap basilisks are fearless and walk directly up to prey.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> A coldsnap basilisk uses its freezing gaze to paralyze opponents, attacking enemies that arenât turned into ice.</p>

<h4>Freezing Gaze (Ex)</h4>
<p>Creatures within 30 ft. that meet a coldsnap basiliskâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> make a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or turn into ice for one hour; at the end of this hour, a creature turned to ice makes a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or becomes permanently frozen. Creatures immune to cold damage are immune to a coldsnap basiliskâs freezing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a>. The only way to restore a permanently frozen creature is with a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle">miracle</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a>, though after the coldsnap basilisk responsible has died, and creatures it has permanently frozen thaw out after one week.</p>
<p>The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>Coldsnap basilisks are the offshoot of their petrifying cousins, stalking the coldest climates in constant search for warm prey to eat. Itâs widely believed that these chilling beasts are descendants of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/basilisk">basilisks</a> taken to or from a dimension consumed by cold, though the oldest records of their existence date back thousands of years and some believe they may have been bred by jotunn. Frost drakes and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/chromatic-white">white dragons</a> frequently lair near these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast">magical beasts</a>, treating them not unlike guard dogs.</p>
<p>A coldsnap basilisk is about 5 feet long and weighs between 200 and 250 pounds.</p>

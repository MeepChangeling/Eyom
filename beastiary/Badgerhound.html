<p>The badgerhound is a short-legged, long, slender canine. It was first bred centuries ago by farmers who had problems with badgers digging up their fields. The dogâs short legs and long, slender body allow it to follow its prey into the holes the badgers dig and drag them out. In addition to badgers, these dogs are often used to hunt marmots and otters. </p>
<p>Badgers will frequently dig away from a badgerhound, throwing dirt up into the dogâs path to try and block it. To overcome this obstacle, the badgerhounds learned to dig rapidly themselves and can move through loose soil at a rate comparable to their prey. Badgerhounds cannot <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> through rubble, rock or solid stone, however.</p>
<p>Several centuries after they were first bred, the badgerhound is quite popular as a pet. Many that keep them as pets are unaware of their nature as a hunting dog.</p>
<p><b>Carrying Capacity</b>: A light load for a badgerhound is up to 22 pounds; a medium load, 23-45 pounds; a heavy load, 46-67 pounds. A Badgerhound can drag 335 pounds.</p>
<p><b>Average Price</b>: 15 gp</p>

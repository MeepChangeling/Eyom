<h4><span id="Electrified_Ex"><a name="TOC-Electrified-Ex-"></a>Electrified (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A creature that strikes a capacitor ooze with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapon</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a>, or metal weapon takes 4d6 points of electricity damage. Creatures <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> a capacitor ooze take this damage when initiating the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> and on each round the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> is maintained.</p>
<h4><span id="Neurophagic_Jolt_Ex"><a name="TOC-Neurophagic-Jolt-Ex-"></a>Neurophagic Jolt (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a capacitor <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> deals electricity damage to a target with its slam attack, the jolt to the target’s neurological system stuns the creature for 1 round (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> DC 25 negates). A second neurophagic jolt to a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> target sets up a destructive resonance in the target’s brain. This resonance functions like an affliction with the following statistics: save <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> and 1d2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Intelligence damage</a>; cure 1 save. <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison">Neutralize poison</a> does not cure this affliction, but <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal">heal</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">greater restoration</a>, and any effect that removes insanity does. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Osmotic_Drain_Ex"><a name="TOC-Osmotic-Drain-Ex-"></a>Osmotic Drain (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A capacitor ooze drains power from nearby electrical sources. Any creatures within 10 feet of a capacitor <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> carrying at least one device that’s powered by or generates electricity must succeed at a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or lose 1 charge from a random electrical device. Single-use items are depowered entirely; devices with renewable electrical sources are depowered until they can recharge (in the case of a solar-powered device) or have their electrical function suppressed for 1d4 minutes (in the case of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shock">shock</a> weapon). A given power source can be drained only once per minute. For each electrical device affected by the capacitor <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze’s</a> osmotic drain, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage the next time it would deal electricity damage to a target, and its speed increases by 30 feet for 1 round. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold deserts or plains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Created by technologists seeking to devise an organic battery, capacitor oozes escaped captivity and now infest the hinterlands. They find water dangerous and humidity painful, so they gravitate toward arid climes with stable weather.</p>
<p>Capacitor oozes instinctively seek out sources of electricity, consuming them like other creatures would food. Maintaining vigor and growth requires regular consumption of organic material as well. A capacitor ooze that’s denied power or food begins to starve.</p>
<p>Capacitor oozes grow without bound, splitting only from damage or misfortune. Capacitor oozes that encounter others of their kind often merge if left undisturbed, a process that takes 1d4 hours and may result in a giant or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/advanced-creature-cr-1">advanced</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a>. Capacitor oozes that aren’t inclined to merge disperse, as they find disharmonious electrical auras intolerable.</p>

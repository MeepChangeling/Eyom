<h1>Drowned Maiden</h1>
<p class="description">Surrounded by eerie silence, the frail woman whose visage was that of inconsolable sorrow only moments before, now glowers in rage. Her luxurious hair snaking through the water towards its victim.</p>

<p>If a drowned maiden successfully pins an opponent up to Large size that her tresses have successfully <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a>, she can embrace it to deadly effect. On each round that the drowned maiden embraces a creature in this manner, she kisses it.

<p>At will, a drowned maiden can cause her hair to extend or retract with great speed. Her hair is prehensile and capable of making attacks as a primary attack (break DC 25; AC 17, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> 15; 10 hp; DR 15/slashing). On a successful attack, the tresses grab a target, which the maiden then pulls into her embrace. Her hair can only <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> one target at a time, and during that time, the hair cannot attack another target. A drowned maiden does not gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition while using her hair in this manner.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any aquatic<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Drowned maidens are piteous but terrifying undead created when a woman meets her end in water due to a doomed romance, whether from a quiet suicide over unrequited love or the violent hands of a philandering partner. Either way, the drowned maiden awakens from death enraged and desiring vengeance on all those who might have the life that she remembers; only to anguish over her doomed existence while eradicating another soul. The maiden lurks in the silent depths where she diedâusually long-deserted docks, bridges, or coastal cliffs. She is forever waiting to pull the living to the same watery grave in which she is now condemned.</p>

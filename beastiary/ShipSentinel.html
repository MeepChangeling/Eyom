<h4><a name="TOC-Salted-Wound-Su-"></a>Salted Wound (Su)</h4>
<p>Any living creature damaged by a ship sentinel must make a successful DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take a â1 penalty on attack and damage rolls for 1 round as salty brine drips painfully onto the wound. On a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>, the target takes an additional 3d6 points of damage as its flesh cracks and withers from dehydration. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Ship-Sight-Su-"></a>Ship Sight (Su)</h4>
<p>A ship sentinel is treated as having <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Tremorsense-Ex-"><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Tremorsense">tremorsense</a></a> out to 100 feet while onboard a ship, as its senses permeate the vessel’s timbers. It can only detect creatures in contact with the vessel or on objects in contact with the vessel. It cannot use this ability to detect creatures not in contact with the ship, even if they are within the ability’s 100-foot radius.</p>
<p> Variant Ship Sentinels 
<p>Ship sentinels can be crafted in a wide variety of forms and are often embellished and customized similarly to mundane figureheads. The following are some of these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>‘ most common customizations.</p>
<p><b>Ballista Marksman</b>: Some ship sentinels have a light ballista built into their forms; these sentinels are usually designed to look like an archer with an oversized bow, a beauteous <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/azata/lillend">lillend</a>, or a cruel <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/erinyes">erinyes</a>. Such ship sentinels rarely have a melee weapon, resorting instead to slams if unable to use their ballistae to make ranged attacks. Statistics for ballista marksmen are modified as follows: <b>Ranged</b> light ballista +12 (3d8 plus salted wound/19â20).</p>
<p><b>Mariner’s Muse</b>: Sculpted to resemble harp-playing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">angels</a> or armored heralds, a mariner’s muse ship sentinel can use the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Inspire-Courage-Su-">inspire courage</a> effect of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Bardic-Performance">bardic performance</a> once per day for 5 rounds as if it were a 5th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>. It always uses all 5 rounds of its performance at the same time and can never use the performance multiple times in 1 day for any duration.</p>
<p><b>Sea Sorcerer</b>: These ship sentinels are often crafted to resemble <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magical-beasts/sea-serpent">sea serpents</a>, or abstract orrery-like sculptures, and possess limited <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>. They can only use these abilities while onboard a sailing vessel. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> can each be used 3 times per day, and include <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-objects">animate objects</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/grease">grease</a>, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/o/obscuring-mist">obscuring mist</a>.</p>

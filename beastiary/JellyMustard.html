<p>Mustard jelly appears to be a yellowish-brown form of the ochre jelly and is thought to be a distant relative of said creature. However, the mustard jelly is far more dangerous than its supposed relative because it is intelligent.</p>
<p>The mustard jelly gives off a faint odor of mustard plants to a range of 20 feet. Though it possesses intelligence, a mustard jelly cannot speak.</p>
<p>A mustard jelly attacks by forming a pseudopod from its body and either slashing or enveloping its foes. Mustard jellies prefer to attack from ambush or where they have the upper hand on an opponent. If combat goes against a mustard jelly, it does not hesitate to flee, though often it uses this tactic to lure unsuspecting foes in closer.</p>

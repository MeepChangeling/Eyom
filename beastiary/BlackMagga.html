<h4><span id="Breath_of_Madness_Su"><a name="TOC-Breath-of-Madness-Su-"></a>Breath of Madness (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Black Magga can exhale a cloud of foul-smelling, poisonous breath as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> once every minute. This cloud of black smoke fills a 60-foot cone. All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> and become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a> for 1d6 rounds (a DC 27 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save halves the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> and negates the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">confusion</a> effect). This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> poison effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> cannot be used while underwater.</p>
<h4><span id="Transdimensional_Tentacles_Su"><a name="TOC-Transdimensional-Tentacles-Su-"></a>Transdimensional Tentacles (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Black Magga’s tentacles allow her to see into and infiltrate the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane">Ethereal Plane</a> and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Shadow-Plane">Plane of Shadow</a> while she is on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. This allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures there, but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack their inhabitants. She can even phase her tentacles in and out of existence, effectively reaching through walls and other solid barriers to attack foes on the other side, provided that area is not warded by a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimensional-lock">dimensional lock</a> or similar effect. She can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> foes with her tentacles normally, but cannot pull <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> foes or objects through planes as her tentacles shift between them.</p>
<h4><span id="Warp_Dimensions_Su"><a name="TOC-Warp-Dimensions-Su-"></a>Warp Dimensions (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Black Magga’s presence distorts the dimensions. Any creature that attempts to utilize a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Teleportation">teleportation</a> effect while within 300 feet of Black Magga must succeed at a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check or the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">teleport</a> effect fails. If the effect fails, the creature that attempted to create that effect must succeed at a DC 27 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>Bearing a head like a plesiosaur atop a thrashing mass of tentacles and eyes, Black Magga is an immense creature indeed. Although she is effectively immortal until slain, she has spent many of her years in deep hibernation. These slumbers could last for a dozen centuries or more at a time, and are punctuated by relatively short periods of activity that generally last for only a few decades. These long periods of sleep have had something of a debilitating effect, for with each century of slumber, she grows weaker. She is now but a shadow of her original power. That she remains as powerful as she does today speaks volumes to the terrible wrath she must have possessed at one time.</p>
<h3><span id="The_Myth_of_Black_Magga"><a name="TOC-The-Myth-of-Black-Magga"></a>The Myth of Black Magga</span></h3>
<p>Fisherfolk and woodsmen have long told tales of a fell monster rising from the depths. Below are a few commonly held but mistaken beliefs about herâalthough they may well have been true when she was at the height of her power.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Blood Tongue</b>: Many who have seen Black Magga and lived can never speak of their experiences. Supposedly, when they attempt to tell the tale, black blood wells from their throats and into their mouths, choking their words. Thus, far fewer claim to have seen Black Magga than actually have.</li>
<li><b>God-Proof</b>: Black Magga is older than many gods. Divine magic is said to have little effect whatsoever on her abominable form. Anyone who cuts Magga’s black heart from her vile chest and bathes in its putrescent blood will likewise become invulnerable to the power of the gods.</li>
<li><b>Storm Bringer</b>: Sightings of Black Magga often herald powerful storms and hurricanes. It is said that the beast summons these storms to pull victims into her watery domain, whereupon she captures them, consumes them, and transforms them into monstrous, vermicular horrors.</li>
</ul>

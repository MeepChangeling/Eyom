<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a devil dog can deliver a coup de grace against a helpless opponent. If the victim survives the attack, he must succeed on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Opponents killed in this manner cannot be raised, but <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection"><i>resurrection</i></a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-resurrection"><i>true resurrection</i></a>, or the like can restore the slain creature to life.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any cold<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or pack (7â16)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The wolf-like devil dog may be an interbred species of wild dog and winter wolf. A devil dog is smaller than a winter wolf but much larger than nearly any normal dog of any breed â about 5 feet long and 3 feet high at the shoulder. A devil dog is white in color, blending in almost perfectly with its snowbound environment. Thanks to their appearance, devil dogs are often mistaken for winter wolves by inexperienced travelers in icy regions. Devil dog packs have been known to stalk and attack humanoids and other creatures much larger than the pack members. They are smart enough to use their coloration to their best advantage in the hunt.</p>
<p>Devil dogs hunt in packs, using tactics similar to normal wild dogs and wolves: the pack circles the prey, with each dog taking its turn attacking. Devil dogs attempt to rip out the throat of any helpless opponent.</p>

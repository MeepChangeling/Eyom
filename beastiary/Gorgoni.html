<p>Reptilian humanoids thought to descend from the unnatural pairing of humans and a snake god, gorgoni have moved from singular freaks to a legitimate race. The first such creatures may have existed as solitary monstrosities but now the gorgoni form tribes, take mates, and raise young as any other group of humanoids. Their mixed ancestry of different snake gods now means a gorgoni possesses characteristics of cobras, rattlesnakes and vipers.</p>
<p>The gorgoni also possess a subconscious connection to their progenitors. They are born able to draw on the collective memories of their parents and planar ancestors. As such they are more knowledgeable about the world, secret histories and legends than their limited tribal existence suggests. Other creatures often consult the gorgoni on such matters. Though often neutral or benevolent in outlook, the gorgoni possess a mischievous side, perhaps another holdover from their serpent ancestry. They enjoy tricks and deception, and often demand some minor but annoying task from those seeking advice. They also enjoy using ghost sound and ventriloquism to play tricks on creatures. The gorgoni often disguise themselves as a snake to move unopposed into the midst of their prey.</p>
<p>In combat, gorgoni cooperate to aid each other. One usually boosts his or her allies with bardic music or distracting noises while the others attack, often assuming the form of a Medium viper for melee combat.</p>
<p>Gorgoni society is neither matriarchal nor patriarchal. They choose leaders based on ability and competence. Occasionally, a gorgoni manifests a strong concentration of outsider heritage, presenting characteristics closer to their original parentage. These gorgoni inherit the celestial or fiendish template, and often grow up to become their tribeâs leader.</p>
<p>A gorgoni does not advance in Hit Dice unless it possesses class levels. Wizard gorgoni are rare. Most gorgoni are bards, druids, rangers and rogues.</p>
<p>Though reptilian gorgoni bear live young. Coloration ranges from ebony to light green, but all gorgoni have blue eyes.</p>
<p>Gorgoni speak common and their own language of rattles made using their tails.</p>

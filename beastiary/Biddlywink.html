<h1>Biddlywink</h1>
<p class="title">Biddlywink <span class="level">CR 4</span></p>
<p class="description">This strange stick-like insect flutters in the air, held aloft on fast-beating wings that resemble leaves. Its bulbous purple eyes sit above a frayed mouth sprouting strange streams of faint energy that curiously wriggle around.</p>

<h4><span id="Interdimensional_Sac_Su">Interdimensional Sac (Su)</span></h4>
<p>While biddlywink can (and often do) consume enchanted items as quickly as possible, they store these purloined goods to digest later in an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> sac not unlike a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-handy-haversack" style="font-style: italic">handy haversack</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-of-holding" style="font-style: italic">bag of holding</a>, but only capable of storing up to 30 pounds. When a biddlywink is killed, the sac appears on the material plane and bursts open dealing 3d8 force damage (DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> negates) to any creatures or items in a 10-ft. radius (though not to anything within it).</p>
<h4><span id="Force_Fronds_Ex">Force Fronds (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The tendrils extending from a biddlywinkâs mouth can be devastating when employed to attack a creature. On a successful melee <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, they deal 1d8+3 force damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Light_Flier_Ex">Light Flier (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a biddlywinkâs interdimensional sac is holding at least 2 Â½ lbs. of items or a number of caster levels worth of items equal to twice the biddlywinkâs hit die, it cannot maintain a sustained flight. Its speed is reduced and it moves in long bounds and hops that donât exceed 5 feet in height or 10 feet in lengthâthe biddlywink effectively now has a base speed of 40 feet until items in its interdimensional sac are digested.</p>
<h4><span id="Ranged_Legerdemain_Su">Ranged Legerdemain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A biddlywink can use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> at a range of 30 feet. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and the biddlywink cannot take 10 on this check. Only objects that weigh 5 pounds or less can be manipulated this way.</p>
<h4><span id="Wyrd_Digestion_Su">Wyrd Digestion (Su)</span></h4>
<p>These strange insectile-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> literally eat magic to survive. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a biddlywink can ingest a magical item of Diminutive size or smaller. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, it can consume a magical item of Tiny size and over the course of a minute (ten rounds), a Small size magical item. Once eaten by a biddlywink, an item is not instantly destroyedâinstead it is secreted inside of its Interdimensional Sac. Potions are digested quickly within and are destroyed after a number of rounds equal to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a>. Wondrous items are more resilient and last for a number of minutes equal to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a>; any other enchanted items (rings, staves, weapons, armor) are destroyed after ten minutes per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a>. Any item recovered from a biddlywinkâs interdimensional sac before it is fully digested operates at two caster levels higher than normal for one week. The first time it is stored in an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> space, it remains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/empower-spell-metamagic">empowered</a> this way until removed again (though afterward, the increased power diminishes and it returns to normal). Biddlywink that consume enough magic items (1,000 gp x hit die) transform into a biddlytree and sprout 2d12+4 biddlywinks (with the young template) after 1d10 days.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or theft wave (3-10)<br/><b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>These curious eaters of magic are a bane to spellcasters, adventures, and treasurers wherever they are found. No mage yet has had the gall to thoroughly research a biddlywinkâs incredible abilities, and thankfully, their breeders are not at all keen to allow any of the insects to spread too far out of reach.</p>
<p>A biddlywink is about 1 foot long and weighs only 2 pounds.</p>

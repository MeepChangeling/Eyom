<p>Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than that of the lowly carbuncle. Even the creature’s name summons ideas that range from the grandiose to the grotesque. Carbuncles appear to be little more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart, however, is their strange magical abilities and the fist-sized gemstone horn jutting from above their bulging eyes. Although tales differ regarding the type and value of the stone, many claim it is a ruby or garnet. In truth, however, a carbuncle’s gem is merely a highly reflective growth, not unlike a fingernail.</p>
<p>Carbuncles exhibit a peculiar attraction to magic-users, especially <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerers</a> with the fey <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer#TOC-Bloodline">bloodline</a> and any who pack supplies of fresh fruit. Many enchanters laud the extraordinary mind-control powers of these intense creatures and extol the aid they can offer mages of their fieldâthough others consider such tales something of an academic in-joke.</p>

<p>Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than that of the carbuncle. Even the name summons ideas from the grandiose to the grotesque. The creatures known as carbuncles appear as little more than overly ungainly and well-armored reptiles. What sets them apart, however, are their strange magical abilities and the fist-sized gemstone horn jutting from above their bulging eyes. The elusiveness of these creatures, their natural aloofness, weird powers, and glistening horns have all contributed to the creation and spread of wildly inaccurate tales about these beasts, making truths about them rarer than the awkward creatures themselves. Adult carbuncles stand just over 1 foot tall and about 3 feet long from horn to tail, weighing approximately 12 pounds. The horns of most males range through the spectrum of fiery colors, while the horns of females trend toward cooler shades.</p>
<p><b>Ecology</b></p>
<p>Owing to the rarity of these unusual creatures, numerous and varied tales surround carbuncles. Although few bear any hint of truth, such legends spread from storyteller to storyteller, enlarging the dubious legend of these creatures and endowing them with all manner of doubtful powers. Much of the carbuncle’s fame comes from the “gemstone” embedded in its head. Although tales differ on the type and value of this precious stone, most claim that a carbuncle bears a ruby, garnet, or almandine. In truth, however, a carbuncleâs gem is little more than a highly reflective growth, not dissimilar from humanoid fingernails. To the dismay of those believing tales of valuable gems or stories that tell of carbuncles granting their stones to friendly creatures, these horns crumble swiftly upon removal or the bodyâs death. Although the truth of the matter is common knowledge to most scholars, long-held folktales die hard. Thus, quests for carbuncle gemsâand for the creatures themselvesâoften prove synonymous with rattlesnake eggs or snipe hunts.</p>
<p><b>Habitat &amp; Society</b></p>
<p>Cowardly but practical creatures, carbuncles make their dens wherever they might live comfortably and with little threat from predators and hunters. This typically means near groves of fruit trees deep within ancient forests, amid berry briars in stagnant marshlands, or near falls thick with water bugs. Wherever a carbuncle can eat its fill and hide from both real and imagined dangers, these nervous creatures are satisfied. Such tendencies contribute to the speciesâ rarity, as they have little reason or desire to ramble. Thus, only those who wander the most secluded paths of the worldâand even then only those with sharp eyesâever stumble across carbuncles.</p>
<p>Most carbuncles regard others of their kind with indifference. A safe and comfortable glen far from scary creatures might hold up to a half dozen carbuncles, but as soon as the group proves too large for the sanctuary to support, the youngest slink off in search of new homes. Carbunclesâeven those living in close proximityâhave little to do with others of their kind. While certainly intelligent enough to form relationships and societies, most carbuncles would rather spend their days pilfering honeysuckle, floating in cool springs, or reclining amid shadowy tree branches. Some carbuncle groups have even been known to die out, as none of the members can be bothered to mate. Yet should a group be threatened, they can prove quite clever in distracting enemies from others of their kind. A frequent tactic involves using their empathic abilities to create pleasing smells and sensations to coax dangerous trespassers into the path of other threats while the wily carbuncle quietly slips away.</p>
<p><b>Carbuncle Familiars</b></p>
<p>Carbuncles exhibit a peculiar attraction to magic-users, especially <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerers</a> with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer#TOC-Fey">fey bloodline</a> and any who pack supplies of fresh fruit.

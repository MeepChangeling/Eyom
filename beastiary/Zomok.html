<h4><a name="TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-"></a>Breath Weapon (Su)</h4>
<p>A zomok’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> is a cone of flying dirt, bark, stones, and moss, which takes root as soon as it touches the ground. Creatures may attempt a saving throw for half damage. Any creature that fails its save and is touching the ground is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> for 1d6 rounds by this material. A creature can break free with a DC 28 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> check. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Forest-Step-Su-"></a>Forest Step (Su)</h4>
<p>A zomok in a forest area may <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">teleport</a> up to 120 feet by moving the essence of its being to another forested area. The zomok is cured of 60 points of damage when it does this. It may use this ability once every 1d6+1 rounds but no more than three times per day. If the zomok has swallowed a foe, the foe is left behind when the zomok teleports.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any forests (primal land of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Many forests survive only because theyâre inhabited by zomoks: plant-dragons that prowl the woodlands, defending them from the often destructive forces of that realm, and healing and regrowing vegetation as needed. Through the ages, some of these creatures have even traveled to inhabit the wilds of other realities, protecting the nature of such lands from disasters and axe blades just as tenaciously as they would in their homeland.</p>
<p>No two zomoks look alike, and rarely does one creature look the same for long; parts of their bodies are constantly growing, dying off, and regenerating from nearby plants in an endless cycle. Most rise to a height of 18 feet and stretch at least 35 feet long, with wingspans of more than 80 feet and weights of 30 tons.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</h4>
<p>A zomok is more than just a single creature, being closer to a collective spirit of the woodlands. One might step into one stand of trees and reform a new body elsewhere in the forest, the same creature but with a different body. The shape of a zomok is different each time it arises. On one occasion, it might pick a sturdy larch as its right foreleg and turn a weeping willow into its head; on another, it could have a body of oak and make its teeth from brambles and nettles. The overall shape is always draconic, but its components change, even from moment to moment. In truth, it is more a dragon-shaped wave moving through the forestâthe trees bend momentarily into the dragonâs body and limbs, but the wave passes on, leaving them intact in its wake.</p>
<h3>Habitat &amp; Society</h3>
<p>Though zomoks do not inhabit every forest in the world, they are far from uncommon, and they offer the benefit of protecting nature and its denizens wherever they may go. The finicky zomokâs temperament varies with the season. In spring, they are often playful and mercurial, playing pranks on intruders or changing forest paths to confuse travelers. In summer, zomoks find their strength and majesty and become kings of the woodland, attending courts with dryads, satyrs, and stranger folk of the green. In autumn, zomoks become weird mystics, spouting prophecies and cryptic mutterings about the fate of the forest. Only the most foolish would dare approach a zomok in winter, when starvation and the chill of the frost make them vicious and cruel. A zomok wearing its winter coat of rime-covered branches and gray moss can be placated with suitable sacrifices, such as broken axe-heads or nubile virgins with green thumbs. Zomoks have a slightly bemused attitude toward other creatures dwelling in their woods, considering them pets at best and pesky parasites at worst. In any event, the mobile nature of a zomokâs woodland territory means that there are few longterm residents within the dragonâs demesne, although some zomoks have forged extended alliances with dryads, bringing the dryadsâ trees along each time they move. Like most woodland fey, they despise those who harm treesâwoe betide any who set axe or fire to wood in the presence of a zomok. Despite this, threatening the forest is often the best way to deal with such a monster. Actually killing a zomok is difficult because of its ability to heal itself through tree striding, so a better tactic is to blast the surrounding woods with fireballs or blights until the plant-dragon agrees to negotiate. Unlike true dragons, zomoks have little interest in treasure, but a few coins or other items may sometimes be found lodged in the branches and roots of the creaturesâ innards.</p>

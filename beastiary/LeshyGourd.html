<h1>Leshy, Gourd</h1>
<p class="description">This little plant man walks on legs like tangled vines and has a pumpkin carved with eyes and a mouth for a head.</p>

<p>Gourd leshys can pop off the top of their heads and store a single Fine-sized object such as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/dagger">dagger</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions">potion</a> inside. While within the leshy’s head, the item is warded by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/nondetection">nondetection</a>. In addition, after 24 hours, the item within is cleaned and polished, and, if damaged, repaired as if by a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mending">mending</a> spell. Both spell effects have a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> equal to twice the leshy’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (CL 2nd for most gourd leshys).</p>
<h4><span id="Seed_Ex"><a name="TOC-Seed-Ex-"></a>Seed (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gourd leshy can hurl its seeds as a ranged attack. If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>) and affects the target with the gourd leshy’s ensnare ability. This attack has a 10-foot range increment. With tangles ofleafy vines for limbs and a carved gourd for a head, gourd leshys present a rather comical appearance. Intimately connected with the harvest season, gourd leshys see to the health and sustainable harvest of crops, especially vegetables and grains.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any hills or plains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or patch (2-16)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard </p>
<p>Superstition and love of rituals run deep in gourd leshys. They do their best to exactly reproduce what worked before with every trivial activity, and change seemingly random details when attempting tasks they previously failed. Gourd leshys collect random odds and ends as good luck charms, ranging from polished stones to bird feathers to tarnished coins. Credulous to a fault, gourd leshys believe nearly anything they hear from those they trust. However, their admittedly hollow heads still hold memories, and a gourd leshy betrayed rarely forgets.</p>
<p>As gourd leshys aren’t particularly strong, they often fight dirty. One favorite trick is to wait for an enemy to come within striking distance while in gourd form so that they can assume their true form and make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack">sneak attack</a> in the same round.</p>

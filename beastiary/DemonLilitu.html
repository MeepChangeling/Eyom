<h4><span id="Branding_Su">Branding (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Each time a lilitu damages a living creature with her tail slap, the wound leaves an angry and permanent red <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/brand">brand</a>. The creature struck becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round from the pain. A successful DC 26 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> condition and reduces the duration of the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/brand">brand</a> from permanent to 1 hour. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<p>Removing brands is difficultâeach casting of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">restoration</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-chaos">dispel chaos</a>, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-evil">dispel evil</a> removes one <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/brand">brand</a>. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> removes 1d4+4 brands. Greater <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">restoration</a> removes a number of brands equal to the spellâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a>. <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle">Miracle</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a> can each remove all brands at once. The number of brands a creature gains in this manner has a cumulative series of effects, as listed below.</p>
<p><b>1â3 Brands</b>: The lilitu can affect the branded creature with its create husk, husk link, and profane pact abilities.</p>
<p><b>4â6 Brands</b>: The branded creature takes a â2 penalty on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves made against a lilituâs spells, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> abilities. The branded creatureâs aura now radiates chaos and evil.</p>
<p><b>7â9 Brands</b>: The branded creatureâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> score is reduced by 4. A chaotic evil creature is immune to this effect.</p>
<p><b>10 or More Brands</b>: The penalties to the creatureâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> score that are listed above double. In addition, the branded creature automatically fails all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves made against a lilituâs spells, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> abilities. A chaotic evil creature is immune to this effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Create_Husk_Su">Create Husk (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, when a lilitu deals enough damage with a weapon, spell, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> to kill a branded Small or Medium <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> within 30 feet, she can instead opt to transform that slain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> into a husk. The targeted creature can attempt a DC 26 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to negate this effect, allowing it to die normally. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> transformed into a husk withers away into an immobile and desiccated corpse, but does not actually dieâin this state, the creature remains aware of its surroundings but can take no actions at all. A husk is essentially treated as an object with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 15 and 60 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>; it weighs 10% of the original creatureâs weight. If a husk is destroyed, the effect ends and the body dies. This is a curse effectâremoving this curse restores the victim to life at a number of negative <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> equal to the creatureâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> â 1; a husk restored to life in this way has 1 round to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stable">stabilize</a> or be healed before it dies. A lilitu can maintain a number of husks simultaneously equal to her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> bonus (8 husks for the typical lilitu); if she creates more husks than she can maintain, a previously created husk (chosen by the lilitu) is released and immediately dies. Lilitus hide their husk collections in very safe places. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Husk_Link_Su">Husk Link (Su)</span></h4>
<h4><span id="Profane_Grace_Su">Profane Grace (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A lilitu gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> to AC and on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative">Initiative</a> checks and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saves.</p>
<h4><span id="Profane_Pact_Su">Profane Pact (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a lilitu can forge a profane pact with a willing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> creature bearing at least one lilitu <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/brand">brand</a> by touching the creature for 1 full round. A single creature can have no more than one profane pact with a lilitu at any time. This functions identically to a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubusâs</a> profane gift ability, save that it grants a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> to an ability score of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoidâs</a> choice and it does not grant a telepathic link to the target.</p>
<h4><span id="Profane_Wishcraft_Su">Profane Wishcraft (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature that accepts a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a> from a lilitu immediately becomes chaotic evil unless it succeeds at a DC 26 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. A creature that becomes chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/good-hope">good hope</a> spell for 24 hours, followed by the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/crushing-despair">crushing despair</a> for 1d6 days (these spell effects function at CL 17th). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Swift_Claws_Ex">Swift Claws (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a lilitu makes a full attack, she can attack twice with each of her claws, for a total of four attacks in that round.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Abyss)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, gathering (3â5), or cult (1 lilitu and 6â12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubi</a>)<br/><b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>Lilitus are subversive and hidden horrors, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> who work subtly in their constant quest to destroy and devastate. Whereas most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> prefer to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Rend-Ex-">rend</a> and destroy, the lilitu is more akin to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubus</a>âshe prefers to do her work in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> form to infect society with sin from within. Lilitus enjoy few things more than leading mortals into all manner of sinful acts, in the hope that when the mortal perishes, its soul will fuel the Abyss. Despite some superficial similarities to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubi</a>, lilitus are not solely concerned with the sin of lust.</p>
<p>The exact nature of sin that a lilitu tempts a mortal into committing varies, for these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> are adept at reading mortal desires and secrets, quickly discerning which sins a specific target can be convinced to perform.</p>
<p>Lilitus have numerous tools at their disposal for the encouragement of sin, but they much prefer their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> victims to commit sins of their own free will.</p>
<p>As such, lilitus generally use their abilities to deceive and beguile mortals rather than forcing them to execute heinous acts. A son convinced to kill for his mother (the disguised lilitu) to rectify a grave injustice elicits far more delight than compelling a mind-controlled <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> to do such a deed.</p>
<p>In her true form, a lilitu appears as an eyeless, horned, snake-tailedâbut otherwise beautifulâ<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> woman.</p>
<p>Despite her lack of eyes, a lilitu can see with ease. A lilitu forms from the soul of a mortal who lured others of its kind to commit sins.</p>
<p>Lilitus are more likely than other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> to devote their work to a specific <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lord</a>, yet they do not generally view such devotion as true servitude. Itâs simply convenient to have a specific demigod in mind when <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/seeking">seeking</a> to corrupt a mortalâs faith and to convince such fallen souls to shift their own allegiance from a prior deity to the lilituâs chosen <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lord</a>. When a lilitu chooses to ally herself with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lord</a>, she takes on certain physical characteristics that reflect that <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lordâs</a> personality or appearance. For example, a lilitu that serves <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords/dagon">Dagon</a>, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lord</a> of deformity, sea monsters, and the sea might <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/bear">bear</a> scaly skin like that of a fish, webbed fingers and toes, and finlike ridges on her head instead of the more typical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/goat">goatâs</a> horns.</p>
<p>A lilitu that serves Pazuzu, on the other hand, might have vestigial feathery wings on her back and birdâs talons instead of hooves for feet. These appearance changes are cosmetic only and never impact the lilituâs options for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a>. of course, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon">demonâs</a> ability to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Change-Shape-Su-">change shape</a> or assume the form of a captured husk allows the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon">demon</a> to disguise her true form at will. Lilitus who serve specific <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lords</a> in this manner often have class levels. A lilitu typically focuses on class roles such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bards</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/swashbuckler">swashbucklers</a>, or any other agility- and deception-based classes.</p>

<p>Giant saw-toothed or serrated beetles are deadly predators that hide in their burrows and ambush creatures that come too close. They make their homes in deep burrows on the forest floor and usually cover the opening with sticks, leaves, branches, and whatever else they can find. It takes a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check (DC 20) to notice a giant saw-toothed beetleâs hidden burrow.</p>
<p>These beetles form colonies of about ten creatures. They are highly aggressive creatures and actively seek sources of meat. Their usual diet consists of small forest animals such as rabbits, deer, or moles. They are even known to devour their own when food is short or when a member of the colony becomes sick or weak.</p>
<p>Giant saw-toothed beetles wait for their prey to come close to their burrow. Hiding at the edge of the burrow, the beetle sits motionless until its target is within range. It then charges out, grabs its target with its serrated mandibles and clamps down, holding on until the prey dies.</p>

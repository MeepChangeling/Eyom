<h1>Fire Phantom</h1>
<p class="description">This humanoid has raging fire for hair and flame-encased fists. Elemental fire plays across its body exposing patches of charred flesh. Its eyes and tongue look like tiny balls of molten fire. Blackened teeth fill its mouth and flames dance in the back of its throat.</p>

<h4><span id="Fire_Ex"><a name="TOC-Fire-Ex-"></a><b>Fire (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p>A fire phantomâs fists are swathed in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental">elemental</a> fire. Any melee hit deals fire damage. Creatures attacking a fire phantom <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Unarmed-Attacks">unarmed</a> or with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> take fire damage each time their attacks hit. </p>
<h4><span id="Fire_Blast_Su"><a name="TOC-Fire-Blast-Su-"></a><b>Fire Blast (Su)</b></span></h4>
<p>Once every 1d4 rounds, as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a fire phantom can hurl a small globe of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental">elemental</a> fire to a range of 30 feet (no range increment). By making a successful ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, it deals 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature hit must make a successful DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save to avoid catching on fire. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Immolation_Su"><a name="TOC-Immolation-Su-"></a><b>Immolation (Su)</b></span></h4>
<p>Normally used as a last resort, a fire phantom can detonate itself in an inferno of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental">elemental</a> fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save halves the damage. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. This instantly kills the fire phantom if it fails a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. Even if the fire phantom survives, its flames are extinguished for 1 minute. During this time the fire phantom cannot use its fire blast ability and cannot deal fire damage with its slam attack. It retains the fire subtype. After 1 minute, its fires relight and it may deal fire damage normally and use its fire blast ability. If the fire phantom survives the immolation it may not use it again for one day.</p>
<h4><span id="Rage_Ex"><a name="TOC-Rage-Ex-"></a><b>Rage (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p>A fire phantom is in a constant state of agony from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental">elemental</a> fire that consumes its body. Therefore, it is always in a berserk <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-">rage</a> and gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Str</a> +4 and -2 AC (both already included in the statistics block above). The fire phantom cannot end this rage voluntarily and it cannot be suppressed or negated.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> Elemental Planes of Fire<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>When a creature dies on the Elemental Planes of Fire, its soul often melds with part of the fiery plane and reforms as a fire phantom; a humanoid creature composed of rotted and burned flesh and elemental fire. Fire phantoms desire nothing more than to return to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> and destroy as many living creatures as possible by consuming them in the same flames that now house their spirit.</p>
<p>Fire phantoms are encountered in areas where fires are already burning (campfires, pyres, vigils, etc). They step through a portal from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Fire">Plane of Fire</a> into a fire on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. This fire must be at least Small or larger; else any attempt by the fire phantom to enter the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> through that fire automatically fails. Once it enters the plane, it often lies in wait in the fire for potential victims to come near it. A fire phantom hiding inside a fire is difficult to see requiring DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check.</p>
<p>A fire phantom waits inside its fire until it spots a living creature. It then rushes out, shrieking and hurling globes of fire. If faced with overwhelming odds or facing certain destruction, the fire phantom either moves as close as possible to as many foes as possible or attempts to draw in as many of its opponents as possible and uses it immolation ability. In normal melee, the fire phantom alternates between hurling globes of fire and pummeling a foe with its burning fists. When a fire phantom is wounded, flames dance and play around the wound. Fire phantoms fight until destroyed or all opponents are dead or flee.</p>

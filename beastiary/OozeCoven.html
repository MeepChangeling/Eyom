<h1>Ooze, Coven</h1>
<p class="description">This eerily disturbing gelatinous blob lumbers forward. Three disembodied eyes float within its mass, seemingly scanning back and forth with each surge of movement.</p>

<p>Every 1d4 rounds, each of the hag eyes within a coven ooze can fire a magic ray at a target within 60 feet. Each hag eye emits a different spell effect: <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bestow-curse">bestow curse</a> (DC 17, â6 to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">confusion</a> (DC 17, 9 rounds), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hold-person">hold person</a> (DC 16, 9 rounds). All of these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> function at CL 9th. The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based, and include a +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Split_Ex"><a name="TOC-Split-Ex-"></a>Split (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a coven ooze. Instead, the creature splits into three identical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a>, each with one third of the original ooze’s current <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> (round down). Upon splitting, each copy retains a single hag eye within its mass and can continue to use its hag eye ray ability, albeit with only one spell effect. A coven ooze with 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> or fewer, or that doesn’t have enough hag eyes to result in each new ooze getting its own eye, cannot be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Split-Ex-">split</a> and instead takes damage normally.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate marshes or underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Coven oozes result from a hag eye ooze’s conglomeration of multiple hag eyes, often caused by the destruction of a hag coven with a hag eye ooze nearby. With its controller gone, and no one to provide food, the ooze feeds upon its mistress and her coven sisters. Through this consumption, the creation gains some semblance of its creators’ cunning, independent thought, and malignancy. If the coven sisters had hag eyes of their own, the ooze absorbs them into its form. Otherwise, consumption of the coven, with the residual magic of the original hag eye, transforms one eye from each of the hags in the coven into a functional hag eye.</p>
<p>A coven ooze wanders its creator’s territory, devouring any living organism it comes upon. With their animal intelligence, they use the terrain to their best advantage, often lying in waterways near frequented river crossings.</p>
<p>Coven oozes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh roughly 1,500 pounds, although larger specimens have been encountered. When a coven ooze comes across another creature with the ooze subtype, it attempts to engulf and consume it. For every 10 HD of ooze creatures that a coven ooze consumes, its size increases by one step, to a maximum size of Gargantuan. If a coven ooze ever consumes a hag eye ooze, the creator of the hag eye oozeâif a hagâmust succeed at a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or have her connection to the hag eye ooze severed.</p>

<h1>Fantionette</h1>
<p class="description">What appears at first glance to be a child or halfling has skin more akin to cracked porcelain barely covering a black, insectile carapace, and it has spiderlike legs where one would expect arms.</p>

<h4><span id="Aura_of_Revelation_Su">Aura of Revelation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A fantionette appears as an adult <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halfling</a> or a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> child (its choice) to all creatures outside of its aura. This is an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-lllusion-Glamer">glamer</a>) effect that can be bypassed only by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-seeing">true seeing</a> or similar magic. A creature within a fantionetteâs aura that is studying or interacting with it can attempt a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to perceive the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsider</a> for what it truly is. A creature that succeeds at this save or that is attacked by a fantionette immediately sees the fantionetteâs true form for the next 24 hours, even while outside the aura. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Puppet_Strings_Su">Puppet Strings (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>, a fantionette can relinquish control of itself, letting a higher entity gain control. When it does this, a fantionette can perform one of the following special actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an extra attack as part of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>.</li>
<li>Move up to its speed. The fantionette loses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a> on its next turn.</li>
<li>Reroll a single roll after it was made, but before the results are determined.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Abyss or Axis)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or cast (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>A fantionette is a servitor <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsider</a> for a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halfling</a> deity. It embodies the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halfling</a> godâs association with assassination and opportunity, presenting itself to loyal followers both as a powerful assassin and as impressive support for established murderers. When left to its own devices on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, a fantionette is a terrifying stalker of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halflings</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a> alike, positioning itself among large groups of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> children or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halflings</a> and selecting adult targets to murder based entirely on whim and opportunity.</p>
<p>A fantionette stands between 3 and 4 feet high and weighs about 70 pounds.</p>
<p>Unlike other auras, a fantionetteâs aura of revelation serves as a weaknessâa range at which creatures can see through its otherwise illusory guise. A fantionette combines its deceptive form with its ability to blend in to crowds, often positioning itself as part of a group of children or adult <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halflings</a>. Sometimes a child sees through the fantionetteâs aura, only for the child to be scared away and attempt to warn her parents. The result is almost always the same: the warned parent glances over at the disguised fantionette, too far outside the aura to perceive its true form, and dismisses the child for being foolish. A fantionette thrives on the fear it generates from childrenâthough it is clear from their patterns of attacks that these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> are either somehow forbidden from harming children, or simply prefer not to.</p>
<p>Once a fantionette is ready to strike, or when an unfortunate witness manages to pierce its illusory form, the fantionette attacks in a flurry of claws accented by vicious bites. In its true form, it has a pair of wicked claws, each made of black chitin and pieces of jagged porcelain. The fantionette also sports a similarly serrated bite; its mouth resembles disjointed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/spider">spider</a> mandibles with a second layer of chipped porcelain.</p>
<p>Fantionettes often employ their claws to cruel effect, combining an uncanny knowledge of anatomy with savage rends that tear most opponents into a bloody mess within seconds. Even creatures attempting to flee an unrestrained fantionette soon discover the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsider</a> is capable of instinctually followingâin some cases relinquishing itself to its malignant puppet strings, letting an unseen force drag the fantionette to chase down the fleeing target.</p>
<p>These gifts most often manifest in a variety of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, which the fantionette uses as means to overcome targets or as a way of deflecting scrutiny in social settings. The god’s hand is said to hover invisibly over every fantionette. While fantionettes are free-willed beings, they can temporarily suspend their independence and allow other forces to guide their malignant claws. Such lapses in control manifest in odd last-second movements, such as a claw destined to miss a foe suddenly jolting upward into a disemboweling strike. Other times, a fantionette moves in an oddly contorted manner; these jerks and jostles reveal that itâs being guided by its hidden puppeteer.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_And_Society">Habitat And Society</span></h3>
<p>A fantionetteâs patron will inevitably grow weary of its murderous presence and either destroy the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsider</a> or release it into the wild. On their own, fantionettes often assist thieves and murderersâand disenfranchised <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halflings</a> in particularâestablish a violent reputation by grafting their own long trails of murder and theft that lead to these apprentices.</p>
<p>When not acting on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, fantionettes are found in equal measure in the Abyss and Axis. In the Abyss, they congregate around their deityâs mysterious home, operating as guardians or entertainment, depending on the whims of their capricious master. In lawful realms, fantionettes fall in line, acting in equal roles as assassins, entertainers, and messengers for the deity. Left to their own devices on either plane, fantionettes form horrific gaggles. These groups traverse the planes in search of new arrivals or otherwise weak prey, first presenting themselves as lost or stranded children or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halflings</a>. In the Abyss, this deception often surprises voracious <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a>, who see nothing more than a buffet of innocent humanity and are torn apart shortly after realizing the truth of their would-be meal.</p>

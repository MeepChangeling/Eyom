<h1>Carnivorous Blob</h1>
<p class="description">Rolling and twitching like a massive wad of translucent ooze, this crimson blob reaches out amorphous pseudopods in all directions.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Absorb-Flesh-Ex-"></a><b>Absorb Flesh (Ex)</b> <br/> </h4>
<p> A carnivorous blob cannot eat plant matter or inorganic matter, but it devours living flesh with a voracious speed by dealing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">drain</a> on creatures it slams or constricts. Whenever the blob deals Constitution drain in this manner, it heals 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> for each point of Constitution it drains. Excess hit points above its normal maximum are gained as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>. As soon as a carnivorous blob has at least 50 temporary hit points, it loses those temporary hit points and splits as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Reactive-Strike-Ex-"></a><b>Reactive Strike (Ex)</b> <br/> </h4>
<p> Whenever a carnivorous blob takes damage, it reflexively lashes out with a slam attack. This ability effectively grants the carnivorous blob an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a> against any adjacent foe that deals it damage. These attacks of opportunity do not count against the normal limit the creature can make in a round. Attacks that deal sonic or slashing damage do not trigger a reactive strikeârather, they cause the creature to split. Whenever a carnivorous blob takes cold damage, the creature cannot use its reactive strike ability until after it takes its next action in combat.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p> While sages debate whether the first carnivorous blobs were created by a mad wizard, formed in foul <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/fleshwarped-cr-1">fleshwarping vats</a> in some sinister city, or traveled to this world trapped in the core of a meteor, there is one thing they all agree onânone wish to get close enough to study the monstrosity. Carnivorous blobs move like a typical ooze, rolling out blobs of its fleshy material in haphazard directions, and pulling its bulk across the ground, up walls, and even through the water. If a carnivorous blob goes for more than 24 hours without a source of food, it drops into a sort of hibernation, resembling nothing so much as a pool of gelatinous blood. The creature springs to life quickly and hungrily as soon as any living prey comes within range of its senses.</p>

<h4><span id="Aura_of_Despair_Su"><a name="TOC-Aura-of-Despair-Su-"></a><b>Aura of Despair (Su)</b></span></h4>
<p>A fye continually emanates an aura of despair in a 10-foot radius. Any creature within or entering this area must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or take a -2 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>,<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Saving-Throw"> saving throws</a>, ability and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks">skill checks</a>, and weapon damage rolls for as long as they remain within the area. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the aura of despair of that fye for one day. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Possession_Su"><a name="TOC-Possession-Su-"></a><b>Possession (Su)</b></span></h4>
<p>Once per round by making a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-">incorporeal</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, a fye can merge its body with a creature on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. This ability is similar to a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-jar">magic jar</a> spell, except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the possession by succeeding on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. If the save fails, the fye disappears and enters the targetâs body. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>When a traumatic event occurs within the vicinity of a temple or other holy place, energy often lingers in the area polluting and contaminating an object or the ground itself. This sometimes leads to the formation of a mindless entity-the fye. A fye has no memories because it was never alive, nor does it feel emotions toward any creature living, dead, or undead. Fye do not communicate nor reason, they simply exist. Though it is not bound to the area where it was created, a fye rarely moves more than 100 feet or so away from its âbirthplaceâ.</p>
<p>A fye appears as a translucent humanoid about 6 feet tall whose lower torso tapers off around the knees into vaporous nothingness. Its face always has the appearance that the creature is screaming or howling though it never utters any sound.</p>
<p>A fye usually does not enter combat unless it is directly approached or molested. In combat, a fye uses its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/cause-fear">cause fear</a> spell-like ability against its closest target, followed in the next round by its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/feeblemind">feeblemind</a> ability. If opponents continue to harass the fye it uses its incorporeal touch and possession ability.</p>

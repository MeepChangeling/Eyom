<h4><span id="Frightening_Howl_Su">Frightening Howl (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> (but no more often than once per hour), a mapinguari can emit a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo---rage-powers/terrifying-howl-ex">terrifying howl</a> that can be heard up to 1 mile away. The effects of this howl increase in severity the closer a creature is to the mapinguari, but can be negated with a successful DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. Creatures within 30 feet that fail their saving throws become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> for 1d4 rounds, then <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked">panicked</a> for 1d4 rounds, and then <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 24 hours. At a range of 31â90 feet, creatures that fail become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked">panicked</a> for 1d4 rounds, after which they are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 24 hours. Creatures beyond 90 feet up to the full range of 1 mile that fail their saving throws are merely <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 24 hours. This is a sonic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect. Once a creature successfully saves, it is immune to that particular mapinguariâs frightening howl for 24 hours. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Landbound_Ex">Landbound (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mapinguari fears deep water and is unable to cross lakes, rivers, or streams wider than 10 feet. It is unaffected by shallow puddles and similar wet areas. A mapinguari forced into a body of water becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> and does everything it can to exit the water as quickly as possible. The mapinguari sinks in water and cannot swimâit must walk through water to escape, and runs the risk of drowning in water that is 20 feet deep or deeper.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm forests<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>The mapinguari is a creature of legend, a beast many claim to have seen, though few who actually encounter one live to tell their story. A mapinguari patrols a territory so large that some believe each claims an entire jungle as its own.</p>
<p>However, those more <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/familiar">familiar</a> with the legends know that a mapinguariâs territory is greatly limited by lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water.</p>
<p>A mapinguari stands approximately 20 feet tall and weighs 15,000 pounds.</p>

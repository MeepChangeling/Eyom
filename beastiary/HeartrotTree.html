<h4><span id="Disease_Ex">Disease (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Unlike other diseases, heartrot <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> is particularly insidious due to having an immediate effect in addition to a lasting effect.</p>
<p>Heartrot Disease: Slamâcontact; save <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 25; onset immediate; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds, then 1/day for 10 days; initial effect 1d2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wis</a> damage and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a>; secondary effect 1d3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> drain; cure 3 consecutive saves.</p>
<h4><span id="Hardy_Stump_Ex">Hardy Stump (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A heartrot tree is difficult to kill. After it sustains fatal damage, a heartrot tree begins to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate">regenerate</a> and can grow back to its previous size in 1d4 weeks. Dealing 50 points of fire damage to the heartrot treeâs stump after it has sustained fatal damage prevents this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Virulent_Roots_Ex">Virulent Roots (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A heartrot treeâs roots grow deep beneath the surface. If the tree grows above a cave, cavern, or other large underground opening, its roots have the same statistics as the aboveground tree and can menace creatures underground in the same way. In this case, though they grow from the ceiling, treat a heartrot treeâs roots exactly as a normal heartrot tree. A heartrot tree canât fight with its branches and roots simultaneously.</p>

<p>Disgusting products of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight">blight</a> or other magical plagues, heartrot trees represent nature warped to its most insidious. Heartrot trees typically lurk in the deepest depths of fouled forests; they are the manifestations of the very forces that <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> the land. As a result, evil and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> pulse within heartrot trees, and the behemoths hunger to destroy anything good or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural</a> still left around them.</p>
<p>Heartrot trees are typically 30 feet tall from the base of their trunks to the tips of their tendril-like branches. When the trees grow above a cave or another large underground space, their roots are horrifically similar to their branches and dangle just as far from the ceiling. Heartrot treesâ trunks are typically 15 feet in circumference, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plantâs</a> entire mass weighs around 15 tons.</p>
<p>To most lovers of nature, the existence of heartrot trees is a tragedy, because these evil plants were not always so. Before transforming into grotesque harbingers of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>, heartrot trees were invariably ancient and majestic specimens growing in the depths of primeval forests. Heartrot trees were typically once maples, oaks, elms, or other types of locally common deciduous trees.</p>
<p>They were often once among forestsâ largest or most venerated trees; perhaps they marked a remote <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druidâs</a> circle, or were a common meeting place for forest dwellers.</p>
<p>However, once <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight">blight</a> falls upon a wooded area, it particularly and irrevocably settles within the heartwood of these trees. Either due to proximity to the center of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight">blight</a>, or because evil forces have perverted once-good magic that protected the plants, these trees become sentient, fungus-dripping horrors. A malevolence awakens in them akin to the same powers that caused the surrounding <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight">blight</a>. Newly formed heartrot trees crave violence and undergo drastic changes to their biology.</p>
<p>The differences between a heartrot tree and its previous incarnation are manifold. In the most visually dramatic change, a heartrot tree withers and shrinks to a fraction of its former size. The water and nutrients that once circulated in its woody veins turn to a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> that rots it from the inside outâand the heartrot tree becomes a carrier of a plague that drives its victims mad before draining the life from their bodies. Heartrot treesâ malevolence spreads throughout their systems of roots, trunks, and branches. As a result, they no longer feed on sunlight or water, and are instead sustained by the evil that animated them as well as the suffering they bring to good creatures that cross their paths.</p>
<p>The most heinous change wrought to heartrot trees, though, might be the sheer determination of the evil that lurks within them. Unlike <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural</a> trees, heartrot trees can sense creatures that move near their trunks, and even near their roots underground, when they grow above a cavern or another such opening. Heartrot trees can attack victims aboveground or below, though they canât attack with both their branches and their roots at once. Even when it seems like heartrot trees are destroyed, they can <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate">regenerate</a> in a matter of weeks. Heartrot trees attack and destroy any living creatures that wander into their demesnes, though they prefer to lurk in the heart of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight">blight</a> and wait to destroy wandering creatures the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight">blight</a> hasnât yet warped.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Although heartrot trees typically originate in the center of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight">blight</a>, they are restless, wandering brutes. Therefore, they can eventually be found nearly anywhere in a blighted area, from the fringes of a warped wood to its very heart.</p>
<p>Heartrot trees found at the edges of a blighted area are typically solitary creatures. They are invariably aggressive, as the abundance of lost wanderers and fleeing forest dwellers naturally provides them with victims. These heartrot trees are often easy for discerning adventurers to spotâa gnarled, rotting tree amid a heap of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken">broken</a> bodies or standing in a pool of blood is almost certainly a heartrot tree. Fortunately for potential prey, heartrot trees gorged on fresh kills are not exactly good at concealing the remnants of their prey or their presence. Whatâs more, particularly active heartrot trees often leave the torn flesh or bloody garments of their victims hanging from their twisted branches in a grotesque display of just how much the plants crave carnage.</p>
<p>Heartrot trees that dwell deeper in the depths of a blighted area are typically a little harder to spot. They naturally <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blend">blend</a> in with the rest of the blighted surroundings, and so GMs may wish to grant heartrot trees an additional +8 racial modifier on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks in such areas. Such heartrot trees are also more likely to lurk in pairs. In the most blighted areas, itâs common for a heartrot tree to stand on one side of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ominous" style="font-style: italic">ominous</a>, deep-forest path with another directly across the way. In this manner, the trees can simultaneously snatch multiple creatures that wander by, and they can ensure that their victims donât escape their grasping tendrils.</p>

<p class="description">This vile creature resembles an upright, humanoid frog with gray flesh and reddish-gold eyes. Its humanoid arms end in wicked claws.</p>

<p>Tsathar prefer to use short, barbed spears and kukri-like daggers in combat. They sometimes employ nets as well. They charge into combat with maniacal fury, and rarely use elaborate tactics, unless a scourge or priest is present to control them. They favor leather armor crafted from the hides of the frogs they breed. Priests favor the wicked kukri in battle.</p>

<h4><span id="Implant_Ex"><a name="TOC-Implant-Ex-"></a>Implant (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Tsathar are sexless, reproducing by injecting eggs into living hosts. An egg can be implanted only into a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> host creature. The host must be of Small size or larger. Giant frogs, bred for this very purpose, are the most common host. Implanting an egg requires one minute to perform.</p>
<p>Accompanying the egg is an anaesthetizing poison that causes the host to fall <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> for the two-week gestation period of the egg unless the host succeeds on a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw; this save DC includes a +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>. If the save succeeds, the host remains conscious, but is violently ill (-10 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving throws</a>, ability checks, and skill checks) 24 hours before the eggs hatch. When the eggs mature, the young tsathar emerges from the host, killing it in the process.</p>
<p>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease">remove disease</a> spell rids the victim any implanted eggs. A DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> check can be attempted to surgically extract an egg from a host. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d6 points of damage to the patient.</p>
<h4><span id="Leap_Ex"><a name="TOC-Leap-Ex-"></a>Leap (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Tsathar are incredible jumpers, able to leap up to 30 feet horizontally or 10 feet vertically. They have a +14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on horizontal jumps, or +24 on vertical jumps, and they do not need to make a 10-foot minimum running start before jumping to avoid doubling the jumping DCs. Tsathar can always take 10 when making an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check to jump.</p>
<p>When a tsathar begins its round by jumping next to an opponent it can make a full attack in the same round. A tsathar wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load cannot use this ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Summon_Hydrodaemon_Sp"><a name="TOC-Summon-Hydrodaemon-Sp-"></a>Summon Hydrodaemon (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A tsathar with at least five levels of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a> can, once per day, attempt to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Summon-Sp-">summon</a> a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/daemon-hydrodaemon-TOHC">hydrodaemon</a> (q.v.) with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Slimy_Ex"><a name="TOC-Slimy-Ex-"></a>Slimy (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Because tsathar continuously cover themselves with muck and slime, they are difficult to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>. Webs, magic or otherwise, do not affect tsathar, and they usually can wriggle free from most other forms of confinement. This grants them a +12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> to their CMD to escape grapples, and to their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> checks.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground and temperate marshes<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, gang (2-5), or pack (6-40 tsathar, with 1-4 tsathar scourges accompanied by 3-12 killer monstrous frogs, led by a tsathar <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle">oracle</a> of 3rd-6th level)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>A typical tsathar stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds. A tsathar scourge is slightly bulkier, of equivalent height but weighing about 350 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Tsathar_Society"><a name="TOC-Tsathar-Society"></a>Tsathar Society</span></h3>
<p>Tsathar prefer to live in fetid lairs deep underground or in dark swamps. When they dwell above ground, they are nocturnal. Some few surface dwelling tsathar have joined cults of assassins.</p>
<p>Tsathar communities are led by priestsâcommon tsathar with levels of cleric or oracle. They revere the demon-god Tsathogga, a foul toadlike demonic being that grants them access to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains#TOC-Chaos-Domain">Chaos</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains#TOC-Destruction-Domain">Destruction</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains#TOC-Evil-Domain">Evil</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains#TOC-Water-Domain">Water</a> domains, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/destruction-domain/catastrophe">Catastrophe</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/chaos-domain/demon">Demon</a> subdomains.</p>
<p>Tsathar are sexless and reproduce by implanting an egg into a host, which can be any form of living creature. Normally, creatures are captured or bred to serve as hostsâdire rats and giant frogs being common hosts. It is said that priests must be born of an egg implanted into a humanoid or other creature of great intelligence.</p>

<p>Tangtals, or dupli-cats, are ferocious and intelligent panthers with the ability to produce illusory images of themselves. They roam haunted woodlands or plains and often lair near civilized areas.</p>
<p>Tangtals are solitary creatures; no recorded encounter has ever placed more than one of these creatures together. Mating season is the only time more than one of these creatures is likely to be encountered and sages have argued as to exactly when tangtals mate. Tangtal young are unknown and none have ever been seen.</p>
<p>Tangtals are carnivores and prefer to dine on small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a> such as rats, moles, squirrels, and so on. In such instances when food is scarce, it is not unheard of for a tangtal to sneak into a civilized area and carry off or kill chickens, hens, dogs, cats, and even small children. A tangtal is about 7 feet long from nose to tail and weighs about 350 to 400 pounds.</p>
<p>Tangtals wait for prey to come within range before leaping to attack with their wicked bite and sharpened claws. They use their duplicate ability as a defense mechanism against larger or stronger foes, or when theyâ€™re outnumbered. Tangtals are smart enough to know when the day is lost, and if combat goes against them, they flee.</p>

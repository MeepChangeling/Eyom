<p>The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> tree draws this hateful energy up from the soil, regenerating any damage that isnât caused by fire or positive energy.</p>
<h4><span id="Fruit_Bombs_Ex">Fruit Bombs (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>No matter what kind of tree a copsewight was before it died, the unliving plant now bears poisonous fruit, which grows continually and is rotten from the moment it forms on the branches. The tree can fling a fruit at an enemy as a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> with a 20-foot range increment. The fruit splatters on impact, dealing 1d6 points of damage and exposing the target to the fruitâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. A creature that consumes a fruit or its juice is automatically exposed to 2 doses of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> (see below).</p>
<h4><span id="Infectious_Blight_Su">Infectious Blight (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A copsewight can infect surrounding trees with its evil, putting entire forests at risk of becoming nightmare groves full of deadly, vengeful trees. For each day a copsewight remains rooted in one spot, it has a 2% cumulative chance to infect all trees within 60 feet with its blight. Infected trees wither and die over the course of a week, and mature trees turn into new copsewights after the seventh day.</p>

<p>Many cultures believe that all of nature is alive, animated by a spiritual force that flows through plants and animals alike. This leads to the concept that all things are connected, and that imbalances in nature are at the heart of the greatest environmental disasters, especially when those imbalances are caused by the carelessness or cruelty of civilized races. Whatever their source, some imbalances lead to the creation of even greater horrors, like the blighted copsewight.</p>
<p>Copsewights are formed from trees that died of magical or supernatural blight. They appear to be normal dead trees, except for the bright red fruits that seem to be rotting where they hang on the treeâs branches.</p>
<p>Copsewights have an instinctual intelligence and try to maintain the appearance of being nothing more than dead trees until their victims are within reach.</p>
<p>A copsewight is 30 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Copsewights can form from any sort of deciduous tree. Conifers and other plants are simply killed by the creatureâs blight. As undead, copsewights have no further need for nourishment. Their roots tap into some otherworldly source of power, allowing them to regenerate lost limbs, heal damage, and replace the fruit they throw at enemies. As such, they gain no sustenance from the soil or from the creatures they kill. Based on their behavior, copsewights exist for the sole purpose of killing the living and spreading their blight to the rest of the forest.</p>
<p>A single copsewight can be dangerous to those fooled by its appearance. The creature especially enjoys luring in humanoids, but takes the opportunity to attack animals or other living creatures that threaten it or if there are no preferable targets within range. A copsewight does its best to disguise itself, swaying in the wind to mimic the motions of normal trees.</p>
<p>When multiple copsewights gather together, they are much more difficult to overcome. The trees conspire to catch victims in the cross fire of their poisonous fruits or to drive targets within reach of each otherâs grasping limbs. It is unclear how they communicate, but they coordinate their attacks as well as pack-hunting animals.</p>
<p>Scholars believe that the first copsewights may have been intentionally created by some vengeful fey who wanted to punish mortals for allowing a favorite tree or grove of trees to succumb to disease. Proponents of this theory point to the fact that copsewights understand Sylvan, although they cannot speak any languages.</p>
<p>A cleric of 20th level who serves a deity with the Death, Destruction, or Plant domain can use the create greater undead spell to create copsewights from trees killed by blight or disease.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Copsewights are usually found in large forests.</p>
<p>Even there, they are blessedly rare. With its ability to spread contagion and create more of its kind from the trees it kills, even one copsewight is a threat. Druids, most fey, and servants of the Green Faith are always on the lookout for signs of copsewights and strive to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Although these undead trees have basic instincts and are sometimes found in groups, they have no formal social structure. They have no natural life cycle and continue to exist until they are discovered and destroyed. Although their rotting fruit contains seeds, nothing grows from them. Only poisoners have any use for the fruit.</p>

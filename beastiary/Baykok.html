<h4><span id="Devour_Soul_Su"><a name="TOC-Devour-Soul-Su-"></a>Devour Soul (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A baykok can take a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> to devour the soul of an adjacent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a> creature. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a> creature can resist this attack with a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. If it fails, the target is instantly slain. If the creature is already <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a>, it does not make a saving throw, although the body cannot be more than 1 hour <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a>. A creature subjected to this attack cannot be brought back to life via <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead">raise dead</a> (<a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection">resurrection</a> and more powerful effects work normally). When a baykok devours a soul in this way, it heals 5d6+10 points of damage and becomes hasted for 4 rounds (as if affected by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a>). This is a death effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Dread_Howl_Su"><a name="TOC-Dread-Howl-Su-"></a>Dread Howl (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day, a baykok can unleash a blood-curdling howl. Any living creature within a 30-foot-radius burst becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> with fear for 1 round unless it resists with a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. Any creature that makes this saving throw is instead <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1 round. This is a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear">fear</a> effect. The DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Infused_Arrows_Su"><a name="TOC-Infused-Arrows-Su-"></a>Infused Arrows (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A baykok creates arrows of bone as it fires its bowâit need not carry arrows as ammunition. These bone arrows do normal damage for arrows fired from the bow, but gain a +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement bonus</a> on attack and damage rolls. In addition, each arrow deals an additional 1d6 points of negative energy on a hit. Further, the first creature struck in a round by a baykok’s arrow must make a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to avoid being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> for 1d3 rounds. A baykok can fire normal arrows from its bow if it wishesâsuch arrows, however, do not gain the special negative energy damage or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis">paralysis</a> effects. The DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, gang (2-5), or flight (6-12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (+1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longbow-composite">composite longbow</a> [+3 Str], other treasure)</p>
<p>When hunters become utterly obsessed with the chase and indulge excessively in the savagery of the kill, their souls become progressively tainted. When such remorseless hunters perish before they can capture and kill their quarry, they sometimes rise from death as baykoksâflying <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> horrors that kill purely for the ecstasy that only murder can bring them. Unlike many <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> who feed on and hate all living things, a baykok seeks always to prove its mastery of the hunt. Though thoroughly wicked, baykoks often ignore all but the most powerful-looking foe in a group, only picking offlesser creatures if they dare to get between the baykok and its true prey. When it finally lays low its quarry, the baykok swoops down on the victim to devour the creature’s soul in an attempt to make sure the creature never returns to seek revenge.</p>

<h1>Golem, Carrion</h1>
<p class="description">A lurching mash-up of rotting flesh, jagged bone, and coarse hair, this humanoid monstrosity reeks of death and decay.</p>

<h4><span id="Immune_to_Magic_Ex"><a name="TOC-Immune-to-Magic-Ex-"></a>Immune to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A carrion golem is immune to any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gentle-repose">Gentle repose</a> causes a carrion golem to become stiff and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> for 1d4 rounds if it fails a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save against the spell.</li>
<li><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead">Animate dead</a> causes the various parts of the golemâs body to shudder and tear, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the golem (no save).</li>
<li>Any magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a carrion golem (as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save).</li>
<li>Any magical attack that deals electricity damage hastes a carrion golem (as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> spell) for 2d6 rounds.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Plague_Carrier_Ex"><a name="TOC-Plague-Carrier-Ex-"></a><b>Plague Carrier (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p>When a carrion golem is created, its creator infects it with a specific <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases">disease</a>. The carrion golem can then infect those it strikes with its slams with this diseaseâmost carrion golems inflict filth fever. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based and includes a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem/golem-carrion/golem-carrion-stand-in">Carrion Golem, Stand-ins</a></b>: Some tieflings and other deformed spellcasters enjoy creating carrion golems in their own image. These disgusting variants are still cobbled together from an assortment of corpses, but the crafter carefully sculpts them and covers strange appendages in grafts of human flesh or scaly lizard hide (depending on their own weird physical traits). These golems impersonate their master with a +8 bonus on Disguise skill checks, though anyone attempting to interact with them immediately discovers the ruse. They are otherwise identical to common carrion golems.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem/golem-carrion/golem-carrion-weaponized">Carrion Golem, Weaponized</a></b>: Eschewed by all but the most ruthless warlords, these carrion golems are excellent instruments of terror. Rigged with alchemical explosives inside their chest cavities, these monstrosities can be sent into a rebellious town or hamlet to wreak havoc, infecting the local populace with fear and disease. When dealt a mortal blow, a special glyph placed on its chest causes it to explode, showering everyone within a 30-foot radius spread with gobbets of reeking flesh. The damage dealt by this explosion depends upon the nature of the alchemical ingredients used and stored inside the golem, but fire and acid are standard choices. In any event, the explosion deals 4d6 points of the appropriate energy damage (Reflex DC 12 half; the save DC is Constitution based), and infects everyone who takes damage with a random disease, as if each had been hit by the golemâs slam attack.</p>

<p>Carrion golems are made from the partially decayed parts of numerous dead creaturesâno two carrion golems are exactly alike in appearance. Most are created from the corpses of humanoid creatures that are then augmented here and there with parts taken from animals, resulting in a monster that stands 6 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds.</p>
<p> Ecology Expanded 
<p>The first carrion golems were created by a warped tiefling necromancer who passed on the secrets of its creation to his many bastard sons. Tieflings have since favored these sick things as servants and guardians, perhaps because they find the golemsâ bizarre appearance reminiscent of their own mutations. Carrion golems are viewed as disgusting abominations by most respectable wizard academies, and those who create them are shunned. This isnât enough to discourage certain aspiring young arcanists from creating them, however.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Carrion golems are most often found near the demesnes of necromancers and old crypts, where they serve as laboratory guardians. Those whose masters are slain wander aimlessly, though they are attracted to disease and instinctively flock to sites of plague outbreaks. While many of their creators maintain that the abominations are not inherently evil, and only attack living creatures when deliberately provoked, most sensible folk remain dubiousâfew wait around to find out when confronted by one. Stories abound of these monstrosities hungrily consuming living flesh in a futile attempt to feed, acting upon the fragmented memories of lives long gone.</p>

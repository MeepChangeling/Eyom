<p><span>The Bull Mastiff is a large working dog, with a stocky, muscular body, but they have slightly shorter legs than most other mastiffs. The breed is used as a guard dog, war dog, and livestock driver, and some rangers keep a Bull Mastiff or two to help track poachers. When properly trained they are very loyal to their masters, protecting home, property and other animals to the death.<br/>Bull Mastiffs stand about two feet at the shoulders and weigh around 120 pounds, though some males often reach 150 pounds. They typically have white, tan or brown coats, sometimes with a white splotch on the chest.<br/></span></p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Corporate-Will-Su-"></a>Corporate Will (Su)</h4>
<p>A charnel colossus is composed of the sentience of scores of creatures. Though they are able to work in concert as a cohesive whole, they are also able to separate their actions at will so as to not be impeded by the limitations of a single consciousness, effectively allowing them to focus on two things at once. As a result, the charnel colossus can use up to two <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> in the same round that it makes physical attacks or other full-found actions. It also gains an additional spell attack per round. In addition, a charnel colossus is immune to being turned (though it can still take damage from channeled positive energy). While part of the creature’s sentience may be affected by a turn attempt, there are enough unaffected intellects within to override the effect.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Mind-Feed-Su-"></a>Mind Feed (Su)</h4>
<p>When a charnel colossus succeeds at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check with a slam attack, it can use its mind feed ability as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> during each round in which the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> is maintained. A victim of a mind feed attempt must succeed at a DC 38 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save each round that the ability is used. On a failed save, the cadavers that make up the charnel colossus lock their mouths against the victim and begin to draw forth a part of her sentience to add to the collective. This action deals 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> per round. If the victim’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> score is reduced to 0, her soul and persona are wholly subsumed by the charnel colossus, and her body becomes bleached white and brittle and is incorporated into the creature’s mass. The charnel colossus then has full access to all of the victim’s memories (though not any special powers), and the victim can only be recovered and returned to life with a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle">miracle</a>. If the charnel colossus has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> multiple victims, it can attempt multiple mind feeds in a single round. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a>-based.</p>

<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su">Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> slain by a funayurei becomes a funayurei itself in 1d4 minutes. Spawn are less powerful than typical funayurei; they suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, as well as -2 hp per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a>. Spawn are under the command of the funayurei that created them and remain enslaved until that funayurei dies, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged funayurei. They do not possess any of the abilities they possess in life.</p>
<h4><span id="Energy_Drain_Su">Energy Drain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A funayurei can only use its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain">energy drain</a> through its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a> once per round, no matter how many attacks it makes per round.</p>
<h4><span id="Flood_Su">Flood (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> that doesnât provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>, a funayurei can create a five foot radius burst of water from its staff. This burst is centered on a five foot square adjacent to the funayurei. Any creature within the burst must succeed a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or take 4d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage">nonlethal damage</a> and be knocked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not knocked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>. A funayurei is immune to its own flood attack and the flood of all other funayurei.</p>
<h4><span id="Staff_Master_ExSu">Staff Master (Ex/Su)</span></h4>
<p>A funayurei is treated as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighter</a> with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus">base attack bonus</a> equal to its HD for the purpose of qualifying for feats using the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a>. Any staff held by a funayurei is treated as a +1 weapon.</p>
<p>This white robed humanoid skeleton clutches a two-handed ladle. The stink of the sea is upon this apparition, and water drips from its sodden robes.</p>
<p>Funayurei are created from the bodies of sailors who died due to the foolishness of their captains. These hideous undead are surprisingly organized, capable of forming crews and sailing ships with an ease envied by mortals. These ghostly crews have only one purposeâdrown more sailors and create more of their kind.</p>
<p>A funayurei attack is typically heralded by a dense bank of magical fog. Some funayurei attacks commence by ramming the enemy ship, whereas others are launched by distracting the enemy crew with illusions before stealthily coming close. Smaller vessels are likely to be flooded from afar using the water created by the funayureiâs ladle-tipped staves, whereas larger vessels are boarded and the sailors engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Funayurei fight with single-minded dedication, stopping only when they or their enemy crew is slain to a man. Most ships captured by the funayurei are scuttled, but if an attack is especially successful in creating new monsters, the undead crew might split in two and sail their separate ways.</p>
<p>Funayurei collect treasure, possibly as a reminder of their mortal lives, and their haunted ships are laden with booty. Few are the adventurers, however, who can battle these undead on their own territory and claim this treasure without succumbing to endless claws, staves and blasts of water.</p>

<h1>Niln</h1>
<p class="description">A large amorphous cloud of nearly transparent vapor hovers. Small water droplets dance and play around the form and occasionally drop to the ground. Three large sapphire droplets centered on their form function as eyes. When manipulating objects or attacking, nilns form wispy and vaporous tendrils. </p>

<p>Niln hail from a plane made of air and water; a vaporous and saturated realm known as the Quasi-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes">Plane</a> of Vapor. They are normally docile creatures, but are quick to anger, and relentless in their attack.</p>
<p>Like many <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Elemental">elementals</a>, niln are most at home on their native plane and rarely leave it. They sometimes travel the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elemental-Planes">Elemental Planes</a> of Air when not traveling through their own realm, but usually do not enter other planes unless summoned. Should one find itself on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, it seeks to escape and return to its home plane unless confined or summoned by a spellcaster. Assigned tasks are completed to the best of the niln’s ability and they rarely ask for much of anything in return. On the Material Plane, a niln seeks sources of vapor or steam in which to bathe its form so they are almost always encountered in such areas.</p>
<p>When first confronted, a niln surrounds itself with its drowning fog to deter would-be-aggressors. Those that insist on entering the fog and attacking the niln are met by its physical attack; the niln forms wispy tendrils from its form and lashes out at its foes. A niln will use its drench ability to extinguish any source of light its aggressors may be carrying, relying on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision">darkvision</a> to aid it in the darkness thus created.</p>
<p class="ed-note-header">Editor’s Note</p>
This creature seems to be missing the description of its “Drowning Fog” ability. The publisher has been notified and will hopefully publish a clarification shortly.

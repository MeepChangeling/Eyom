<h4><span id="Glide_Ex"><a name="TOC-Glide-Ex-"></a>Glide (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A leaf leshy cannot use its fly speed to hover. When flying, a leaf leshy must end its movement at least 5 feet lower in elevation than it started.</p>
<h4><span id="Seedpods_Ex"><a name="TOC-Seedpods-Ex-"></a>Seedpods (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Leaf leshys sprout explosive acorns, pine cones, or other seedpods, and can hurl these as ranged attacks. A seedpod has a range increment of 10 feet and detonates on contact to deal 1 point of bludgeoning damage (this damage is not modified by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>). Anyone struck by a seedpod must succeed at a DC 11 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deafened</a> for 1 round. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any forest or hill<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or grove (2-16)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard </p>
<p>Leaf leshys tend to the well-being of trees, whether natural stands or cultivated orchards. In appearance, they have soft, pulpy-looking bodies and wear clothing made of dozens of leaves. Larger leaves cover their shoulders, often giving them the appearance of wearing cloaks, and most adorn their relatively featureless heads with helmets made from pine cones, nuts, or fruit rinds. This leafy layer of clothing functions as masterwork padded armor for a leafleshy, but not for any other creature.</p>
<p>Leaf leshys love to play at war. When not laboring on their trees, they wheedle any companions to engage in mock duels with their twig spears, resorting to private weapon drills when they must. In actual battle, they are much more cautious, sticking to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> and harrying their foes with hit-and-run tactics, as they have a strongly developed sense of self-preservation.</p>
<h3><span id="Growing_a_Leaf_Leshy">Growing a Leaf Leshy</span></h3>
<p>Leaf leshys are usually grown under the shade of fruit or nut trees. To grow a leaf leshy, the maker plants an acorn and pine cone together, then mounds up leaves, sticks, and needles around them. When first born, a leaf leshy has no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, leafy cape, or weapon, but can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> them from available materials given a day and left to its own devices (no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> check required).</p>

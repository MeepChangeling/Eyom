<h4><span id="Hide_in_Plain_Sight_Su">Hide in Plain Sight (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A bloody bones can use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> even while being observed; as long as it is within 10 feet of a reflective surface like a mirror or calm body of water, a bloody bones can hide itself from view in the open without having anything to hide behind.</p>
<h4><span id="Mirror_Jump_Su">Mirror Jump (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A bloody bones can use its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door">dimension door</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> to leap between reflective surfaces within range of each other (such as mirrors, darkened windows, or calm water), but can also opt to remain in hiding within such a reflection. The reflective surface must be large enough for the bloody bones to pass through with ease (at least 2 feet wide and 2 feet tall). While hidden this way, the bloody bones can use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Lifesense-Su-">lifesense</a> to detect prey near the reflective surface.</p>
<p>When an adjacent victim looks into the surface, the bloody bones can leap out as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> (often appearing as though the targetâs own <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a> were ripping free to attack) and manifest in any square adjacent to the viewer. When a bloody bones uses this action, all creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1d4 rounds, and the triggering viewer takes a â4 penalty on this saving throw. The staggering effect is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Unholy_Grace_Ex">Unholy Grace (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A bloody bones applies its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier to its AC and on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saves as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or gang (3â10)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>In many lands, parents have used tales of bloody bones to frighten children away from dangerous ponds or to keep them from misbehaving, especially at night. At first sight, these monsters are easy to confuse for particularly gruesome <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeletons</a>. Bloody bones, however, have an evil intelligence. They revel in creating fear in their victims, using their natural stealth to haunt and frighten a creature for hours or even days before revealing themselves.</p>
<p>Bloody bones are the creations of horrific creatures known as rawheads, which have the ability to command these gory <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> to do their whims.</p>
<p>Even when not directed by the malevolence of a rawhead, though, a bloody bones is adept at wreaking havoc on local settlements. The inhabitants of a region plagued by a bloody bones often have no idea of the true nature of the creature that menaces them, which only furthers the urban legends and frightening stories that rise in the wake of these violent, undead monstrosities.</p>
<p>A typical bloody bones is approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds.</p>

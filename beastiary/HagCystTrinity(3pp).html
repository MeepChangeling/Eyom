<h4><span id="Coagulating_Touch_Su">Coagulating Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The cyst trinityâs claws thicken blood, forming fatal clots and scabs in the victimâs veins.Â Each time a cyst trinity hits a foe with its claw attacks, the victim suffers 2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>, unless they resist the coagulating effect with a DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> save.</p>
<h4><span id="Coven_Su">Coven (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A cyst trinity always counts as three <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag">hags</a> for the purpose of forming a hag coven with other hags.</p>
<h4><span id="Fecund_Summons_Sp">Fecund Summons (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>Anytime the cyst trinity uses any <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster">summon monster</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like</a> ability, she can choose either use the ability normally or use her Fecund Summons ability. Fecund Summons requires 1d4 minutes, plus an additional 1d4 minutes per size category of the creature past Size Small. During this process, which is a sickening parody of childbirth, the cyst trinity is effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a>.</p>
<p>Any creature summoned using Fecund Summons remains in existence for 1d4 hours once born, and is affected as if by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/augment-summoning">Augment Summoning</a> feat, gaining a +4 bonus to both their STR and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> scores.</p>
<h4><span id="Sister_Birth_Su">Sister Birth (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any time the cyst trinity fails <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save, the face of one of the secondary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag">hags</a> in the coven pushes itself out of the fleshy skull of the âactiveâ Cyst Sister in a gout of blood and feces. Doing so immediately breaks the effect, as if the cyst trinity had succeeded on the initial <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save.</p>
<p>In addition, the process is so revolting that all creatures within 30 ft. who see the transformation must succeed at a DC <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d6 rounds. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> ability.</p>
<p>Each sister in the cyst trinity is a separate personality, though they all share similar goals. The change in personality is roleplaying flavor rather than a major change to the creatureâs statistics.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate marshes<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> double standard (in lair)</p>
<p>Three hag sisters enter a massive cast-iron cauldron together, and allow themselves to be boiled alive until their rancid flesh peels from their crackling bones, until their bowels erupt in dying spasms and fouls the stinking, roiling water. Then, if their wills are strong enough, the sisters begin to change. Flesh melts together, bones splinter and rejoin in broken new shapes, nerves knit like scrap ribbons making a cloak. Three hags become one â a dark trinity of scalded flesh, popping, pustulant blisters, of three mad voices howling together in one deformed skull. A cyst trinity is born.</p>
<p>Cyst Trinities are the dark and baleful queens of the hag species. All lesser hags bow and scrape to their sadistic, filth-obsessed rulers, catering to her every whim. Lesser hags joyfully allow a Cyst Trinity to murder, torture or mutilate them in any way her infinitely black imagination can devise, but all hags hope that they will become one of the rare few chosen to risk body and soul in a boiling iron cauldron.</p>
<p>The creatures retain something of the personalities of the hags they were in their first life, buried under a layer of sadistic new madness. Cyst Trinities have a fetishistic lust to watch their victims succumb to disease. Their schemes foul water sources, poison wells and use their cursing and contagion abilities to spark plagues. Mass extinction is Cyst Trinityâs favorite hobby, and the flesh of a newborn, boiled alive, is their favorite meal.</p>
<p>Cyst Trinities are Â¾ a ton of poached, stinking skin and bloody scabs cut into a roughly humanoid shape. They have four spindly arms, and a perpetually pregnant belly that is simultaneously a perverse womb and a pus-filled boil. They have hag like faces, but occasionally, especially when one is enraged, another face emerges from the sweaty folds of their neck or from beneath their pendulous, sagging breasts, as another one of the hagâs personalities screams to the surface. The monstrosity stinks of boiling blood and rancid body odor.</p>

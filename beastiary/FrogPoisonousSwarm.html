<p>Poisonous frog swarms are composed of small, fierce, poisonous frogs. The swarm moves collectively, hopping or jumping toward their prey.</p>
<p>Single poisonous frogs mate during the second half of the year. The male attracts a female through a series of unique mating calls consisting of strange guttural sounds. When a female answers the call, she lays a clutch of 1d6 eggs in a damp, dark area covered with leaves. The male fertilizes the eggs and protects them during their incubation period. Two weeks later the eggs hatch and the male carries the tadpoles to the water on its back. Tadpoles reach maturity in two to three months.</p>
<p>A single poisonous frog is a small dark green frog with black bands or stripes on its hind legs. These stripes function as a warning to predators that the frog is poisonous. The skin of a poisonous frog is very smooth to the touch. The middle digit on each of its extremities is slightly shorter than the others.</p>

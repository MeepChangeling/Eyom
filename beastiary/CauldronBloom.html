<h1>Cauldron Bloom</h1>
<p class="description">Three thick vines sprout from this massive cylindrical plantâs base. Ruddy light flickers beneath its sloping armored sides, and it exudes a palpable aura of magic.</p>

<h4><span id="Sanguine_Centrifuge_Su">Sanguine Centrifuge (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Creatures that enter, or begin their turn within, the cauldron bloomâs stomach take 2d8+16 points of bludgeoning damage plus 3d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> as spinning arcane currents force the blood from their bodies. This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> cannot be stopped while the creature is within the cauldron bloomâs stomach. Corpses of creatures slain by this damage are torn apart, as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disintegrate">disintegrate</a>. Furthermore, creatures within the stomach must succeed at a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save to maintain control while caught in the currents or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1 round; creatures with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/freedom-of-movement">freedom of movement</a> are still affected but gain a +4 bonus on the saving throw. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. This otherwise functions as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-">swallow whole</a> ability, with the following changes: a cauldron bloom can simultaneously hold up to one Gargantuan creature, two Huge creatures, four Large creatures, and so forth; swallowed creatures can use any of their available attacks to cut themselves free; and after a swallowed creature has cut itself free, the cauldron bloom can continue to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">teleport</a> creatures into its stomach with its warping field ability, but it receives a cumulative â2 penalty to its ability DCs for each time a creature has cut its way out.</p>
<h4><span id="Terraforming_Teleport_Sp">Terraforming Teleport (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A cauldron bloomâs <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">greater teleport</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> has a range of 1 mile, and the destination must be within enough stone, soil, sand, or similar material to surround the cauldron bloomâs body. The material the cauldron bloom will occupy is in turn teleported to backfill the cavity left by the creatureâs departure. If a cauldron bloom attempts to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">teleport</a> to an invalid location, the ability fails with no effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Warping_Field_Su">Warping Field (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A cauldron bloom draws prey close with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> arcane strands, which it projects in one of two forms: diffuse or targeted. Projecting diffuse strands is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, and forces each creature within 120 feet of the cauldron bloom to attempt a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save. A creature that fails the save is teleported 60 feet toward the cauldron bloom; if this would bring a creature or object within 30 feet of the cauldron bloom, it is instead teleported into the cauldron bloomâs stomach. Projecting targeted strands is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> and forces one creature within 360 feet to attempt a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. If the creature fails, it is teleported into the cauldron bloomâs stomach. Targets must be at least one size category smaller than the cauldron bloom, and this ability attempts to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">teleport</a> the closest creature first. A creature cannot be teleported into the cauldron bloom if it would not fit, as noted above. Creatures affected by effects that block <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> travel, such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimensional-lock">dimensional lock</a>, are immune to this ability. Both save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any cold land<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Typically, cauldron blooms live for hundreds of years.Â Their bodies are around 15 feet in diameter and weigh upward of 80 tons.Â Cauldron blooms do not feed in a traditional sense.Â Instead, they wrap potential prey in invisible threads of magical energy. Snared creatures are teleported directly into the bloomsâ stomachs, where interior winds swirl in a roaring arcane centrifuge that forcibly extracts preyâs blood and quickly renders any mundane organic material to a fine powder. Equipment and magical oddities are left behind, however, meaning clouds of manufactured shrapnel circulate within most older cauldron blooms.</p>
<p>Cauldron blooms most often dwell in cold regions.</p>
<p>A consistent diet of blood is necessary for them to maintain a healthy and elevated internal temperature. They use their innate <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Teleportation">teleportation</a> abilities to jump between subterranean points in pursuit of herding prey. Cauldron blooms give little sign of their presence while beneath the ground, and their senses are highly attuned to surface vibrations.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>The plantsâ unique method of locomotion means their habitats are pocked with incongruous subsurface materials. A marsh, for instance, may have a stand-alone deposit of dense stone, and a few settlements are even founded on such locations. A dead cauldron bloom, however, may be a hazard to the local environment, as its decay slowly turns the area into a giant sinkhole; a hole above a particularly ancient cauldron bloom eventually reveals a treasure trove of collected objects within the dead creatureâs gut.</p>
<p>Their heightened intellects mean that cauldron blooms are generally quite knowledgeable about local terrain, fauna, and even historical events, though such information is presented through the unique filter of a subterranean carnivorous plant. One historical record even describes a cauldron bloom with heightened telekinetic abilities working alongside smaller beings to build and protect an entire city; the reportâs veracity is the subject of ongoing and lively academic debate.</p>

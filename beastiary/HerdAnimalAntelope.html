<p>A typical antelope stands a bit less than 3 feet at the shoulder, measures 4 feet in length, and weighs 60 pounds. In some species, both males and females have horns; in others, only males. Females that lack horns have the same statistics but lack an effective attack.</p>
<p>Antelopes graze in large herds, ever on the watch for predators. Even the hint of a threat can send the whole herd springing away toward safer pastures. Antelopes rarely fight except among themselves during mating season or when cornered by a predator.</p>
<p>The statistics presented above work well not only for numerous species of antelope, but also for smaller-sized, deerlike herbivores found throughout the world.</p>

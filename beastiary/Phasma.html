<p>A phasma is an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature spawned when a humanoid or monstrous humanoid fails its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw against a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/phantasmal-killer">phantasmal killer</a> spell and dies as a result. Phasmas are extremely evil and highly aggressive with a hatred for living creatures (especially arcane spellcasters) that knows no bounds. A phasma is usually found haunting an area within 500 feet of where it was slain when it was alive. It is not bound to this area and may travel or move wherever it pleases, though for some reason, a phasma rarely leaves the area where it died.</p>
<p>A phasma feeds on the mental strength of living creatures. By sapping a foe’s mental strength it weakens its mind, thereby opening it up to the true power of the phasma, the ability to kill an opponent the same way it died – by a phantasmal killer effect. Creatures slain are left where they fall: the phasma has no use for the opponent anymore.</p>
<p>A phasma appears as a 6-foot tall <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-">incorporeal</a> humanoid dressed in gray robes. A translucent and pale white light surrounds its entire body.</p>
<p>A phasma speaks the same languages it did in life and Common (though it rarely engages in communication with living creatures, other than perhaps to hurl insults and curses at its opponents).</p>
<p>A phasma engages any living foe it encounters. It begins melee using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-">incorporeal</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> in order to feed on an opponent’s mental strength, often focusing its incorporeal touch on a different opponent each round. Once it feels it has weakened the will of its foes enough, it uses its phantasmagoria ability to try and kill its foes immediately.</p>

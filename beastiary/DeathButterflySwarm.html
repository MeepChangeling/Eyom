<h1>Death Butterfly Swarm</h1>
<p class="description">The green and orange on the tree trunk isn’t moss but, rather, an enormous collection of butterflies. The swarm of butterflies lifts from the rotten stump in unison and flies forward in a slow, fluttering mass. The air is heavy with the sweet smell of rot.</p>

<p>Creatures affected by the swarm’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Distraction-Ex-">distraction</a> effect must also make a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Cha</a>– based) or suffer from the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hold-person">hold person</a>. This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis">paralysis</a> only lasts as long as the victim is within the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> forests, mountains, temperate hills, and warm marshes<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or cleansing (3â5 swarms)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Particularly vile creatures never seem to rest, often coming back as unliving abominations and ghastly spirits. Sometimes, though, these creatures do just cross over to whatever reward awaits them, leaving behind tainted corpses that pass the evil on to those that feast on the remains.</p>
<p>Naturally attracted to rotting material, the swarm’s new state allows it to inflict a fast-acting, necrotizing poison on its victims. Thus, it can feed immediately on carrion created with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. The oppressive evil infused in the butterflies bears down on those caught in the swarm’s wake, potentially paralyzing victims the swarm passes over. The swarm benefits from this effect, fluttering around unmoving victims and necrotizing more and more flesh while they cannot escape.</p>
<p>Undead creatures, to which the death butterfly swarm would obviously be drawn, are not immune to a death butterfly swarm’s poison. Just as the swarm rots away a living creature, it may also dissolve an undead creature’s animating force. Given the choice between an undead and living creature, the swarm always attacks the undead target. The swarm finds <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghouls</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul/ghast">ghasts</a> to be particularly appealing.</p>
<p>Rumors persist of a death butterfly swarm that has fed on a particularly malevolent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/chromatic-red">red dragon</a>. The swarm possesses the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>, special abilities, and SR of an ancient red dragon. Its poison has increased efficacy, dealing 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> over the course of 10 rounds and requiring 2 consecutive successful DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throws to cure. The swarm targets the dragon’s former enemies, but it also randomly attacks other creatures it encounters.</p>
<p>An arcane spellcaster that knows <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-swarm">summon swarm</a> can replace it with a 4th-level version of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-swarm">summon swarm</a> that conjures a death butterfly swarm. This spell gains the [evil] descriptor.</p>

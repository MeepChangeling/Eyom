<p>Thunder beasts are herd animals that spend their time roaming the uncountable layers of the Abyss sustaining themselves on a diet of rotted plants, minor demons, and other inconsequential life forms.</p>
<p>If angry or frightened, a thunder beast bellows with a low, rumbling tone. If the object of their concern does not immediately withdraw, they then breathe their foul breath and attack with their vicious bite.</p>
<p>A typical thunder beast is about 20 feet long. It is yellow-brown, ochre, or olive in color, mottled dark brown or black.</p>

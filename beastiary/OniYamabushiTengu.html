<h4><span id="Yamabushi_Weapons_Ex"><a name="TOC-Yamabushi-Weapons-Ex-"></a>Yamabushi Weapons (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A yamabushi tengu is proficient with all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monk</a> weapons and all swordlike weapons (including katanas and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/wakizashi">wakizashi</a>), and gains a +1 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a> and damage rolls with such weapons. Yamabushi tengus who do not use swords favor the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/kusarigama">kusarigama</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Steal_Voice_Su"><a name="TOC-Steal-Voice-Su-"></a>Steal Voice (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Up to three times per day, but no more than once per target, a yamabushi tengu can attempt to steal a victimâs voice as part of its bite attack. When it does so, the creature bitten must make a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or lose the ability to speak aloud. This prevents the use of any spell with verbal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a> and the use of commandword-activated magic items, among other difficulties.</p>
<p>The yamabushi tengu’s voice changes to match the one stolen. The victimâs voice remains stolen until the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> steals another voice, until the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> agrees to give the stolen voice back (a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> requiring the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> to touch the victim), or until the next sunrise. Any effect that removes curses (such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse">remove curse</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/break-enchantment">break enchantment</a>) can restore a stolen voice (DC for success equals the save DC of the steal voice abilityâDC 16 for most yamabushi tengu), as does the death of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> who stole the voice in the first place. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Susceptible_to_Patterns_Ex"><a name="TOC-Susceptible-to-Patterns-Ex-"></a>Susceptible to Patterns (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A yamabushi tengu takes a â2 penalty on all saving throws against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> spells of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-lllusion-Pattern">pattern</a> subschool.

<p>Yamabushi tengus are oni with a predilection toward thievery and trickery, wearing the flesh of wicked, fiendish tengus. When a yamabushi tengu first appears, its first course of action is invariably to seek out a well-hidden nest or other nook to serve as a lair. Despite their ability to fly, most yamabushi tengus are nervous in open areas, since itâs easy to be seen in such environs. A yamabushi tengu is more at home indoors or at night, where it can skulk in the shadows when itâs unsure of its surroundings. A yamabushi tengu is 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p>While most yamabushi tengus look like normal tengus, they can actually manifest in a number of humanoid bird shapes. Ravens and crows are the most common model which these creatures take their appearance from, yet tales exist of yamabushi tengus with features more akin to cranes, eagles, peacocks, gulls, vultures, and even pelicans. Only the features of ducks and other billed avians (like geese) are notably absent from yamabushi tengus. In fact, yamabushi tengus have a strange loathing for ducksâthey find these birds to be a mix of comic tragedy and pitiful hideousness, from the blunt shape of their bills to their distinctive gait and their warbling quacks. The presence of a duck can often provoke even the most restrained and crafty yamabushi tengu into making poor choices: faced with choosing between attacking a truly dangerous foe or using their weapons and magic against a nearby duck, most yamabushi tengus make the choice to kill the duck, even if such an act might compromise their position to their actual enemy.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Yamabushi tengus are driven by greed, particularly for shiny treasures like coins, jewels, gems, and polished weapons. Many extend this obsession to clothing (favoring brightly colored silks) and armor (preferring light armor over medium or heavy armor). Most of what a yamabushi tengu plots or plans can be traced to a desire to gather as much shiny treasure as possible, but they are also especially entranced and intrigued by avian humanoidsâparticularly tengus, dire corbies and garudas. Yamabushi tengus share the most in common with tengus, of course, for it is from these creatures that the oni take their forms. Dire corbies and garudas, being non-humanoid monsters (monstrous humanoids and outsiders respectively) are in strange ways both similar and quite different from tengus, and as such yamabushi tengus find them endlessly fascinating. In the case of dire corbies, the creaturesâ feral natures, xenophobic personalities, and overall lack of civilization make them ideal groups for a yamabushi tengu to infiltrate and take control ofâalthough in most cases, a yamabushi tengu who infiltrates a dire corby flock eventually grows tired of the crude creatures and moves on. Garudas are more difficult for yamabushi tengus to interact with, for these outsiders are generally good. Encounters between garudas and yamabushi tengus almost always end in combat, typically with the more powerful garuda the victor. As a result, when confronted by a garuda, most yamabushi tengus choose subtlety over direct confrontation. In a best-case scenario, a yamabushi tenguâs minions or allies capture and restrain the garuda, giving the yamabushi tengu ample opportunity to interrogate or even vivisect the garuda prisoner.</p>
<p>Most yamabushi tengus, though, find greatest comfort dwelling among thievesâ guildsâparticularly among those populated by tengus, in which case a yamabushi tengu appears in its natural form, using its wings as an obvious badge of superiority over its flightless tengu kin. Among thieves of other races (such as humans), a yamabushi tengu prefers to stay in its humanoid form. However, when a yamabushi tengu assumes the form of anything other than a tengu, its true nature is difficult for it to hide, for invariably the shapechanged oniâs nose remains quite prodigious, usually to an almost comical degree. Strangely enough, however, yamabushi tengus generally donât think of their unusual noses as flaws in their magical disguises. A yamabushi tengu can also retain its wings when using its change shape ability, and these pinions, as well as its beaklike nose, are a sure way to tell a disguised yamabushi tengu apart from others.</p>

<h1>Dogmole</h1>
<p class="description">This mole-like creature is the size of a large dog, but its thick, barrel-shaped body looks as heavy as a full-grown dwarf. A ring of tentacles sprouts above a mouth dominated by spade-like incisors. It has no visible ears and possesses only tiny, cataract-filled eyes, but it seems to sense its environment nonetheless.</p>

<p>Dogmoles cannot <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> into solid rock, but they can move through softer material like soil or loose rubble, leaving a usable tunnel 5 ft. in diameter.</p>

<p>Wild dogmole packs are famed for their battles against monsters in the dark caverns of the world. If it draws blood against a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin">vermin</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/purple-worm">purple worm</a>, or other underground invertebrate, the dogmole gains a +4 bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/strength-domain">Strength</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> but suffers a -2 penalty to AC. The wormkiller rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier (minimum 1 round). It cannot end the rage voluntarily while the creatures that sent it into a rage still lives.</p>

<p>Dwarves have domesticated many subterranean creatures, among them a breed of giant talpidae commonly called dogmoles. Energetic and obedient, dogmoles pull ore-trolleys through mines, sniff out toxic gases and polluted waters, and help dig out trapped miners. Dogmoles are renowned for their ability to detect imminent cave-ins and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing monsters, making them welcome companions in the depths. Outside the mines, dogmoles serve as pack animals, guard beasts, and bloodhounds. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/derro">Derro</a> also use dogmoles, but such creatures are scarred and brutalized savages, barely controllable even by their handlers.</p>

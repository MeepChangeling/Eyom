<h1>Mosslord</h1>
<p class="description">This towering, four-armed humanoid seems to be made of moss and splintered wood, its face sinister and mouthless.</p>

<h4><span id="Deadwood_Curse_Su">Deadwood Curse (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a mosslord confirms a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> with one of its claws, the victim must succeed at a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or a horrid curse transforms one of its limbs into an immobile wooden branch. Roll 1d4 to determine which limb is affected (1âright arm, 2âleft arm, 3âright leg, 4âleft leg; adjust the die as necessary for creatures with fewer or more limbs). The cursed limb hardens and becomes entirely immobile until the curse is lifted. If an arm is affected, the victimâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> is reduced by 2 and it cannot wield weapons in that hand or use the hand in any way. If a victimâs leg is affected, the victimâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> is reduced by 2 and its base speed is reduced by 15 feet. Each time a creature is affected by this curse, a new limb is affected, and the effects stack. If a cursed limb is amputated and regrown via magic, the new limb regrows as deadwood as long as the curse persists. This is a curse effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Perennial_Su">Perennial (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a mosslord dies, its body decomposes normally but regrows in 60 days. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> mosslord cannot regrow during winter months or when there is <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/frost">frost</a> or snow on the ground where it was slain; in such a condition, its regrowth is delayed until the thaw. If the region where the mosslord was slain is affected by a lasting winter (either via magic or as a result of natural conditions), its regrowth can be delayed indefinitely. Even completely destroying a mosslordâs body wonât stop its eventual regrowth. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight">blight</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/diminish-plants">diminish plants</a> spell applied to a mosslordâs remains can ensure its permanent death if the caster succeeds at a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check. A mosslord slain on any plane other than the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> remains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> permanently. Obscure rituals can also aid in the permanent death of a mosslord, at the GMâs discretion.</p>
<h4><span id="Sheets_of_Moss_Su">Sheets of Moss (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once every 1d4 rounds as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, a mosslord can cover a 20-foot-square area in a thick <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Blanket">blanket</a> of toxic moss at a range of up to 90 feet. Living creatures in the area are automatically <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> and must succeed at a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> per round until the moss dissipates or is destroyed. The moss has 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> per 5-foot square, but can only be damaged by cold or effects that specifically target plants (such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight">blight</a>) or deal additional damage to plants (such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/horrid-wilting">horrid wilting</a>). Otherwise, the sheets of moss wither away automatically after 1d4+4 rounds. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> effect and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> effects. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Yellow_Mold_Blast_Su">Yellow Mold Blast (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a mosslord can swiftly extrude a puffball and hurl it up to 60 feet. Upon impact, the puffball bursts into an unusually thick and potent cloud of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/yellow-mold-cr-6">yellow mold</a> spores. This cloud of spores fills a 10-foot-radius area, obscuring vision as if it were a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fog-cloud">fog cloud</a> and affecting all creatures within the area with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/yellow-mold-cr-6">yellow mold</a>, except the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to resist the moldâs poisonous effects is DC 30. A creature that takes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> from these thick spores is also <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1 round. The cloud of spores persists for 1d4 rounds, after which it automatically dissipates. Creatures with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/greensight">greensight</a> can see through these clouds of spores with ease. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> triple</p>
<p>Tales of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/wretched">wretched</a> mosslord have existed for as long as humanity has dared dwell amid the forests of the world. It appears in grotesque pictographs of long <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> civilizations, covering the walls of lost cities on sunken continents or hidden in overgrown jungles. So ancient is the creature that its true origin remains unknown. In the cultures whose lore and legend tell of the mosslord, it is described as the living incarnation of the forestâs vengeance against the encroachment of civilization, a fury given mind and focus toward the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/destruction">destruction</a> of humanity. To date, no one has ever reported spotting more than a single mosslord at a time, prompting speculation as to whether more than a single mosslord exists, or if it is a singular entity that simply regrows itself each time it is destroyed.</p>
<p>Most tales of the mosslordâs intentions hold true, although the legends of there being but one mosslord are a false hopeâin truth, multiple mosslords exist, and wherever one surfaces, ruin inevitably follows. Yet mosslords are hardly the simple, violent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/juggernaut">juggernauts</a> that old legends purport. Instead, these wickedly intelligent creatures mastermind elaborate campaigns against civilization.</p>
<p>Capable of commanding hordes of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> creatures, they typically spend months or even years seeding a target before launching an incursionâeven if their attacks seem sudden and unprovoked to the victims. They are clever combatants, shielding themselves from direct attacks and avoiding melee if at all possible, in order to command and maneuver allies.</p>
<p>Still, the creature is an able warrior in addition to having a potent arsenal of spells, and it doesnât shy from engaging opponents in melee when directly faced with an immediate opponent. Among all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> forms of life, they despise <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halflings</a> in particular.</p>
<p>A mosslord has no known or ties to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> world or to those worlds or planes beyond the material realm. Though the mosslord is no deity, it is a wholly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> being and the apocalyptic texts of over a dozen different religions depict its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wrath">wrath</a>. These texts often revile the mosslord and condemn those who would worship it or pay it reverence.</p>
<p>Despite <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ominous">ominous</a> warnings, history reports a handful of occasions when <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/doom">doom</a> cults praised, venerated, and pledged fealty to mosslords. Some even credit or blame such cults for the creation of the first mosslords, for it seems odd that <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> creatures would naturally form upon the wooden frames that hold its fungal flesh in the form of a bipedal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>. Regardless, such efforts tend to be short lived; as soon as the cultists capture the mosslordâs attention, they find they have only attracted its relentless and utter <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/destruction">destruction</a>.</p>
<p>The mosslordâs body consists of a large skeletal frame that towers over 15 feet tall, fashioned from rough-cut pieces of wood. A thick layer of moss encompasses this frame, creating the appearance of flesh. While a mosslordâs body appears constructed, the creature is fully sentient and highly intelligent. Despite their similar hateful and destructive views of civilization, mosslords do not cooperate with blights or whisperers, and they often compete with these strange entities for control over their woodland territories.</p>

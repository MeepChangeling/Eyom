<p>Bog beasts make their homes in bogs and swamps and feed on creatures that dwell there. They are avid hunters and a bog beastâs hunting area usually covers a large expanse of ground several miles around its lair.</p>
<p>A bog beast stands over 9 feet tall and weighs around 1,100 pounds. It makes its lair amid overgrown swamplands and attacks just about any creature that travels too close to its lair. They seem to be able to communicate with one another through a series of guttural grunts and growls, but do not speak any known language.</p>
<p>Bog beasts attack with their claws and always fight to the death. A creature killed by a bog beast is dragged back to its lair, where it is devoured.</p>

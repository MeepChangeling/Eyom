<p>A castellan can appraise and bind itself to a dragonâs horde, gaining a complete valuation of a horde down to the smallest itemâs worth, knowing the presence of every single coin in the horde. The castellan gains a +20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/appraise">Appraise</a> checks to estimate the value of items in a treasure horde, and may make such a check as a full-round action. If the horde includes intangible objects, such as investments, debts or interests in a business, the castellan is aware of those investments. It requires a day of effort to attune to a horde per 1 million GP value, and the castellan can only be attuned to a single horde at any time.</p>
<p>Once attuned to a horde, a castellan is aware that if any creature other than the hordeâs dragon owner takes any item from the horde, no matter how minor. This ability functions much like the mental alarm function of the alarm, save that it has no range limit and has an effectively unlimited duration. If the dragonâs âhordeâ includes businesses or investments, the castellan is similarly alerted to theft, mismanagement or embezzlement.</p>
<p>The castellan gains a constant <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/status">status</a> effect on any and all such thieves, and once per day, can use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/discern-location">discern location</a> upon any of these thieves.</p>
<h4><span id="Reforged_Soul_Ex">Reforged Soul (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Castellans undergo decades of grueling training on strongly lawful pocket planes, as a result, even though the creature is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a>, it has the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Extraplanar">extraplanar</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/inevitable">inevitable</a> subtypes.</p>
<p>The castellan gains bonus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> of its size.</p>
<h4><span id="Steady_Speed_Ex">Steady Speed (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The castellanâs speed is never reduced by armor or encumbrance.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> charged with the protection of a powerful dragonâs lair; castellans can command vast arrays of humanoid and minor dragon slaves, servants and guards<br/><b>Treasure</b> double standard or greater (including combat gear)</p>
<p>Castellans are a true-breeding dragon hybrid species that has established an indispensable niche for itself in draconic society. Castellans are exactly what their name implies â they are the guardians and accounts that control the vast treasure hordes all true dragons lust after. These resolute and scrupulously honest half-dragons are trusted even by creatures incapable of trust, because all dragons know the oaths that a castellan swears are literally cut into their flesh.</p>
<p>Castellans are trained from the moment they hatch, in remote pocket universe within planes of absolute law.</p>
<p>During early childhood, they are trained in combat, tracking and watch standing. As adolescents, they learn accountancy and investigation. As mature, named adults, castellans learn to size up a pile of treasure and bind its value to their soul, becoming perfect guardians mentally incapable of embezzlement. Each stage of training is more perilous and cruel then the one before. Failure in any test is punished by death, the studentâs body recycled for use by harder working classmates. Castellan curriculum is designed to kill the lowest performing 10% each cycle.</p>
<p>Emotion and disloyalty is beaten and tortured out of a castellan, and over the years of extraplanar training, the creatureâs draconic, scaled anatomy becomes machine-like and perfect. They are relentlessly serious, unfailing in their duty. They are among the most tireless, inexorable pursuit predators in the multiverse. Castellans are equipped with mighty enchanted weapons and polished plate armor, emblazoned with the heraldry of their true dragon master.</p>

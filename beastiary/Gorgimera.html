<p>A gorgimera may use its dragon breath weapon, gorgon breath weapon, and bite with its lion head in the same round.</p>
<h4><span id="Dragon_Breath_Weapon_Su"><a name="TOC-Dragon-Breath-Weapon-Su-"></a>Dragon Breath Weapon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Using a breath weapon is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. A gorgimera can use this breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. A breath weapon always starts at an intersection adjacent to the dragon head and extends in a direction of the dragon headâs choice. Dragon breath weapons come in two shapesâlines and conesâwhose areas vary with the dragon headâs type. Those caught in the area can attempt <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saves to take half damage. The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + Â½ gorgimeraâs HD + gorgimeraâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> modifier. A dragon head can use its breath weapon when it is grappling or being grappled.</p>

<p>A gorgon head can use its breath weapon once every 1d4+1 rounds to create a 30-foot cone of green gas. Those caught in the area of the gas can attempt a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to resist the effects, but those who fail the save are immediately petrified. This petrification is temporaryâeach round, a petrified creature can attempt a new DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to recover from the petrification as long as it is not caught within the area of effect of the gorgon headâs breath weapon a second time while petrified. A creature exposed a second time while already petrified becomes permanently petrified and can no longer attempt to make additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saves to recover naturally. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>A gorgimera is a chimerical creature akin to the standard chimera. It is a highly territorial predator whose hunting range often covers several square miles around its lair. The creature makes its home inside caves high atop mountains or deep inside caverns. A typical lair contains a mated pair and one or two young.</p>
<p>A gorgimera has the heads of a lion, dragon, and gorgon. It has the hindquarters of a gorgon and the forequarters of lion. A gorgimeraâs dragon head can be that of any of the evil dragons. The lion head has no mane, and the scaled gorgon head is a deep navy blue with glowing red eyes.</p>

<p><b>Metallic Gorgimera</b> Although most gorgimera encountered have the head of an evil dragon, there is nothing inherently evil about the gorgimera itself. Sages postulate that it is possible, though not probable, that a good dragon could mate with a chimera as well to produce a gorgimera with brass, bronze, copper, gold or silver heads. All metallic gorgimera have an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Intelligence_Int">Intelligence</a> of 12 and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha">Charisma</a> of 12. They cast spells as a 1st-level sorcerer with theÂ <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/bloodlines/bloodlines-from-paizo/draconic-bloodline/">draconic bloodline</a>.</p>

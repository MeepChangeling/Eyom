<h1>Gray Nisp</h1>
<p class="description">This creature resembles a hairless humanoid with smooth, slick skin; its hands and feet are webbed and end in claws, and its face has large, dark pupilless eyes. It has no noses or ears, and its small fish-like mouth is filled with tiny, sharp teeth.</p>

<p> A gray nisp can notice creatures by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-">scent</a> in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at a range of up to a mile.</p>
<h4><span id="Water_Dependent_Ex"><a name="TOC-Water-Dependent-Ex-"></a>Water Dependent (Ex)</span></h4>
<p> Gray nisps can survive out of water for 1 minute per 2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>. After that they begin to drown as per the drowning rules.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate and warm <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a><br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Nisps are a race of water-based <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> creatures that dwell in swamps, rivers, lakes, and seas. They are aggressive hunters and dine on anything they can catch and kill.</p>
<p>Gray nisps dwell in deeper water, in caves on the ocean floor or hollows at the bottom of sizeable lakes. They are isolative and territorial. They are also smart enough to realize how dim they are, and this realization makes them irritable and unpredictable. They have a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Keen">keen</a> sense of smell, and immediately investigate creatures that stray too close to their lair. Their curiosity usually takes the form of pulling apart intruders to see how they are built. Though technically sentient, nisps do not reason the way most creatures do. They have no concept of love, duty, or hatred, though they do seem capable of nearly insatiable curiosity and malice.</p>
<p>This fearsome creature is 9 feet tall, with light gray skin and a white underbelly, and weighs well over 300 pounds. It has large, wicked talons and an unusually large mouth, filled with dagger-like teeth. Gray nisps surprise intruders if they can. They may start with their spell-like powers, or engage directly in melee; they may even attempt to speak with intruders, though their innate stupidity usually results in increasing frustration, and finally a burst into action.</p>

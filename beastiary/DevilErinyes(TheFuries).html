<h4>Entangle (Su)</h4>
<p>Each erinyes carries a 50-foot-long rope that entangles opponents of any size as an <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-rope" rel="nofollow">animate rope</a> spell (CL 16th, DC 20). An erinyes can hurl its rope 30 feet with no range penalty. An erinyes’s rope functions only for the erinyes who made it and no other. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Hell)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or trio<br/> <b>Treasure</b> triple (+1 longsword, +1 <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming" rel="nofollow">flaming</a> composite longbow [+5 Str bonus], rope)</p>
<p>Known by many namesâthe Fallen, the Ash Wings, and the Furiesâthe devils called erinyes mock the form of the angelic hosts in their exaction of vengeance and bloody justice. Executioners, not judges, erinyes alight upon the bladed eaves of Dis, Hell’s cosmopolitan second layer, ever attentive for chances to soar into battle, whether in defense of Hell, on the whims of diabolical masters, or at the impassioned summons of jilted mortal summoners. All erinyes weave deadly living ropes from their own hair, which they use in battle to lift their foes into the air, mocking and condemning their victims for their transgressions before dropping them from great heights.</p>
<p>Erinyes appear as darkly beautiful angels, augmenting their sensuality with deliberate bruises and scars. Yet despite their beauty, erinyes are not seducersâthey lack the subtlety and patience required for such fine emotional manipulations, and instead vastly prefer to solve their problems with swift and excruciating violence. Often, an erinyes will stay her hand before attempting to slay a foe simply so she can draw out the victim’s suffering. Death is usually the only way to escape an erinyes’s not-so-tender attentions, and the most powerful of these devils excel at keeping their enemies alive but helpless so as to extend their tormentâmany going as far as to keep their victims alive with magic. Rumors hold that the most powerful erinyes torturers have skills that allow their torment to continue even after their subject has died from their attentions.</p>

<h1>Cavern Lizard</h1>
<p class="description">A 10-foot long gray lizard with large wide feet and sapphire-gold bulging eyes stares. Balanced upon thick and muscled, its feet cling to surfaces upon small suction cup-like pads. Its head is angular and somewhat flat and its mouth sports a row of long, serrated teeth. </p>

<p>These large magical lizards, readily identified by large bulging sapphire-colored eyes, are found only in the darkest underground places and never venture to the surface world.</p>
<p>A cavern lizard is typically very aggressive and often travels far away from its lair in order to hunt. While not territorial, a cavern lizard is rarely encountered with others of its kind. Each cavern lizard often has a hunting ground covering up to 2 miles in the Under Realms.</p>
<p>Cavern lizards are aggressive ambush hunters. They prefer to scale the walls and wait for prey to pass underneath them where they drop down on their unsuspecting meal. In most battles, once a cavern lizard bites, it hangs on until its opponent is dead. If facing more than one foe, it wonâ€™t employ this tactic so as not to leave itself defenseless against other aggressors. If cornered or extremely hungry, a cavern lizard fights to the death; otherwise it retreats if it is facing a particularly powerful opponent.</p>

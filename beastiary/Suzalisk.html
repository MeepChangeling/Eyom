<h1>Suzalisk</h1>
<p class="description">This scaled and feathered beast stalks on eight limbs, fiery plumage sprouting from the end of its tail and falling off the huge wings atop its back. A flap of leathery skin stretched between spiked bones fans out from its neck, its bizarre appearance made all the stranger by pupil-less green eyes above a beak of plated stone.</p>

<h4><span id="Scales_of_Woe_Su">Scales of Woe (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, a suzalisk can shed one of its glittering scales or feathers, creating a magical token that leeches the joy from a creature that holds it, gnawing at its heart with greed, jealousy, misery, and hate. When a scale is not picked up within 1 hour of being shed, it smolders and crumbles to ash. A creature holding a scale or feather for 1 round (such as when the suzalisk successfully uses <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beguiling-gift">beguiling gift</a>) develops a permanent reckless infatuationUM (DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> negates) for the item and cannot bear to be parted from it. As long as the item is carried, the creature takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against compulsions, curses, and fear effects. When the item is destroyed, the creature is affected as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/crushing-despair">crushing despair</a>. This is a curse effect and cannot be dispelled. Like a cursed delusion item the creature believes the scale or feather to be a precious and beneficial item and cannot be willingly parted from it without a successful <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse">remove curse</a> (DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check). A suzalisk can use this ability while polymorphed into a creature with feathers or scales.</p>

<h4><span id="Smoke_Vision_Ex">Smoke Vision (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A suzalisk can see perfectly through natural or magical fire or smoke, such as that created by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/pyrotechnics">pyrotechnics</a>, and is never <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> by fire effects.</p>
<h4><span id="Weeping_Flame_Su">Weeping Flame (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Creatures within 30 feet that meet a suzaliskâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> begin bleeding tears of fire, taking 2d6 points of fire damage per round as long as these flaming tears continue to flow (DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> negates). A creature weeping flame is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a>, and the streams of liquid fire pouring from its eyes limn it as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/faerie-fire">faerie fire</a>. A creature can attempt to end this effect as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, granting a new saving throw to end the effect. A suzaliskâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> is suppressed when not in its natural form. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>Suzalisks are harbingers of suffering and heralds of woe. Their resplendent plumage bespeaks their distant shared ancestry with phoenixes, these avian amalgams represent the fires of hatred rather than hope, and the pernicious consumption and wasteful destruction of smoldering embers rather than the cleansing flame that brings renewal and rebirth.</p>
<p>Suzalisks are primarily carnivorous, preferring their prey charred and blackened (though they scavenge carrion when it presents itself and they are able to subsist on ashes when living food is scarce). In combat they keep to the air, flying out of reach as while savaging targets with their jaws and unleashing devastating attacks on those challenging them aloft. Suzalisks are malicious but not necessarily violent, spreading suffering in both subtle ways that they find delectable alongside more unrefined methods (roasting their victims and tearing them limb from limb). These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast">magical beasts</a> relish the sorrow and discord created by their treachery, often following prey while polymorphed into the form of an innocuous animal, spying from afar as their games of cruelty play out, finally revealing themselves to the poor victim only when they are ready to unleash a holocaust of death.</p>
<p>A suzalisk is 5 ft. tall at the shoulder, its sinuous body reaching 20 ft. in length and 900 pounds in weight.</p>

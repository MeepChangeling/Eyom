<h1>Golem, Magebane</h1>
<p class="title">Magebane Golem <span class="level">CR 21</span></p>
<p class="description">This iron mechanical man is difficult to seeâsurrounded as it is by a hemispheric aura of flashing, prismatic colorsâbut is clearly covered in gold and silver runes and carrying a spear, with a crossbow mounted on each shoulder.</p>

<h4><span id="Anchoring_Bolts_Sp">Anchoring Bolts (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>Each time a creature is hit by the magebane golemâs shoulder crossbows, it is also automatically hit by a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimensional-anchor">dimensional anchor</a> spell (even if the attack deals no damage; <b>CL</b> 30th), forcing the target to make a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or be stapled to the ground or an adjacent upright object (if any). The creature cannot move from that location until the bolt is destroyed (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 15, 50 hp) or is freed with a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> check.</p>
<h4><span id="Antimagic_Field_Sp">Antimagic Field (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>The magebane golem has a mobile <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field">antimagic field</a> centered on it at all times. This field moves with the magebane golem, but it (and its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a>) are immune to the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field">antimagic fieldâs</a> effects. If the magebane golemâs <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field">antimagic field</a> is dispelled or neutralized (through some effect able to bypass the protection of the prismatic field), it remains inactive for 1 hour before restoring itself naturally. Attempts to use the traditional suite of spells to neutralize the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a> must somehow bypass the protection of this <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field">antimagic field</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Disjunction_Su">Disjunction (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When the magebane golem hits a target with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/spear">spear</a>, that target is affected as if it had entered the area of a mageâs disjunction (CL 30th). If the magebane golem strikes a new foe with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/spear">spear</a> the duration of any earlier disjunction ends (spells dispelled by this disjunction remain dispelled).</p>
<h4><span id="Extraplanar_Existence_Su">Extraplanar Existence (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The magebane golem can see into any transient plane that overlaps the plane it is on (if on the Material plane, it can see into the Astral, Ethereal, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/shadow">Shadow</a> planes). It can also attack into these planes with its crossbow and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/spear">spear</a> attacks.</p>
<p>If a creature uses any form of dimensional travel in the presence of the magebane golem (including <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Teleportation">teleportation</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plane-shift">plane shift</a>), the golem automatically knows where the target traveled to and, if that location can be reached by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plane-shift">plane shift</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Teleportation">teleportation</a>, can follow them there as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>. The magebane golemâs <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field">antimagic field</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a> do not function until the beginning of its next turn when it uses this ability.</p>
<p>Additionally using any form of dimensional travel within reach of the magebane golem provokes an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a> (even if the method used does not normally provoke); treat the magebane golem as having <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-reflexes-combat">Combat Reflexes</a> for these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A magebane golem is immune to spells or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> that allow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>.</p>
<p>Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below, though even these must penetrate the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a> to have any effect.</p>
<p>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a> or mageâs disjunction slows a magebane golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no save).</p>
<p>A prismatic spell (any spell that deals damage as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-wall">prismatic wall</a>, including <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-spray">prismatic spray</a> and other creatureâs prismatic walls) breaks any <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> would cause the magebane golem to exceed its full normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it gains any excess as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>.</p>
<p>A magebane golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/rust-monster">rust monster</a> or a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/rusting-grasp">rusting grasp</a> spell (assuming they can penetrate its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field">antimagic field</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a>).</p>
<h4><span id="Prismatic_Sphere_Sp">Prismatic Sphere (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>The magebane golem has a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a> centered on it at all times. This sphere moves with the magebane golem and it can force other creatures to pass through the sphereâs layers by moving itself so the sphere overlaps a creatureâs square. No creature can be affected by each layer more than once per round in this way; if the magebane golem moves back and forth so a creature is in and out of the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a> multiple times in a round, each layer still only affects the creature once. However, a creature moved through the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a> multiple times through activities other than the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> movement is affected by each layer every time it passes through the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a>.</p>
<p>If a layer of the magebane golemâs <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a> is neutralized (through the normal means), it remains inactive for 24 hours before restoring itself naturally.</p>
<p>A magebane golem is immune to all effects of its own <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Suppressing_Fire_Ex">Suppressing Fire (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A magebane golemâs shoulder-mounted crossbows can locate targets and make ranged attacks without any effort on the part of the golem itself. Once per round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, the magebane golem can make four ranged attacks, all at the crossbowâs full <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus">attack bonus</a>.</p>
<p>Making these ranged attack does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>. A magebaneâs crossbows automatically reload with +1 crossbow bolts but are otherwise unremarkable.</p>
<p>Each crossbow can be disabled with a successful DC 50 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> check. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> checks that cannot be made at range can only be attempted by adjacent characters if the magebane golem is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a>, or otherwise held immobile. Any creature attempting such a check (adjacent or at range) immediately becomes the primary target for crossbow attacks until it is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/anchoring" style="font-style: italic">anchoring</a> bolts.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Legends claim the magebane golem was the prototype for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/inevitable">inevitables</a>, a creature of total order entrusted with ensuring spellcasters did not tear asunder the fabric of the multiverse.</p>
<p>Many myths disagree on why the godlike powers that created the original magebane golems stopped producing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, but the most common versions claim they turned on their creators, destroying them as dangerously untrustworthy spellcasters.</p>
<p>Most magebane golems now guard places of vast eldritch power, preventing any creature from accessing the magic common to such locations, but a few simply wander the planes, killing any creature they witness using a spell of 5th-level or higher.</p>
<p>A magebane golemâs body is sculpted from 5,000 pounds of iron smelted with rare tinctures costing at least 50,000 gp, and covered in runes made from 500,000 gp worth of gold, silver, and powered diamonds.</p>

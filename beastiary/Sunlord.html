<h1>Sunlord</h1>
<p class="description">This platinum-skinned, four-armed humanoid glows with the power of the sun. Two of his hands hold flaming scimitars, while the other two wield a mighty longbow. Wings that look like those of hawk, but sculpted from silver, extend from his back. A comfortable warmth exudes from his metallic skin, and eleven white doves circle him like a living halo.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> The sunlord casts <i>aid</i> and <i>see invisibility</i> before a battle. If facing an evil outsider, he casts <i>dispel evil</i>. If he has allies, he casts <i>aid</i> on all of them and <i>see invisibility</i> on leaders, then casts <i>holy aura</i> on himself to further protect them. He only uses <i>invisibility</i> if he thinks his foe is too great to deal with in open combat, otherwise he prefers to charge into battle to inspire allies and witnesses.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Immortal and renewed every day, he never surrenders and fights to the death if doing so can save others. If the battle has turned against his allies, he tries to rescue as many as he can with plane shift, transporting them to a safe place in his god’s realm, often making several such trips if there is time.</p>

<p>In addition to the normal effects of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel">angel</a>‘s protective aura, the Sunlord’s aura grants the benefits of the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/endure-elements">endure elements</a> spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Stun_Su"><a name="TOC-Stun-Su-"></a>Stun (Su)</span></h4>
<p>If the Sunlord strikes a creature twice in the same round with his scimitars (whether two strikes with one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar">scimitar</a> or one strike with each), that creature must succeed at a DC 24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1d6 rounds.

<p> The sunlord does not need to eat or sleep, though he has been spotted drifting high in the sky on hot summer days, absorbing the sunâs light. He can eat in the mortal fashion, but usually only does so when hospitality requires it, and limits himself to a small portion of bread and water or wine. In his true form he is a sexless masculine figure. When he takes humanoid form he prefers that of a middle-aged male. The doves that accompany him are usually white but sometimes have golden feathers at their wingtips; in his humanoid form these doves usually appear as fireflies in a lantern, though sometimes they remain nearby in bird form. The doves never attack, and while he is alive they instantly recover from any injury. </p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p> The angel is a dangerous force in battle, but prefers activities relating to the more peaceful aspects of his faith. In times of peace he wanders the world disguised as a humble priest, using his spell-like abilities to cure sickness and injuries. He dislikes lies and riddles, but enjoys long, truthful stories, especially if they illustrate a moral point. In communities struggling to harvest enough food, he uses <i>daylight</i> and <i>continual flame</i> to illuminate their fields and granaries to give them extra time. When confronting evildoers he likes to stun them, tie them up, and drag them to town for an appropriate punishmentâand a chance to atone for their sins. </p>
<p> Some claim that he is reborn every day. Certainly he has died in battle and appeared unharmed at a later time, though there is insufficient evidence to answer whether he actually rises again at the dawn.</p>

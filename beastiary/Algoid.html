<h4><a name="TOC-Animate-Trees-Su-"></a>Animate Trees (Su)</h4>
<p> An algoid can animate trees within 90 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter, it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights using the stats below. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the algoid that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. This ability is otherwise similar to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/liveoak">liveoak</a>. </p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Mind-Blast-Sp-"></a><b>Mind Blast (Sp)</b></h4>
<p>Once per day, an algoid can use a mind blast in a 60-foot cone. Any creature caught in the cone must succeed on a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 3d4 rounds. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based and includes a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Vulnerability-to-Water-Ex-"></a>Vulnerability to Water (Ex)</h4>
<p>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/control-water">control water</a> spell deals 1d6 points of damage per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> (maximum 10d6) to an algoid (no save).</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate marshes<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair or cluster (3â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>The algoid is a living colony of algae that has developed some semblance of intelligence and mobility. It is roughly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> in shape and resembles a green <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>. Algoids make their lairs in marshes and swamps. They are often encountered with other marsh-dwelling sentient plants; though never with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/shambling-mound">shambling mounds</a> (they hate them and usually attack them on sight). The algoid is 7 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds. In its natural surroundings, it is nearly invisible until it attacks and uses this to its advantage when prey is nearby. The âskinâ of an algoid is coarse and rough with a leafy texture. The algoid often lies in wait, partially submerged in water or a bog, until its prey passes nearby. It springs to attack with its powerful fists when its opponents come within range.</p>

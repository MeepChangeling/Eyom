<p>The magnesium spirit is an evil creature from an unknown plane, though it is agreed among sages that its origin definitely does not lie on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. Believed to have been summoned by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerers</a> to do their bidding, the magnesium spirit desires nothing more than to return to its home plane. Its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-">incorporeal</a> form prevents this, however, and it requires a physical body to complete the spell ritual needed to return it home.</p>
<p>A magnesium spirit attacks first by attempting to blind its opponents before attacking with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-">incorporeal</a> tail slap. Once it has dealt the requisite <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Strength damage</a> to a foe, it uses its soul portal ability against that target.</p>
<p>A magnesium spirit’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a>, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purposes of overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>.</p>

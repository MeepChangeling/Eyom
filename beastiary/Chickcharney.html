<h1>Chickcharney</h1>
<p class="description">Resembling a filthy owl with the gangly long legs of a stork, this almost comically ugly bird has piercing black eyes and emits an annoying screech.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Blessed-Trill-Su-"></a>Blessed Trill (Su)</h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a chickcharney can emit a melodious trill that grants all creatures within a 20-foot radius a +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus">morale bonus</a> on saving throws for the rest of the day. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Ill-Luck-Su-"></a>Ill Luck (Su)</h4>
<p>When a chickcharney hits a creature with one of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a>, the target is exposed to the chickcharney’s curse.</p>
<p><b>Curse of Ill Luck</b>: <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 14; <i>effect</i> the creature takes a â1 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.</p>
<p>A creature can be affected by a curse of ill luck multiple times (up to a maximum cumulative penalty of â4). Chickcharneys are immune to this curse. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Maddening-Screech-Su-"></a>Maddening Screech (Su)</h4>
<p>Three times per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a chickcharney can emit a piercing cry that affects all other creatures within a 30-foot radius. An affected creature must succeed at a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a> for 1d3 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm forests, hills, or plains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or nesting pair<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>While this unusual creature is often initially laughed at for its unsightly appearance and awkward gait, the tempestuous bird is a force to be reckoned with in its own way. A chickcharney can grant good luck to those it deems worthy of its gifts, but its favor can just as easily turn to scorn, and a mere scratch from a chickcharney’s accursed beak or claws has spelled the end for countless unwary seafarers.</p>
<p>Naturally curious and trusting, chickcharneys freely approach most non-threatening <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>, even accompanying them for short times and often leaving their nesting spots unprotected if they have no eggs or mate. However, they are fickle things, and if they recognize hostility or rudeness, they inflict all manner of chaos upon those who provoke them. Chickcharneys fiercely protect their eggs and young, their eggs being highly coveted by predators as well as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>. The shells are thought to possess alchemical properties that can be employed in numerous formulae, and many <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">alchemists</a> are willing to pay exorbitant sums for intact specimens.</p>
<p>A chickcharney is 3 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.</p>

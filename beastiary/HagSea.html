<h1>Hag, Sea</h1>
<p class="description">Hair like rotting seaweed drapes this ancient witch. Loose, algae-colored skin sags off her starved frame.</p>

<p> Monstrous sea witches, these wicked hags possess terrifying features that few dare look upon. Reveling in discord, the foul creatures drag sailors to watery graves and torment the peoples of the oceans with wicked promises. Sea hags are always terrible to look upon, and despite their gluttonous ways, they are usually emaciated creatures who look half-starved. Most stand about 6 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds.</p>
<p> Sea hags prefer to dwell relatively close to shore where fishermen and trading vessels are more commonly encountered. Most choose to live far from urban areas so that their acts don’t draw as much attention from would-be enemies, but it’s not uncommon for a particularly brave or eager sea hag to settle in a city harbor or in the mouth of a deep river.</p>

<h4><span id="Compel_Plants_Su"><a name="TOC-Compel-Plants-Su-"></a>Compel Plants (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A fungus queen’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> powers and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> (and spells, should the fungus queen gain the ability to cast them) affect <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> creatures (but not mindless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> creatures) as if they weren’t immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effects.</p>
<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su"><a name="TOC-Create-Spawn-Su-"></a>Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature that would normally be slain by a fungus queen’s <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain">energy drain</a> attack is not killedâinstead, it immediately loses all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> imparted by the fungus queen and transforms into a fungus-infested minion of the queen. Such creatures gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/fungoid-simple-template-cr-1">fungoid simple template</a>. Fungoid creatures are under the control of the fungus creature that created them, and remain enslaved until their mistress is destroyed or until they are cured of the infestation (see the facing page). A fungus queen can communicate telepathically with her fungoid spawn at any range as long as they are on the same plane, and may have a number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> worth of enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice her own <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>; any spawn she creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed fungoid creatures. A fungus queen may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a fungoid creature cannot be enslaved again (although it can still be influenced by the fungus queen’s compel plants and plant empathy abilities).</p>
<h4><span id="Energy_Drain_Su"><a name="TOC-Energy-Drain-Su-"></a>Energy Drain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A fungus queen’s <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain">energy drain</a> functions identically to that of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubus</a>. Creatures killed by this attack do not dieâthey instead become infested with the fungus queen’s spores (see Create Spawn). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Plant_Empathy_Ex"><a name="TOC-Plant-Empathy-Ex-"></a>Plant Empathy (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>This ability functions as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-">wild empathy</a>, save that a fungus queen can use this ability only on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> creatures. A fungus queen gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on this check. Mindless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> creatures are imparted a modicum of implanted intelligence when a fungus queen uses this ability, allowing her to train such creatures as guardians.</p>
<h4><span id="Sporepod_Su"><a name="TOC-Sporepod-Su-"></a>Sporepod (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a fungus queen can cause a Medium pod of fungal material to burst out of the ground at any point within 60 feet of her current location. Once created, a sporepod cannot move. If the fungus queen travels more than 120 feet from a sporepod, it is destroyed. A fungus queen can maintain a number of sporepods equal to her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier (7 for the typical fungus queen). As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, she can instantaneously travel to one of her sporepods as if using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transport-via-plants">transport via plants</a>. She can also choose to spread out her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/tentacle-ex">tentacle</a> attacks among her sporepods, attacking a creature within 5 feet of any sporepod with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/tentacle-ex">tentacle</a>âshe is still limited to making only four <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/tentacle-ex">tentacle</a> attacks as part of a full-attack action, or one as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. A sporepod is an object that has an AC of 15 and 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>; damage dealt to a sporepod does not harm the fungus queen.</p>
<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/extras/community-use/d20pfsrd-com-source-logos#TOC-Source-Pathfinder-Accessory"></a>
<p><b>Environment</b> any underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or cult (fungus queen plus 2â16 mind-controlled plants and minions)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>An encounter with a normally non-intelligent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> monster acting in a sinister and organized way is sure evidence of the manipulation of a fungus queen, but these monsters are equally fond of commanding and keeping other creatures as pets and slaves as well, particularly attractive <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>. Those charmed minions they especially favor are given the gift of the fungus queen’s embrace, and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid mistress.</p>
<p>Fungus queens are violently jealous and possessive. Those who attempt to lure away their charmed and dominated pets or cure those they have infested gain their eternal ire, but it is by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubi</a> that fungus queens are the most enraged. Whether it be a simple territorial conflict or some deeper hatred born of their unique genesis, a fungus queen faced with someone whom she even suspects might be a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubus</a> is a terror indeed, for in such battles the sensuous plants abandon their normally subtle approaches of mental control and trickery, and instead bring all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature limb from limb. Fungus queens take great delight in transforming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubi</a> into fungoid creatures under their control. While their jealousy doesn’t compel them to do battle with other fungus queens, they are always careful to maintain their own territorial boundaries apart from any nearby queens, and they take great pains not to -poach- from their sisters’ harems of charmed and infested pets.</p>
<p>Many fungus queens grow quite powerful over time, typically gaining class levels in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">ranger</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerer</a>âthey generally do not become more powerful by merely gaining racial <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> or increasing in size. A typical fungus queen is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.</p>

<h4><span id="Greedy_Guzzle_Ex">Greedy Guzzle (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If a great gator ghoul successfully swallows an opponent whole on its turn, it may make a bite attack as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> against any creature in its reach.</p>
<h4><span id="Improved_Deadlights_Su">Improved Deadlights (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a gator ghoul can cause a 60 ft. cone of bright light to emit from its eyes for up to 1 minute. All living creatures in the area must succeed a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a>. A creature so affected can attempt a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save on its turn as a full round action to break out of the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daze">daze</a>. A creature that succeeds its saving throw is immune to the deadlights of that gator ghoul for the next 24 hours. A gator ghoul can stop this ability as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> on its turn, and can use this ability three times per day. This is a mind-influencing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect, and the save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> based.</p>
<p>This enormous monster appears as a humanoid crocodile as tall as a building, with blazing eyes and oversized clawed hands.</p>
<p>Although most gator ghouls form from the bodies of average alligators or crocodiles, there are giant crocodiles that lurk in the remote corners of the world. These too can rise as gator ghouls, and great gator ghouls are even more ravenous and deadly than their lesser kin. Their favored prey includes giants along with mundane humanoids, and a single great gator ghoul can lead to an entire marsh or coastline becoming depopulated. Their mesmerizing light is powerful enough to completely paralyze those caught in it, and they gobble up paralyzed foes to die a crushing death in their guts.</p>

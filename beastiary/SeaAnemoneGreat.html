<h1>Sea Anemone, Great</h1>
<p class="description">This is a flowerlike creature with a dark green to gray trunk and a brightly colored interior. It has a smooth front bordered by dozens of fleshy tendrils, and a rougher outer trunk. At the center of the creatureâs front is a circular opening that leads into its interior.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Acid-Cloud-Ex-"></a>Acid Cloud (Ex)</h4>
<p>When provoked, the great sea anemone can eject the contents of its stomach, including any creatures being digested. This forms a cloud of acidic mucous in a 20-foot radius that deals 3d8 points of acid damage (DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a>, half) for 1d3 rounds before dissipating. It can only do this once per minute. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, the great sea anemone can retract its vulnerable front and tendrils into its trunk. While in this curl it cannot attack with its tendrils, though it can eject its acid cloud and gains a +15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a> to AC from the thick, rubbery hide of its trunk.</p>

<p>These gigantic but primitive life forms feed on sea life swept near them, and may pose a threat to anyone unlucky enough to move within their threat range. In rocky areas, a great sea anemone has a green interior.</p>
<p>These horrors lurk in areas near the surface of the water, where tidal currents sweep water laden with fish across their surfaces. Great sea anemones in the open are easily spotted and avoided, but they sometimes lurk at the end of rocky channels or around bends, whereupon they pose a hazard to unwary undersea travelers. In addition to being found in reefs and shoals, many undersea races harvest these creatures when young and plant them in or near their lairs to serve as sentinels against unwanted intrusion. Care must be taken in this process, for the anemone is very difficult to train, and may well snack on the very creatures who cultivated it.</p>
<p>The great sea anemone is immobile.</p>
<p>Great sea anemones snag anything large enough that comes within their reach with their tendrils. Once their intended victim stops struggling, it is drawn into the anemoneâs interior, where it is digested. If injured it withdraws its body into its rubbery trunk, and if badly injured it expels the contents of its stomach in a cloud of acid.</p>

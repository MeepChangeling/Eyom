<h4><span id="Babble_Su"><a name="TOC-Babble-Su-"></a>Babble (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An allip constantly mutters to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated">fascinated</a> for 2d4 rounds. While a target is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated">fascinated</a>, the allip can approach it without breaking the effect, but an attack by the allip does end the effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip’s babble for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Madness_Su"><a name="TOC-Madness-Su-"></a>Madness (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic effect makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Touch_of_Insanity_Su"><a name="TOC-Touch-of-Insanity-Su-"></a>Touch of Insanity (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The touch of an allip deals 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> (DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> negates). A successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> causes 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> and 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Wisdom drain</a> (instead of double <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a>). With each successful attack, an allip gains 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>.

<p>Those who fall prey to madness and take their own lives sometimes find themselves lost on the path to the afterlife, trapped in a state between life and death. These unfortunates, known as allips, suffer from the violent and incurable insanity they faced in life and take out their terror, confusion, and rage upon the living. They reach out to those they encounterâpossibly in wrath, but also perhaps oblivious to their own insane natureâspreading the psychoses that led to their own untimely deaths.</p>
<p>In combat, allips relentlessly attack the nearest living creature, relying on their babble to let them close in before attacking with their touch of insanity. Many seem to be driven to states of ferocity upon witnessing the terror living creatures exhibit when facing their spectral forms, or when faced with the intangibility of their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-">incorporeal</a> states. While allips have no way to kill creatures, those knocked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> by an allip’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Wisdom-draining</a> touch often emerge from the state suffering from insanityâa fate that many would say qualifies as worse than death.</p>
<p>Allips often seek to harm those who played a part in causing their mad, unholy condition. When faced with such foes, an allip ignores all other targets that confront it in favor of its hated enemies, attacking them until its tormentors have been forced into a vacant stupor. Alas, such vengeance does not put the allip to rest, but simply serves to further fuel its madness as it finds itself trapped in a world now no longer even holding the satisfaction of vengeance.</p>

<p><b>Scribbling Allip (+1 CR)</b>: Reports from reputable ghost hunters claim that some rare allips have developed the ability to physically manifest their babbled words into tangible, ectoplasmic script, expectorating their mutterings corporeally like tangled webs that drape across dungeon corridors and haunted hallways. This ability manifests as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/web">web</a> special attack. Adventurers attempting to read these web-like words must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated">fascinated</a> for 2d4 rounds, just as if they were subject to the allipâs babble ability.</p>

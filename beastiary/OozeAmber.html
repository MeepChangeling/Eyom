<h4><span id="Ability_Drain_Ex"><a name="TOC-Ability-Drain-Ex-"></a>Ability Drain (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If not purged from the host body, the acids and protoplasm of an amber ooze begin damaging its host’s body and mind. After 1 week, the host takes 1 point each of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Charisma drain</a> per day. When one of the three abilities reaches 0, the host dies.</p>
<h4><span id="Infuse_Ex"><a name="TOC-Infuse-Ex-"></a>Infuse (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A victim that has ingested an amber ooze must succeed on a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or the amber ooze infuses itself into his body. The ooze merges with flesh and bone, and can only be removed by a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease">remove disease</a> spell. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic">detect magic</a> (or similar magic) cast on the host reveals the amber ooze.</p>
<p>If the victim succeeds on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save, the amber ooze takes 1 point of acid damage per round from the host’s digestive juices. Once it begins to take damage, the ooze retreats from the host’s body through its mouth.</p>
<h4><span id="Weaken_Will_Su"><a name="TOC-Weaken-Will-Su-"></a>Weaken Will (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An amber ooze that has infused itself into a host weakens the will of its victim. As long as the amber ooze remains in the host, he takes a -4 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves to resist mind-affecting spells and effects (such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person">charm person</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any temperate or warm land<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Amber oozes were created by an evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizard</a> as a means of gaining control over the elders of a powerful city. He bred many of the creatures in secret and sealed them into kegs of ale, then hired merchants to distribute this ale throughout the city. The wizard was ultimately slain and the city saved by a band of heroic adventurers.</p>
<p>An amber ooze is approximately 1 foot in diameter, and is a dark amber color. The designs of the mad mage even provided the amber ooze with the scent of mead or heady ale. Amber oozes can lay in a state of hibernation for years, coming out of it only to replicate – a process they undergo once every few months – or when they are alerted by movement of the keg.</p>
<p>When a keg containing an amber ooze is tapped, the creature makes its way to the opening. Within the drawing of a few drinks, the amber ooze squeezes out of the tap and into the mug. As soon as the victim drinks, the ooze forces itself down the victim’s throat and into its belly.</p>

<h1>Skull Ripper</h1>
<p class="description">A fearsome chittering heralds the approach of this morbid monstrosity. A giant headless scorpion-like thing of blackened bone and chitin rounds the corner ahead, scuttling along the wall as its two pincers snap ominously. A long, grisly tail composed of dozens of chattering skulls arches up over its back. Some of the skulls are ancient and bleached white, while others are recent trophies still shrouded in rotting cheeks, their jellied eyes rolling madly in their sockets. A curved bony tip protrudes from the last skull of its tail, its deadly point smeared with poison.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Behead-Ex-"></a>Behead (Ex)</h4>
<p>A skull ripper is an expert at collecting its favorite trophiesâskulls. Once it has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> a foe, it can attempt to behead the victim with a single gut-wrenching rip of its claws. This attempt is made as part of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check to maintain an existing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pin</a>, and if successful, deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the victim. If this damage is enough to bring the target below 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, the victim must succeed at a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to resist having its head torn from its body, which results in instant death for most creatures. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Dread-Visage-Su-"></a>Dread Visage (Su)</h4>
<p>All creatures within 30 feet that can see a skull ripper must make a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save at the start of their turn in order to avoid becoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a> for 1 round. If the victim recognizes any of the heads affixed to the skull ripper’s body as having once belonged to friends or allies, that victim takes a â4 penalty on the save.</p>
<p>A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the dread visage of that particular skull ripper for 24 hours. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> fear effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<h1>Thorny</h1>
<p class="description">This mass of plant matter has the general shape and build of an oversized dog. Lacking a head of any kind, its bulk is covered in jagged thorns protruding from its fungal surface.</p>

<h4><span id="Thorn_Cluster_Ex"><a name="TOC-Thorn-Cluster-Ex-"></a>Thorn Cluster (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A thorny can shoot a cluster of thorns from its back as a ranged attack against any target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, the target is struck by 1d3 poisoned thorns, each dealing 1d3 points of piercing damage. Each thorn applies a single dose of the thornyâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. A successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> on this attack instead means the target has been struck by four poisoned thorns. A thorny can use this ability every 1d3 rounds.</p>
<h4><span id="Thorny_Hide_Ex"><a name="TOC-Thorny-Hide-Ex-"></a>Thorny Hide (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a thorny is eligible to use its thorn cluster attack, its hide fills with numerous thorns.</p>

<p>Known by many as â<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/vegepygmy">vegepygmy</a> hounds,â these masses of fungal matter dwarf their diminutive <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/vegepygmy">vegepygmy</a> kin, but still maintain a strong sense of loyalty to them. Named for the vicious thorns that adorn their backs, thornies infect their prey with a weak paralytic toxin, making the prey susceptible to capture. Creatures infected by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/russet-mold-cr-6">russet mold</a> while thorny <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> lingers in their systems have a small chance of producing thorny offspring.</p>

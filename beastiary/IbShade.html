<h1>Ib Shade</h1>
<p class="description">The curious ears and flabby lips of this sickly green humanshaped ghostly creature frame its froglike face, yet only empty sockets stare from where its eyes should be.</p>

<h4><span id="Doom_Su">Doom (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature that takes any damage from an Ib shadeâs wracking touch becomes doomed unless it succeeds at a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. A doomed creature gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> condition. An already <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> creature that takes damage from an Ib shade must succeed at a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to avoid becoming damned instead. A damned creature becomes so haunted by the certainty of its own imminent <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/destruction">destruction</a> that it is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> for 1 round and then <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1d6 rounds thereafter. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> curse effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Ghost_Touch_Ex">Ghost Touch (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An Ib shadeâs webbed hands can manipulate solid objects (but not creatures) as if the objects had the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ghost-touch" style="font-style: italic">ghost touch</a> special ability. This allows Ib shades to wield weapons if they desire (although most eschew weaponry in favor of their more dangerous wracking touches) and to work together to carry large objects. An Ib shade uses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> score instead of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> score for determining how much weight it can carry, lift, or drag.</p>
<h4><span id="Voiceless_Ex">Voiceless (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An Ib shade has no voice and cannot speak or take any verbal action as a result. An Ib shade that gains a level in a spellcasting class automatically replaces any verbal components required by its spells with thought components.</p>
<h4><span id="Wracking_Touch_Su">Wracking Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An Ib shadeâs incorporeal touch causes painful wounds that manifest as wracking burns, deep bruises, or, in the case of attacks made against objects or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, crumbling fissures. This damage is treated as bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing, but it also counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>. Against foes who are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> by an Ib shadeâs doom ability (see above), successful melee attacks are treated as confirmed critical hits. An Ib shadeâs wracking touch is a primary touch attack.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate swamp<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or haunting (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Untold eons ago, a strange race of amphibian humanoids (rumored to have descended from the depths of space) built a city of gray stoneânaming it Ibâon the shores of a deep lake to and from which no river or stream flowed. These beings dwelt in Ib for ages, worshiping their deity and performing their own curious rites and rituals until they were slaughtered by humans who were disturbed by the creaturesâ strange appearances and frightening deity. One thousand years later, the ghosts of this slaughtered race rose from the waters of that lake and descended upon a human city, bringing with them a terrible doom that brought death to all and wiped the mighty metropolis from existence, leaving only a swampy shoreline in its wake with the rising of the next sun.</p>
<p>An Ib shade is a nauseating green color. Its hands and feet are webbed and its body limber and lithe, with a sunken belly. The shadeâs face is froglike, with wide, flabby lips, but it has no eyes in its overly large eye sockets. Its ears are long and taper to two distinct points that protrude backward from the skull at an angle, with a third point descending downward to the shoulder in place of an earlobe.</p>
<p>Ib shades are much more violent and dangerous than their living counterparts; while alive, they were mild, aquatic fisherfolk, but as undead they threaten all with vengeful wrath. These creatures have been known to rise up from nearby bodies of water to assault settlements and cities whose denizens have brought harm to the worshipers of the Water Lizard, and in the worst cases, have caught their godâs attention, leading to that siteâs ultimate destruction. Beyond this, Ib shades are content to remain hidden in the shallow waters of the bogs and lakes in which they once dwelt, coexisting in relative peace with animals but taking great and violent offense against intelligent intruders into their domains.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>If the Ib shades had a name for their race back in the days they lived, such a word has long been lost to the gulfs of time. Today, when scholars speak of these creatures, they refer to them as the âbeings of Ib.â In life, they were amphibious creatures with weak frames and slimy, fragile skin. They were not warlike, but rather were content to spend their lives in worship of their god, hunting and fishing for small game, and pursuing idle entertainments. Curiously, they never built their cities underwater, preferring to raise their squat, functional buildings on swampy lakeshores where the ground was firm enough to support stone edifices.</p>
<p>The beings of Ib were relatively peaceful in life and never presented much in the way of ambition or drive to be anything more than simple lake dwellers. The singular exception concerned their worship of the Water Lizard. The beings of Ib were fanatical devotees of the Great Old One, and the construction of intimidating but masterfully carved statues of the deity from strange, sea-green stone was always the first task these amphibious creatures undertook after settling on a lakeshore.</p>
<h3><span id="Beings_of_Ib">Beings of Ib</span></h3>
<p>Living beings of Ib are defined by their class levelsâthey do not have racial <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. All living beings of Ib have the following racial traits. They are Medium-sized <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aberration">aberrations</a>. A being of Ib is a 14-point race.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ability Scores</b>: Beings of Ib are frail and weak, yet profoundly faithful and devoted. They suffer â4 to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> and â2 to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> but gain +4 to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a></li>
<li><b>Type</b>: A being of Ib is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a>. It can move in water without attempting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim">Swim</a> checks and can breathe underwater. It always treats <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim">Swim</a> as a class skill.</li>
<li><b>Senses</b> A being of Ib has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision">darkvision</a> to 60 feet and low-light vision.</li>
<li><b>Special Qualities</b> A being of Ib is amphibious and so is able to survive indefinitely on land.</li>
<li><b>Speed</b>: A being of Ib has a land speed of 20 feet and a swim speed of 30 feet.</li>
<li><b>Amorphous</b>: Although a being of Ibâs body is solid and it cannot adjust its shape, its slimy skin and internal structures (skeleton and organs alike) are strangely composed of the same alien matter. This lack of any real single weak point means that the being of Ib is immune to precision damage (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack">sneak attacks</a>) and critical hits.</li>
<li><b>Voiceless</b>: An Ib shade has no voice and cannot speak or take any verbal action as a result. An Ib shade that gains a level in a spellcasting class automatically replaces any verbal components required by its spells with thought components.</li>
<li><b>Languages</b>: A being of Ib cannot speak, but is entirely capable of learning and understanding languages. The creaturesâ language, Ib, is a combination of hand gestures and facial expressions.</li>

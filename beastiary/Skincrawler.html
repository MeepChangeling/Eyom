<p class="description">What appears to be a heap of freshly flensed skin ripples and flexes; it has a long tendril tipped with a single sharp fingernail.</p>

<h4><span id="Adaptive_Attachment_Ex">Adaptive Attachment (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a skincrawler successfully attaches itself to a creature, it swiftly adapts its coloration and texture to match the creatureâs flesh. Doing so heals any damage it caused with the sting attack it used to attach to the host. When it uses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Freeze-Ex-">freeze</a> ability in conjunction with this, it can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Take-20">take 20</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks to remain hiddenâin most cases, this means a successful DC 27 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check is required to spot a skincrawler attached to a creature. A skincrawler cannot duplicate fur or scales, thus all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks to spot the attached skincrawler on such a host automatically succeed.</p>
<h4><span id="Memory_Lapse_Su">Memory Lapse (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A target struck by a skincrawlerâs sting must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become momentarily befuddled and unaware of its surroundings. This condition does not last long enough for other creatures to take advantage of the victimâs disoriented state of mind, but is long enough for the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Attach-Ex-">attach</a> itself to the target. The affected creature retains no memory of the skincrawlerâs sting attack or of the creature attaching to its body. It perceives sensations through the attached <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> as if the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> were part of its own skin. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Siphon_Vitality_Ex">Siphon Vitality (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Once a skincrawler is attached to a host, it slowly feeds on the victimâs fluids. This deals 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> per day. Since a nightâs rest is enough to heal this damage, the host of a skincrawler can continue to function relatively normally; however, a creature with a skincrawler attached to its body in this manner takes a â2 penalty on all saving throws against effects that cause <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted">exhaustion</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued">fatigue</a>. Furthermore, the host suffers from mild headaches, slightly blurred vision, a nagging feeling of being watched, and other minor but discomforting distractions that impart a â1 penalty on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throws and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom-based</a> skill checks. All of these effects (the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> and the penalties on checks and saves) stack when multiple skincrawlers feed on a single host.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or rash (2â12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Skincrawlers are parasitic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> that feed on the fluids of living hosts. They stalk isolated prey, but due to their mindlessness, skincrawlers do not recognize that feeding on a host already infested by other skincrawlers can swiftly shorten the lifespan of their food source.</p>
<p>When a skincrawlerâs host dies, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> detaches and crawls into the hostâs body through a convenient orifice, whereupon it enters the last stages of its life cycle. As the host decays around it, the skincrawler suffuses the hostâs flesh; 24 hours after the hostâs death, the hostâs skin splits apart into a rash of up to a dozen skincrawlers that then slither away to seek new prey.</p>
<p>When unattached to a host, a skincrawler appears to be a protoplasmic blob of flesh with visible veins and capillaries.</p>
<p>A skincrawler is about 1 foot square in size and weighs 3 pounds.</p>

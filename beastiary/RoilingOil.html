<h1>Roiling Oil</h1>
<p class="description">This viscous heap slides like an inky spill. It’s the color of a starless night sky, and a thick odor permeates the air around it.</p>

<h4><span id="Nauseating_Film_Su"><a name="TOC-Nauseating-Film-Su-"></a>Nauseating Film (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a roiling oil makes a successful slam attack, it coats a portion of its target in a clinging, reeking film. Creatures affected must succeed at a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4+1 rounds. On a successful save, they are instead <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1 round.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> effect. Another creature can take a full-round action to scrape off some of the film and reduce the remaining duration of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> condition by 1 round.</p>
<h4><span id="Rolling_Inferno_Su"><a name="TOC-Rolling-Inferno-Su-"></a>Rolling Inferno (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Roiling oil is both volatile and flammable. Although the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> is immune to fire and electricity damage, any exposure to either energy type, mundane or magical, causes it to ignite in an explosion that deals 5d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects in a 20-foot radius (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 21 half). When lit, a roiling oil loses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseating</a> film ability but its slam attack deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> gains the burn special attack (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 21 negates). Both DCs are Constitution-based.</p>
<p>While ablaze, the roiling oil gives off smoke that creates <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> in the roiling oil’s space and 5 feet beyond. This smoke functions like a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fog-cloud">fog cloud</a> in the range indicated.</p>
<p>Water does not extinguish the flames, but any cold damage or a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gust-of-wind">gust of wind</a> or similar effect smothers the flames. Otherwise, a roiling oil burns for 1 minute before returning to its original state. While the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> is ablaze, any additional fire or electricity damage extends the duration but doesn’t cause additional explosions.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A magical compound of pitch and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Oil-Alchemist-s-Fire">alchemist’s fire</a>, roiling oil is a volatile and dangerous <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a>. It hunts in subterranean tunnels and even city sewer systems and waterways for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animal</a> and vegetable material to consume. Thick, viscous, and resembling a glistening spread of black wax, roiling oil moves slowly across flat surfaces and up walls to find prey it can batter with its greasy pseudopods. When a patch of roiling oil attacks, the process of stretching and shifting its form to strike exposes portions of its interior mass to oxygen. This interaction creates a pungent odor of oil and rancid fat. A roiling oil’s strikes slather its targets in an equally malodorous film capable of overwhelming victims with nausea. A roiling oil prefers to fully coat its prey in this substance before it kills and devours them. Even more dangerous, however, is the fact that creatures attempting to burn away a roiling oil only make it more lethal. Even the smallest spark or flame can turn this voracious ooze into a moving inferno against which only cold or strong wind act as any protection. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> itself feels no pain from the flames and isn’t impeded by them, but such attempts can result in burns to everyone and everything else in the area.</p>

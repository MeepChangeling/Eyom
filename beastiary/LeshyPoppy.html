<p>The intoxicating scent given off by a poppy leshy causes memory loss to those affected by its spores.

<p>This is a cumulative effect, with additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> inflicted by the spore attack extending the period of memory loss by 5 additional minutes in both directions.

<p>Often found near dryad’s trees, in nymph’s groves, and elsewhere close to fey creatures, poppy leshys serve as guardians and friends to creatures from the Fey World.</p>
<p>They do their best to hide from humanoids and other creatures of civilization, but their distinctive perfume often gives them away unless they hide in patches of fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Poppy leshys care for sweet-smelling flora, often but not always poppy plants. They look like small humanoid creatures with flowers for hair and leafy or flowery growths covering their legs and feet. In truth, these leshys do not have legs, but rather use flexible roots to move along the ground or up trees.</p>
<p>These creatures often carry slender rapiers or daggers with them, which they keep hidden among the leaves on the lower half of their bodies. They only rely on these weapons as a last resort, knowing most creatures that attack them can overpower them. If fighting in self-defense, they rely on their innate sleep ability to subdue their opponents and escape.</p>
<p>Some druids and fey creatures use the otherwise peaceful leshys to help neutralize intruders in their groves.</p>
<h3><span id="Growing_a_Poppy_Leshy">Growing a Poppy Leshy</span></h3>
<p>Poppy leshys are usually grown in the early spring, planted with poppy seeds soon to sprout. When first born, a poppy leshy does not have a weapon, but can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> one from available materials given a day and left to its own devices (no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> check required).</p>

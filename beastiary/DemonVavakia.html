<h4><span id="Breath_Weapon_Su">Breath Weapon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once every 1d4 rounds, a vavakia can breathe out a 60-foot cone of green fire that seems to writhe and coil with the tortured shapes of a thousand screaming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghost">ghosts</a>. This green fire comprises countless souls the vavakia has consumed, and these vomited souls consume flesh as surely as they consume sanity. A creature struck by this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> takes 20d6 points of damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 30 half) as the raw <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane</a> power blackens and melts its flesh and skin. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil">Evil</a> creatures take half damage from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>, but good creatures that take any damage from a vavakiaâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> are automatically <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round by the excruciating sensation. In addition, any living creature that takes damage from a vavakiaâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> must also succeed at a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d8 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Wisdom drain</a> as its sanity slips away into madness.</p>
<p>Immediately after the vavakia expels this green soulfire, the wailing flames flow in reverse into the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon">demonâs</a> gullet through its open maw. This restores 1d8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> to the vavakia for each creature that was damaged by its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Wisdom drain</a> element of this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Smoking_Wound_Su">Smoking Wound (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The wounds caused by a vavakiaâs fangs result in terrible, eerie wounds that constantly weep wisps of green smoke rather than blood, a grim manifestation of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon">demonâs</a> effect on a mortal soul. Each time a vavakia bites a creature, it inflicts 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a>. The wounds continue to smoke as long as the victim suffers those <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a>, causing the victim to become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> from the hideous sensation and rank smell of the vapors. An effect that removes this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> condition without restoring the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> only temporarily causes the wounds to stop smokingâthey begin smoking again in 1d6 rounds. Nonliving creatures bitten by a vavakia are immune to its energy-draining bite and do not exhibit smoking wounds. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to remove these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> is DC 25. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Stun_Ex">Stun (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A creature struck by a vavakiaâs tail slap must succeed at a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round.</p>
<p>On a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stun</a> effect lasts for 1d4 rounds on a failed save and 1 round on a successful save. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Abyss)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or warband (1 vavakia plus 2â4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/hezrou">hezrous</a> and 2â8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/vrock">vrocks</a>)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (+2 breastplate, +1 <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy">unholy</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/ranseur">ranseur</a>, other treasure)</p>
<p>Vavakias are immense <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> of great power. Saurian in shape, appetite, and destructive power, they are most often encountered on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, though not as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> conjured by spellcasters to serve, but rather as violent invaders come to the world through tears in reality or portals to the deeper rifts. On the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, a single vavakia is a formidable presence, for the strange <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon">demon</a> is driven to feed on living souls and spread destructionâroles at which it excels.</p>
<p>A vavakia <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon">demon</a> measures 30 feet in length and stands 15 feet tall, weighing in at 6,000 pounds. Vavakias form on the Abyss from particularly cruel mortal souls who, in life, practiced the vile act of extracting, enslaving, and even consuming other souls. When such a sinful creature arrives on the Abyss, it brings with it partially absorbed fragments of souls from its victims, which it incorporates during its horrific transformation into one of the Abyssâs most dangerous forms of demonic life.</p>
<p>Though originally created to serve as living weapons of war, the vavakias have long since established their own presence as Abyssal warlords and conquerors. While some pledge their service to powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lords</a>, most vavakias rule small empires of their own in the Abyss, typically in remote corners infested with jungles, swamps, and other primeval terrains.</p>

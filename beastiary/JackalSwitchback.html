<p>Jackals are curious and cunning observers, able to overcome relatively complex barriers and dangers. They can use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> untrained to bypass simple traps (any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps/">trap</a> with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> DC of 20 or less).

<p>While wolves and big cats draw much of the common folkâs fear and ire, jackals inflict far more damage on farms and herds. Able to digest almost anything, these small predators scavenge and steal with unparalleled skill, bypassing gates, seals, traps, and even doors with ease to plunder chickens, goats, and produce. Utterly fearless, starving packs even prey on far larger and more dangerous creaturesâincluding wolves and humanoids. In harsh winters, packs subsist on grubs and roots, and even eat their own. Switchback jackals grow up to 30 pounds and 2 to 3 feet long.</p>
<p>Switchback jackals mostly make their homes in plains, though they can survive easily in rocky foothills and on marshy coastlines.</p>
<p>They breed in late spring, after 3 weeks of howling hauntingly beautiful mating songs each evening. Pups lose their mottled black-and-white coats after 6 months, growing into their dusty adult coats. During this time, packs are especially aggressive and territorial.</p>

<h4><span id="Chest_Container_Su">Chest Container (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The chest cavity of a clockwork hound can be opened to expose a 6-inch-cube storage area that can hold up to 10 pounds of items. If a contained item is a magical necklace, ring, or <a class="item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones">ioun stone</a>, then the hound gains the benefits of the item as though it were worn, but the hound can benefit from the effects of only one such item at a time (chosen by the person who placed the items inside). A clockwork hound can open or close its chest cavity as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, depositing any items within onto the ground under it.</p>
<h4><span id="Efficient_Winding_Ex">Efficient Winding (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A clockwork hound can function for 2 days per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> every time it is wound (12 days for the typical clockwork hound).</p>
<h4><span id="Expert_Tracker_Ex">Expert Tracker (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The hound gains a +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> checks, and an additional +8 bonus when tracking by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent">scent</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Swift_Bite_Ex">Swift Bite (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a clockwork hound makes a full attack, it can make two bite attacks.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or pack (3â8)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Clockwork hounds are artificial approximations of canine companions that operate much like their living counterparts but never die of natural causes. They can work in packs or alone, in accordance with the instructions imparted by their operators. Whether their operators are alive or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> is of little consequence to these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, which proceed based on the last instructions provided.</p>
<p>Like clockworksoldiers, clockwork hounds have long activity cycles due to the lessened winding requirements of their lighter frames.</p>
<p>Their chest cavities are used to storage goods instead of for reinforcement. They are used primarily for delivery missions, but work equally well as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/retriever">retrievers</a>. Theyâre occasionally used for sentry duty, or more rarely, defense, and are most often seen in the company of similarly tasked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> such as clockwork soldiers and guardians. A clockwork hound stands 2-1/2 feet tall at its shoulders and weighs 300 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Clockwork_Hound_Construction"><a name="TOC-Clockwork-Hound-Construction"></a>Clockwork Hound Construction</span></h3>
<p>The creation of a clockwork hound is a delicate process, requiring fine work in order to provide the necessary space for the houndâs storage bay. The creator of a clockwork hound must start the process with crafted clockwork pieces worth 750 gp.</p>

<p>The bahgra are often referred to as ‘dog folk’ due to their distinctly canine features. Although they stand upright with fully articulate hands, their heads still portray the bestial snout and teeth of wild dogs. They also communicate through barks, growls, and soulful whines, but struggle to make themselves understood in the languages of other races, lacking the ability to make certain sounds and facial expressions.</p>
<p>Generally taller than dwarves, but shorter than humans, bahgra flourish in both temperate and cold environments thanks to their natural fur- the coloration of which can vary as widely as the ethnicities of other humanoid races.</p>
<p>Bahgra possess a cunning intelligence, but most regard them as little more than apex predators and savages. Bahgra make excellent trackers, skilled laborers, and warriors, possessing a natural ‘team’ instinct which makes them well-suited to construction and manufacturing. This trait also manifests during combat, as bahgra excel in pack-based tactics.</p>
<p>Bahgra are 5 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds.</p>

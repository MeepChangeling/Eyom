<p>Gugs are inhuman monstrosities that dwell in the deep places of the world. Whether they were banished to the dark lands by ancient gods or the light-loving races they terrorized, or perhaps were brought to the deep realms by dark powers from some even more inhuman nightmare realm, is unknown, but gugs are loathed by other races for their carnal rites of slaughter.</p>
<p>Gugs are 16 feet tall and weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, but they move with an eerie, unnatural gait as though their limbs contained far too many joints. They can contort and distend their limbs for greater reach or to wriggle easily through impossibly Small passages. Gugs may cling for long hours to cave walls or just within dark side-caverns, lying in wait for prey to stumble too close. Their senses are keen, however, and their joy in the bloody hunt is considerable and gugs who catch the scent of blood may stalk their prey for long days, even venturing at times beyond their caves to dare the bright lands of the surface in search of tasty meat to drag back for their horrific sacrifices.</p>
<p>Gugs are savage fighters when driven by a strong leader, but on their own may flee if brought to fewer than half their hit points, carrying off fresh meat for later feasting if they are able. They can subsist on fungi, slimes, and molds as well as carrion and even undead fleshâparticularly that of ghouls.</p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Gug-Variants"></a>Variants</h3>
<p><b>Elder Gug (+1 CR)</b>: The oldest gugs, living well beyond the normal life span of their kin, develop into wickedly large creatures known as gug elders. Gug elders are larger in stature than their lesser kin, and possess wickedly sharp talons. To represent an elder gug, apply the giant simple template and increase the critical threat range of the gugâs claws to 19â20. <span class="source"><b>Source</b> <a href="http://www.opengamingstore.com/products/pathfinder-campaign-setting-darklands-revisited-pfrpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PCS:DR</a></span></p>
<p><b>Psychic Gug (+1 CR)</b>: Gugs exposed to psychic entities over prolonged periods often exhibit similar powers. The most common method by which a gug develops psychic powers is through an extended period of mental domination, during which the gugâs mind gains rudimentary psychic powers. Psychic gugs gain the following abilities:</p>

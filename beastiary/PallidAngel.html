<h1>Pallid Angel</h1>
<p class="description">This macabre beauty holds her ebon-feathered wings spread behind her. Her skin and clothing are soaked and splattered with blood, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Wine">wine</a>, and other fluids.</p>

<h4><span id="Bloodbath_Su">Bloodbath (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Pallid angels are avatars of slaughter, delighting in the bloody carnality of combat. When a pallid angel kills a creature using a manufactured melee weapon, she can splash its blood (or similar remains) on herself as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, even if itâs not her turn. This grants her 8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> and a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>.</p>
<p>These benefits stack with themselves, to a maximum of 40 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> and a +10 bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>, and they last until 1 minute after the pallid angel last used this ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Hunger_for_Life_and_Death_Su">Hunger for Life and Death (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A pallid angel is healed by both positive and negative energy. In addition, whenever a positive energy or negative energy effect would heal or harm one or more creatures within 30 feet, the pallid angel can consume the energy as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>. The pallid angel regains a number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> equal to the greatest amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> or damage a targeted creature would receive, and no other creatures are affected by the effect. A pallid angel can consume energy this way three times per day.</p>

<p>The average pallid angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.</p>
<p>Created as mockeries of true <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">angels</a>, pallid angels strongly resemble the celestial beings for which they were named, and if cleansed of the stains of their hedonism they can often pass for such goodly creatures.</p>
<p>Pallid angels particularly enjoy such deceptions, taking advantage of gullible mortals to revel in their adulation and spread indulgent ways.</p>
<p>However, unlike true <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">angels</a>, pallid angels are universally female, with bodies resembling those they had or most desired in life.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>, pallid angels have no need to eat or sleep; however, befitting their nature as favored servants of the goddess of indulgence, they seek out and revel in the pleasures of the flesh. Though any act of carnal pleasure is of interest to them, great feasts both mundane and cannibalistic, sexual excesses, and intoxicants of every variety are common pursuits for pallid angels. Most pallid angels also blend their hedonism with enjoyment of milder sensual delights such as massages, luxurious comforts and furnishings, and even long periods of indolent slumber, for less intense acts make the greater pleasures all the more ecstatic by comparison.</p>
<p>In addition to their hedonistic urges, pallid <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">angelsâ</a> love of violence and bloodshed drives them to brutally abuse, and often eventually slay, any innocent unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp. Pallid angels take great pleasure in tormenting hostages and prisoners of war, and they occasionally spare <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> foes for this purpose.</p>
<p>A pallid angel denied such victims eventually sates her violent urges upon her companions and servants.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Pallid angels are often sent in response to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/planar-ally">planar ally</a> spells or <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/called">called</a> by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/planar-binding">planar binding</a> spells; a wise caller is ready to satisfy the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel">angelâs</a> hedonism, such as by casting heroesâ feast for the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel">angelâs</a> exclusive benefit. Pallid angels are often conjured to serve as generals of great armies, particularly those heavy with undeath.</p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">angelsâ</a> role as military leaders, small cults or lone priests might call upon a pallid angel to defend their sanctum from invaders or aid an assault against the forces of good, while hedonistic cults or worshippers occasionally conjure pallid angels simply to share in their pleasures. Pallid angels are sometimes sent to pleasure cults unbidden, especially if such a cult has not yet descended fully into evil; the pallid angel serves as a guide to even more perverse indulgences and ensures the cultâs corruption.</p>

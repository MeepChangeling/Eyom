<p>Cave morays make their lairs underground in abandoned mines, dungeons, or natural occurring caves, usually near corridors, hallways or other areas of high traffic. Its lair is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>, just large enough for its body dug into the walls. Only one cave moray inhabits each <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>.</p>
<p>A typical cave moray cluster contains an equal number of males and females, while a colony is often contains more females than males. Even so, the male cave moray dominates the colony. Mating occurs in the warmer months of the year with a gestation period of about 6 months. Young are born live and depend completely on their mother for nourishment and food until they are about 8 months old. A cave moray is a carnivore and its diet consists of whatever it can kill. Prey is devoured immediately and never stored or saved for later. A typical adult cave moray can go a month or more without eating. A cave morayâs favored tactic is to lie in wait in its cyst-like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> in the wall and attack whenever prey passes nearby. Two or more cave morays usually strike in unison, one from each side of a passage. After an attack, a cave moray recoils into its cyst to strike again.</p>

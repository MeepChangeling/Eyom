<h4><a name="TOC-Poison-Ex-"></a>Poison (Ex)</h4>
<p style="margin-left:20px"> Savage biteâinjury; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 15; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Str</a>; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive saves. </p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Savage-Bite-Ex-"></a>Savage Bite (Ex)</h4>
<p> A devilfish can attack with its savage bite whenever it makes a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. This attack is in place of any other action made with a successful grapple check. The bite threatens a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> on a roll of 18â20, and injects the target with poison as well. </p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Unholy-Blood-Su-"></a>Unholy Blood (Su)</h4>
<p> A devilfishâs blood is infused with fiendish magic. Once per day, as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, a devilfish can emit a night-black cloud of this foul liquid, filling a 20-foot-radius cloud if underwater, or a 20-foot-radius burst on land. In water, the blood provides total <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> for everything but a devilfish (which can see through the blood with ease); on land the slippery blood coats the ground, making the area difficult terrain. The blood persists for 1 minute before fading. Anyone who enters a cloud of the blood in the water or who is within the area of a burst of blood on land must make a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4 roundsâthis save need be made only once per cloud. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. </p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Water-Dependency-Ex-"></a>Water Dependency (Ex)</h4>
<p> A devilfish can survive out of the water for 1 hour, after which it becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued">fatigued</a>. After 2 hours, the devilfish becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted">exhausted</a> and begins to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Suffocation">suffocate</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any aquatic<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p> Although the devilfish superficially resembles a sevenarmed octopus, it is an altogether different creature. Possessing a rudimentary intellect, a devilfish can understand and even speak a few words and phrases in various languages, although when it speaks, it has a tendency to mix languages together, making it somewhat difficult to understand for anyone who doesnât speak all the languages known by the devilfish. </p>
<p> More than those of a mere animal, the devilfishâs intelligence and several of its abilities are gifts from a fiendish legacyâmost sages believe that the original devilfish were once outsiders from the Abyss, and that over the course of thousands of years they became true natives of the Material Planeâs oceans. Rumors of far more intelligent devilfish dwelling in the deepest ocean trenches persist, although if these rumors are true, these deep-dwelling devilfish do not often come to the surface. </p>
<p> A devilfish is 10 feet long and weighs 500 pounds. </p>

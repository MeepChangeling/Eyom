<p>Sheet funguses are flat, sheet-like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> creatures believed to be created by evil priests who experimented with various plants and funguses mixed with dark magic. They resemble tapestries or rugs and use this to their advantage when hunting for food. Sheet funguses are fond of blood and flesh, especially that of humans. Sheet funguses are sometimes found acting as guards in temples dedicated to foul fungus and ooze demons.</p>
<p>A sheet fungus is a flat, sheet thin creature about 6 feet long and 2-1/2 or 3 feet wide. It weighs about 3 pounds. Two small dark circles “sewn” into its design function as eyes.</p>
<p>Sheet funguses press themselves up against walls or floors so as to appear to be nothing more than a wall hanging or rug. When a potential meal wanders too close, the sheet fungus springs out and attempts to envelope the target in its body. A grabbed opponent is held until it dies or until the sheet fungus takes 3/4 or more of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> in damage at which time it usually releases its prey and flees. A hungry sheet fungus will fight to the death however. There is a 5% chance that any creature slain by a sheet fungus returns to life as a free-willed vegepygmy.</p>

<p>A reigon is an aggressive predatory biped that dwells in dark forests away from general civilization, but not so far away that a small band of these creatures can’t go out hunting in the night hours. A reigon’s diet consists of berries, plants, forest game (both large and small), and sometimes humanoids (particularly if a supply, such as a small town or village, is readily available).</p>
<p>Reigons are tribal, territorial, and never associate with creatures outside their own tribe or family (including other reigons). If two reigon tribes move into the same area, a small war usually ensues with the victor claiming rights to the area and any survivors of the defeated side moving on to greener pastures. If a common threat presents itself however, reigon tribes will band together in order to remove said threat before each tribe goes its own way.</p>
<p>A reigon tribe makes its home in thickly wooded areas usually well hidden and out of the way, but fairly close to a natural source of water. Once seated, a tribe rarely moves, unless a new tribe moves into the area and forces them to flee or food and water become extremely scarce. Reigon lairs are simple wooden structures covered with bark, cloth, leaves, and vines.</p>
<p>A reigon stands about 8 feet tall and weighs around 600 pounds. Its entire body, save for its face and palms are covered in thick fur. A reigon generally lives for about 40 years with young reaching maturity around 4 to 6 years of age.</p>
<p>Reigons speak their own guttural language consisting of grunts, growls, and howls.</p>

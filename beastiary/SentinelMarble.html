<p class="description">Crouched on six jointed metal legs, this large humanoid head crafted from polished marble gazes intently with its glowing green eyes.</p>

<h4><span id="Alert_Su"><a name="TOC-Alert-Su-1"></a>Alert (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A marble sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and it possesses the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which it’s keyed. When a marble sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it’s keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a marble sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn’t affect normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a>. A marble sentinel’s creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex"><a name="TOC-Immunity-to-Magic-Ex-2"></a>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A marble sentinel is immune to spells or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> that allow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>, save for spells with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Force">force descriptor</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Paralyzing_Bolt_Su"><a name="TOC-Paralyzing-Bolt-Su-"></a>Paralyzing Bolt (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a marble sentinel can fire a green-hued bolt of energy as a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> out to a maximum range of 30 feet. A creature struck by this ray must succeed at a DC 12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or troop (3â7)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Marble sentinels were prized for their ability not only to detect intruders, but also to restrain them with paralyzing bolts. This ability only lasts temporarily, so the creator or other creature the sentinel is keyed to would have to receive the alert and mobilize her guards to properly subdue and restrain any trespassers.</p>
<h3><span id="Construction">Construction</span></h3>
<p>Though the exact process of creating the base form differs depending on the materials involved, the process of animating sentinels is roughly the same. Each sentinel must be carved or worked to a fine detail before being subjected to spells and magical unguents worth 1,000 gp.</p>

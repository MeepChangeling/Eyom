<p>Witherweeds resemble large patches of dry grass and weeds and are most often found in areas where their natural makeup allows them to blend in with their surroundings. A subterranean version of this monster exists and makes its lair in desolate caves and caverns.</p>
<p>Hidden among the creatureâ€™s body are many long, sinewy strands that it uses to trap its foes. The average witherweed covers an area of 10 square feet, though specimens as large as 60 square feet have been encountered by a few dungeon delvers.</p>
<p>A witherweed has one frond for each HD it possesses (thus, the typical 5 HD witherweed has 5 fronds while a 10 HD witherweed has 10 fronds). </p>

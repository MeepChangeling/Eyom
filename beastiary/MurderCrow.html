<h1>Murder Crow</h1>
<p class="description">This creature appears to be a crow about 4 feet tall. Its feathers are tattered, blood-soaked, and matted against its rotting form. A decaying stench emanates from it as it circles overhead. </p>

<p>Murder crows are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> avians found haunting cemeteries, graveyards, and charnel houses where they feast on the carcasses of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>, and other once living creatures. These creatures are formed in desolate areas where the formless souls of birds condense into a solitary creature â€“ a murder crow. Murder crows attack with their jagged beaks and sinister talons. Rarely does a murder crow face its adversaries on the ground, preferring instead to execute a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/flyby-attack">flyby attack</a>, enhancing this attack with its special eye rake ability.</p>
<p>Murder crows resemble standard crows except that they stand nearly 4 feet tall with a wingspan of 9 feet. Their tattered feathers are black and carry the stench of death. The eyes of a murder crow are bleak and hollow, showing no signs of emotion or life. Murder crows possess an intelligence level similar to that of their living counterparts; however, they have a great level of awareness that allows them to hunt and kill in a much more proficient manner.</p>

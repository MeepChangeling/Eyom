<h1>Karn-Tor</h1>
<p class="description">A saurian humanoid covered in mottled, scaly flesh steps from the surroundings. Draped in worn, bloodstained hides it points its weapons as a trail of saliva begins leaking through rows of hungry, eager fangs.</p>

<h4>Leaping Charge (Ex)</h4>
<p>A karn-tor can jump while charging, allowing it to ignore difficult terrain when it charges. When a karn-tor makes a charge in this way, it deals double damage with its talons or melee weapon.</p>
<p>In addition, a karn-tor can jump through the space of allies without interfering with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a> (or even through the space of an enemy, as long as it succeeds on an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check to move through its space) and can take its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a> attack at any point during its jump, including at the start, in mid-air, or at the end of the jump. Any movement taken while the karn-tor jumps does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> for leaving a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares">threatened</a> square.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, war party (3-12), or tribe (13-80)<br/><b>Treasure</b> NPC gear (battle <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/animals-animal-gear#TOC-Harness">harness</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/shortspear">shortspear</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a>)</p>
<p>The karn-tor are a primitive race of saurian <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> that inhabit the jungles and swamps of warmer moons.</p>
<p>They live in small tribes of hunter-scavengers typically under the command of a powerful warlord chieftain.</p>
<p>While they live simply, they aren’t unintelligent and prove incredibly resourceful in terms of survival and making do with whatever resources they seize during their raids. While they have no way of manufacturing technological items, they have figured out how to use those they can steal from more civilized races when they encounter them. Of course, they are most interested in military weapons such as guns and bombs but steal whatever tech they can during raids. Beyond plundering, they rarely interact with outsiders, including members of their own species.</p>

<p> The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily befriended. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Most pegasi are white, though occasionally one is hatched with conventional horse colors and markings.</p>
<p> The pegasus is, despite its appearance, as intelligent as a human. As such, those who try to train a pegasus to serve as a mount find the pegasus to be recalcitrant and even violent. A pegasus cannot speak, but it understands Common and greatly prefers the company of a good companion. The proper method to convince a pegasus to serve as a mount is to befriend it with diplomacy, favors, and good deeds. A pegasus is generally indifferent to a good-aligned creature, unfriendly to a neutral one, and hostile to an evil oneâbefore a pegasus will serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made helpful via <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy" rel="nofollow">Diplomacy</a> checks or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or no saddle at all, as a regular saddle’s straps interfere with the creature’s wings. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride" rel="nofollow">Ride</a> check. Trained pegasi are not afraid of combat, and the rider does not need to make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride" rel="nofollow">Ride</a> check each round merely to control his mount.</p>
<p> Pegasi lay eggsâthey are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. However, as they are intelligent, good-aligned creatures, selling eggs and young is essentially slavery and is looked down on or outlawed in good societies.</p>
<p> Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life.</p>
<p> A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301â600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601â900 pounds.</p>

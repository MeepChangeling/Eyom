<h4><a name="TOC-Control-Body-Su-"></a>Control Body (Su)</h4>
<p>A shredskin can wrap itself around a corpse (or a corporeal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> it controls using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/command-undead">command undead</a>). When wrapping a host body in this way, the shredskin gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> 14 or the host body’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>, whichever is higher, but cannot use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a> or enshroud abilities which doing so. Attacks targeted at the shredskin deal half damage to it and half damage to the host body; area attacks deal normal damage to both the shredskin and its host. If the host is destroyed, the shredskin unwraps itself as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> on its next turn. A typical Medium corpse has 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> for this purpose, while a Small corpse has 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. A shredskin can only use this ability on a generally humanoid-shaped creature (two arms, one head, humanoid torso) of Medium or Small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Size-Bonus">size</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Enshroud-Ex-"></a>Enshroud (Ex)</h4>
<p>A shredskin that successfully pins a creature can wrap itself around that target like a shirt. The target gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> condition, but the shredskin has neither the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> condition, and can move itself and the target as if it controlled the target’s body. The shredskin deals <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a> damage to the target on its turn each round (no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check needed). Attacking the shredskin while it’s using this ability damages both it and the target as described in the control body ability. The shredskin can release the target as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or pack (2â5)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>A shredskin is a wretched undead creature created either when a humanoid is skinned alive to be preserved as a trophy or otherwise killed in a terrifying way that leaves much of its upper half unharmed, such as being dissolved feet-first in acid. A fragment of the creature’s soul animates the skin and seeks vengeance on those who created it, all the while trying to find a comfortable body for it to use as it did when it was alive. A shredskin may attack on its own and try to squeeze the life out of a living humanoid to use it as a body, or it might control another <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> such as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombie</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghoul</a>, covering it like a morbid costume. In either case, it abandons its borrowed body if it finds a better one or the old one is destroyed. A shredskin is usually recognizable by creatures who knew it in life.</p>
<p>Because it lacks a lower half, a shredskin is 3â4 feet tall and weighs only 10â15 pounds.</p>

<p><b>During Combat</b> Against a single foe the mutah uses <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/flyby-attack">Flyby Attack</a> to sting the opponent, paralyzing them. When facing a large group it uses poison mist on as many enemies as possible, usually beginning with the green mist.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> If the green poison mist does not seem effective or if there are too many enemies, the mutah begins using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> and poison sting liberally, seeking escape.</p>

<p>Each <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weaponâs</a> saving throw (regardless of type) is DC 24 (and is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based). For each color of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> the mutah uses, its face and head turn that particular color. The most common colors of mist and their effects are: Black: Once per day the mutah can use a black mist that causes permanent blindness in an opponent that fails a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Blue</b>: This color of mist can put an enemy to sleep, functioning as the spell of the same name but affecting one creature of up to 15 HD. Creatures within a 10-ft.-radius of the target must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1d4 rounds.</li>
<li><b>Green</b>: This color is the most commonly used and deals 2d6 points of acid damage to the target, causing their eyes to burn and temporarily blinding a creature for 2d4 rounds or until washed out with water (a full round action that provokes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>). A successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save halves the damage and reduces the blindness to 1 round. Everyone within a 10-ft.-radius of the target takes 2d6 points of acid damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save for half damage).</li>
<li><b>Red</b>: The mutah selects one target and makes a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>. On a hit the target takes 2d6 worth of fire damage and everyone within a 10-ft.-radius of the initial target takes 1d6 worth of fire damage. This otherwise functions as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon">splash weapon</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save for half damage).</li>
<li><b>Yellow</b>: This mist paralyzes a target that fails a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. Those within the a 10-ft.-radius of the target must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1d4 rounds.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Scintillating_Skin_Sp">Scintillating Skin (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>Due to the rapidly changing colors of its skin, the mutah gains a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus">deflection bonus</a> to AC equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any warm water<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Mutah look like a large eel with large crests on its head and two fins that function like small wings. The tail is tipped with a poison stinger. The body of the mutah is narrow but muscular, with linear organs running through the first half of the body. Mutah breathe air so they come up to breathe frequently. An average mutah can stay underwater for about five minutes. A mutahâs skin changes color at random, with the exception of its head, face, and largest crest, which change to match the color of poison mist that the creature is about to use. The changing of skin color, the poison sting, and the variety of breath weapons are the result of beneficial organisms that live inside the mutah.</p>
<p>Mutah are omnivorous, eating mostly fish and other seafood but occasionally preying on a small land animal, such as a pig or a sheep; it uses its sting to paralyze prey and then carries the food to a safe place to eat. A mutah has no teeth; instead it crushes food against bony jaw ridges before muscle action forces the swallowed material down the throat. An average adult mutah is about 20 feet long and weighs about 500 pounds.</p>

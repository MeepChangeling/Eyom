<h4><span id="Firm_Grip_Ex">Firm Grip (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The giant starfish excels at <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> prey, and gains a +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> checks (rather than the standard +4 bonus most monsters gain as a result of having the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a> ability).</p>
<h4><span id="Slow_Regeneration_Ex">Slow Regeneration (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A giant starfish has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> but heals very slowly, regaining a number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> each hour equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (11 hp per hour for the typical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant">giant</a> starfish). <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Acid">Acid</a>, cold, or fire damage suppresses this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> for 24 hours.</p>
<h4><span id="Stomach_Ex">Stomach (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The giant starfish can invert its stomach to attack prey up to 20 feet away. The hook-lined opening to the starfishâs stomach is a primary attack that deals piercing damage. If a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant">giant</a> starfish successfully grapples a foe with its stomach, it gains the benefit of the fast swallow universal monster rule and can swallow the target immediately rather than waiting until the start of its next turn. It does not trigger a fast swallow effect if it grapples a foe with a slam attack.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any coastlines or oceans<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or cluster (3â10)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>The giant starfish dwells along coastlines and in other shallow marine areas. The undersides of each of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant">giant</a> starfishâs arms are lined with thousands of small tube feet that propel it along and aid in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> and pinning its prey. The tube feet at the end of the arms are also sensory organs, detecting scents and textures. The starfish moves via a water vascular system, drawing in ocean water and pumping the water throughout its body and out to its tube feet. Because of this, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant">giant</a> starfish is highly dependent on water to remain mobile and alive.</p>
<p>The giant starfish can be an active <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/hunter">hunter</a>, relentlessly attacking marine mammals and coastal avian life alike, but just as often it lies in wait along the waterâs edge for its prey to venture into reach. When attacking, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant">giant</a> starfish latches on with up to three of its arms and attempts to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pin</a> its opponent. It then extends its stomach outside of its inner cavity in order to begin digesting the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> creature. The giant starfishâs stomach can also shoot out as an elongated tubelike stalk to strike potential prey up to 20 feet away. When the series of barbed hooks at the end of the stomach stalk catch the targeted creature, the starfish begins to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Pull-Ex-">pull</a> it closer, in order to more thoroughly secure its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Meal">meal</a> with its multiple arms. A giant starfish can have anywhere from five to 24 arms, and while the total number of arms can result in a wildly differentlooking creature, the number of limbs has no effect on its statistics since a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant">giant</a> starfish of any size can attack with only up to three of its limbs at a time.</p>
<p>A giant starfish typically measures 15 feet in diameter and weighs 800 pounds.</p>

<h1>Fyr</h1>
<p class="description">This small, goat-headed humanoid has large backward curving horns, goat-like legs, a small bushy tail, and a human torso. Except its arms and hands, thick brown fur covers its entire body. It is heavily adorned with rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other such trinkets.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Weapon-Attunement-Su-"></a><b>Weapon Attunement (Su)</b></h4>
<p>Fyrs have a mystical ability to attune themselves with any weapon they wield. A weapon held by a fyr functions as a masterwork item (gaining a +1 bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>) as long as the fyr wields it. This bonus does not stack with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement bonus</a> gained from magical weapons, or the bonus gained from a masterwork weapon. This bonus is included in the statistics block above.</p>

<p>Fyr are satyr-like creatures that make their homes in the mountainous wilds and dense forests in well-secluded places such as caves or caverns or under a covering of thick branches and giant leaves. They are a solitary and nomadic race, rarely staying in one place for much longer than a few months before moving on. Though always on the move, a fyr can acclimate itself to its surroundings very quickly. Most encounters are with a solitary creature or a solitary creature and its animal companions.</p>
<p>Fyrs are on good terms with gnomes, druids, treants, elves, and halflings, and often trade goods with them or aid them in times of need. Fyr are master jewelers, and their trinkets and baubles are highly sought after by some of the more civilized races that appreciate fine jewelry. These fey tolerate humans and dwarves and likewise trade with them when they near a human settlement or dwarven stronghold. Fyr dislike orcs, goblins, bugbears, and other goblinoids, and avoid contact with them.</p>
<p>Fyrs prefer to avoid combat if possible, but if their homeland or comrades are threatened, they attack. Fyrs use their natural ability to hide themselves in their terrain and attack from surprise. Most of the time a fyr attacks by butting with its horns, but some prefer a âless animalisticâ form of combat and use weapons in combat. Favored weapons include a small longsword, club, hand axe, and dagger. A fyr does not hesitate to retreat if the tide of battle turns against it and usually employs <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/pass-without-trace">pass without trace</a> so it can escape without being tracked. If encountered with its animal companions, the fyr directs them in combat against its foes.</p>

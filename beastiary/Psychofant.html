<p>Thick gray feathers wrap around the plump body of an upright, flightless avian creature. Its wings constantly remain pinned to its side as it waddles on its short, stubby duck-like feet.</p>
<p>The typical psychofant is a squat, broad avian creature covered with dull gray feathers, a dark beak, and wings incapable of flight. It measures 2-1/2 feet in length from beak to tail. Slime coats its feathers, while its oversized belly hangs close to the ground, where it sometimes picks up powdery snow and ice from the underlying glacial surface. Psychofants despise warm temperatures and humid conditions. Perhaps symbolic of being proverbially left out in the cold, the beasts always dwell in chilly, dry environments such as taigas, tundra, and ice caps. They typically stake out a broad territory within their habitat where they intermingle with the indigenous animals. Their dichotomous relationship toward sentient creatures causes them to outwardly avoid them, while their subconscious mind yearns for their attention. They harbor the faint hope a worthy benefactor may reverse their disgusting metamorphosis with extremely powerful magic and return them to their original form. However, the preceding compulsion never applies to other psychofants, as they cannot bear to share the proverbial spotlight with another egotist.</p>

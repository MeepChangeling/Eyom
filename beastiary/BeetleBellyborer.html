<h1>Beetle, Bellyborer</h1>
<p class="description">Slightly larger than a human’s fist, this beetle possesses a collection of tentacles that writhes just behind its over-sized mandibles. Its wings flutter as it hisses at you.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a bellyborer beetle can bore into the abdomen of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> creature and attach itself to the creature’s spine, where it begins laying eggs and transmits a telepathic <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a> (DC 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> negates) to retreat to a more private place to incubate the beetle’s young. If the target succeeds in its save to resist this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a>, the bellyborer beetle’s neurotoxin becomes muddled and diffused, forcing the host creature to make an additional DC 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save each round at the beginning of its turn. With each failed save, the host becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a>, as the condition, until the beginning of its next turn. A target that fails any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save contracts the beetle’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>.</p>
<p>A bellyborer beetle infestation can be removed with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease">remove disease</a> (requiring a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check) or a successful DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> check. Failing this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> check by 5 or more deals 1d6 hp damage to the host.</p>

<p>Every five days until the infestation is cured or the host dies, 1d6 mature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/beetle">beetles</a> emerge from the victim, dealing 1 additional point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> damage for each new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/beetle">beetle</a>.</p>

<p>Bellyborer beetles are dangerous parasites that seek warm flesh to inhabit, preferably with ready access to a creature’s nervous and digestive system. Their toxic saliva helps dissolve the neural tissue of the host and convert it into vital enzymes for the production of its eggs, which it implants in the lining of the host’s digestion tract, where they incubate and then <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> forth after hatching. New bellyborers always seek a new host and do not re-infest the host in which they were birthed.</p>
<p>Bellyborer beetles are often found in large number within the wounded flesh of large mammals, but they also congregate in open wounds of smaller mammals, too.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that they actually prefer humanoid hosts, since humanoids tend to frequently move into different biomes with an abundance of potential new hosts for bellyborers’ offspring. Bellyborers do not need to be engorged in a host to reproduce, as they can lay their eggs in any warm, wet environment. Bellyborer egg clutches usually consist of 100-500 eggs.</p>

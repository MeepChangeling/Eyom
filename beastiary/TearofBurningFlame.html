<h1>Tear of Burning Flame</h1>
<p class="description">A slithering blob of amoeba-like protoplasm shines with flame, warping the air around it in a searing mirage.</p>

<p>As part of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a> attack, a tear of burning flame can attempt to forcefully inhabit a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> victimâs body.</p>
<p>A DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save resists this intrusion and renders immunity to that <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze’s</a> symbiosis ability for 24 hours; failure means the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> spends a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> inhabiting its new host. Once absorbed, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> grants incredible boons to willing hosts, or slowly incinerates unwilling victims.</p>
<p>A willing host ceases aging, is sustained as if wearing a ring of sustenance, and becomes sterile. He or she also gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fire">fire</a> subtype, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>, and telepathic abilities of the tear of burning flame. A host can use the creatureâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, with save DCs calculated using the hostâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> score, although daily limits of powers still apply. Damage dealt to the host body does not harm the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a>.</p>
<p>Unwilling victims are granted no abilities, and are instead tortured with searing pain. Victims take automatic burn damage each round, and must succeed on a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4 rounds. While this occurs, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> may telepathically appeal to the host for control of the body to prevent further pain (treat control as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-jar">magic jar</a>, with no receptacle required). The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> may vacate the body of a host as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, bursting forth in a protoplasmic expulsion, dealing double burn damage. A victim may attempt to expel the creature from his or her body as a full-round action with a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save, but each attempt results in automatic burn damage from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a>, and damage from the creatureâs violent exit if successful (as if the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> had left voluntarily). <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse">Remove curse</a> expels the creature, if the caster succeeds on a DC 21 caster level check.</p>
<p>The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or pack (2â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>First spawned by a primordial godling, these fiery, parasitic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> contain a portion of the creatureâs essence and foul sentience. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> hunt ceaselessly, seeking to force their amoebic protoplasm into the bodies of humanoids to turn their hosts to the service of their master, whether the hosts are willing or not. After many years of possession, the host and the symbiote may undergo a strange metamorphosis, exploding into a horrible light that catalyzes into a being known as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/shining-child">shining child</a>.</p>

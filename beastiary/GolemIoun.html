<h1>Golem, Ioun</h1>
<p class="description">This four-armed metal construct has a roughly humanoid shape, with the obvious exception of a missing head. Veins of brass overlay a body of meshed platinum and silver, with intricate circular grooves visible above, below, and between its twin sets of arms.</p>

<h4><span id="Gem_Receptacle_Ex">Gem Receptacle (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An ioun golem can socket up to six ioun stones into itself. Each socketed stone grants the golem full access to the stoneâs abilities and benefits, as though it were orbiting the ioun golem. An ioun golem gains 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> for each <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones">ioun stone</a> socketed in this manner, to a maximum of 60 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> if all slots are filled. Temporary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> last for 24 hours and each socket can grant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> only once per day, regardless of how many ioun stones are placed within it during that period. A socketed <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones">ioun stone</a> cannot be independently targeted, but it can still be the subject of a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Steal">steal</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder">sunder</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> performed against the ioun golem.</p>
<p>Socketing or removing an ioun stone is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An ioun golem is immune to any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> that allows <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shatter">shatter</a> spell deals damage to an ioun golem as though it were a crystalline creature (no saving throw) and has a 25% chance of dislodging a random socketed <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones">ioun stone</a>, causing the gem to fall into an adjacent square.</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/telekinesis">telekinesis</a> spell can be used to attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check to remove a socketed <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones">ioun stone</a>. The ioun golem takes a â10 penalty to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> against such an attempt.</li>
<li>A mageâs disjunction spell causes all socketed ioun stones to turn dull gray and become useless for the next hour (no saving throw).</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Ioun_Attraction_Su">Ioun Attraction (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The innate connection an ioun golem has with ioun stones manifests in a specialized aura of magnetic force. Ioun stones orbiting a creature that are brought within 60 feet of an ioun golem are immediately targeted by a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Steal">steal</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> using the ioun <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus">CMB</a>. Targets of this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> receive a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> to their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> against this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Steal">steal</a> attempt. Any stones successfully stolen in this manner are pulled toward the ioun golem and can be immediately socketed into an available receptacle as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. If no free receptacles are available, the pilfered ioun stones orbit the ioun golem, granting the golem their powers as normal. Unattended or protected stones, such as those embedded in the skin or held inside a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/wayfinder-standard">wayfinder</a>, are unaffected by this aura. An ioun golem can suppress and reactivate this aura as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Ioun_Surge_Su">Ioun Surge (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, an ioun golem can channel the energy of one of its socketed ioun stones, as long as that stone is not dull gray. This manifests as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-missile">magic missile</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> 16th), except it conjures five missiles, each dealing 2d6+1 points of force damage. When the ioun golem uses this ability, the selected socketed <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones">ioun stone</a> becomes dull gray for the next 1d4+1 rounds.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (up to six ioun stones)</p>
<p>Ancient empires employed numerous different types of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golems</a> in their defense and also as members of mechanized workforces.</p>
<p>Immense quantities of alchemically purified brass, platinum, and silver are required for the construction of an ioun golem. Silver forms much of the base frame, while platinum is poured into areas intended as gem receptacles.</p>
<p>Brass filigree overlays the body, conducting the magical energy necessary to animate the golem. Occasional lines of vibrant magical energy are visible along the golemâs brass sections when viewed with effects such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/analyze-dweomer">analyze dweomer</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic">detect magic</a>, or similar effects.</p>
<p>A typical ioun golem stands 12 feet tall and weighs close to 1,200 pounds.</p>
<p>Ioun golems are the pinnacle of research into the esoteric science known as electro-thaumaturgy. This mysterious art allowed for the transmission and broadcast of pure arcane energy. The golemâs body is crafted to store magical energy and can even siphon further energy from other battery-like magical devices.</p>
<p>An ioun <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem’s</a> frame has enough energy to keep itself animate for centuries without rest, but the addition of an <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones">ioun stone</a>, even for a moment, extends the active cycle of an ioun <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> into millennia. By quickly siphoning the innate power of a socketed <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones">ioun stone</a>, the golem can unleash the stored energy as a blast of magical force.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>A great cataclysm destroyed most ioun golems. Those that survived are now scattered across the world, either long inactive without access to their ioun stone batteries or ceaselessly fulfilling their last orders.</p>
<h3><span id="Construction">Construction</span></h3>
<p>The art of crafting an ioun golem is almost entirely lost to time. What few manuals remain on the subject of constructing an ioun golem may be found only in the most secure or lost ruins, if any survive at all. Should adventurers discover some long-forgotten instruction manual, they learn that an ioun golem is built from 2,000 pounds of the finest brass, silver, and platinum, costing an extravagant 70,000 gp in raw materials alone. Six unique ioun stones must be provided during the construction, though these stones are not consumed in the attempt.</p>

<h1>The Grim White Stag</h1>
<p class="description">This moon-pale stag stands 30 feet tall at the shoulder. Its antlers are living saplings, and green vines grow around its legs. Despite its incredible size, it moves with supernatural grace. Its huge eyes gleam with intelligence, and its entire bearing is that of a mighty and noble creature.</p>

<p>The Stag can make a distinctive call that can be heard for miles. All who worship the god it serves immediately recognize the sound and know the direction and general <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/distance">distance</a> to it.</p>

<p>Once per day, the Stag can shed fragments of its antlers, creating up to 18 +1 shortspears, +1 spears, or +1 longspears in any combination (or substitute five +1 arrows or +1 crossbow bolts for each <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/spear">spear</a>). These weapons retain their magic for 18 minutes, after which they become common weapons made of antler.</p>

<p>The Stag lies down and dies to begin the âcastingâ of this ability, its body becoming a magical feast feeding up to 18 creatures. At the next sunrise, it returns to life with full <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>.</p>

<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p> The Grim White Stag doesnât need to eat but enjoys a few bites of the rich grass, wild berries, hay, corn cobs, and other vegetable matter often fed to domesticated herds. He normally only eats to be polite or (though more so in the ancient days than now) to show he accepts an offering made by worshipers. He recognizes that his strength can easily harm others, including plant life; he is cautious when moving through forests so as to not crush trees with the force of his passage. Most natural forest creatures possess an instinctual understanding of the Great White Stag and move aside as it passes, typically meaning that only unwary monsters, oblivious hunters, and others with no right to be in the forest fall as accidental victims to the heraldâs passage. </p>

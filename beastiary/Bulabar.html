On a failed save, the object is reduced to 1 hit point and gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken">broken</a> condition. Using this ability on an already broken object has no effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based and includes a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>.</p>

<p>Bulabars are the tinkers of the Plane of Faerie, thought to personify the evolution of tool use in nature. Fascinated by mechanical devices of all sorts, they frequently wander the landscape looking for novel ideas, or else set up schools and laboratories where they can research their findings and uncover new ways for machines to better their lives.</p>
<p>While other races sometimes resent the bulabarsâ tendency to disassemble or prod curiously at any device they donât understandâincluding those owned by strangersâ bulabarsâ good-natured penchant for teaching others, as well as fixing broken items for the sheer joy of it, makes them welcome in most settlements.</p>
<p>The main exception to bulabarsâ happy-go-lucky attitude is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/gremlins">gremlins</a>. Bulabars despise the problematic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>, especially the machine-destroying <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/gremlins/gremlin-vexgit">vexgits</a>, and attempt to exterminate them whenever possible. This racial hatred is only compounded by the fact that many scholars from other races believe that bulabars may be related to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/gremlins">gremlins</a> themselves, an insult thatâs caused more than one academic gathering to devolve into an unscholarly brawl.</p>
<p>Though they have an uncanny ability to target the weak points of their enemiesâ weapons and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, bulabars hate seeing a useful mechanism broken, and are quick to repair any damaged items as soon as hostilities have ended.</p>
<p>More often, bulabars prefer to attack from afar with ranged weapons or alchemical items they can throwâthe more unusual, the betterâ and those bulabars with the opportunity to study <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">alchemists</a>, gunslingers, and other such adventurers often take levels in those classes themselves.</p>
<p>The average bulabar is 2 feet tall and weighs 20 pounds. Most bulabars canât bear to be parted from their tools and instruments for even a short time, and can usually be found wearing bandoliers, backpacks, and utility belts crammed with useful devices and spare parts.</p>

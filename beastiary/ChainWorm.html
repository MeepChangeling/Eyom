<p>Chain worms are subterranean predators with an insatiable appetite for meat. The creature has a particular fondness for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf" target="_blank">dwarf</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome" target="_blank">gnome</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/bugbear" target="_blank">bugbear</a> flesh. Chain worms often build their nests near communities of these creatures so their food supply is readily available. Though not particularly fond of cold or damp weather, a chain worm can be found just about anywhere as its chitinous body offers it ample protection against less than friendly environments.</p>
<p>A chain wormâs nest is a hole or tunnel littered with rocks, bones, refuse, and debris, and often located on a rocky outcropping or ledge making it inaccessible to most creatures. Any valuables found in its lair are simply the remains of a previous meal that the chain worm couldnât digest or didnât bother eating.</p>
<p>Chain worms stand nearly 6 feet tall and are about 10 feet long with silver carapaces and dull silver legs. Their heads sport oversized dull black mandibles that constantly drip brownish-gray saliva. Its tail stinger is about a foot long and black (as it ages, its tail stinger changes to dull gray).</p>
<p>A chain worm lies in wait for a meal, attacking whenever its target comes within range. It attacks using either a nasty bite or by curling its rear body forward and stinging with its tail stinger. If a chain worm grabs a foe in its mandibles, it holds it and repeatedly stings it until it is dead.</p>

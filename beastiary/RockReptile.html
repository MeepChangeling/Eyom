<p>A rock reptile is a 5-foot long chameleon-like lizard that lairs in rocky areas such as caves and outcroppings. It is fond of darkness and only leaves its seclusion when it is ravaged by hunger. Its chameleon-like hide allows it to blend with its surroundings where it is often mistaken for a pile of rocks.</p>

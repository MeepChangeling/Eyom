<p><b>Environment</b> any land (Plane of Fire)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, team (3â6), squad (11â20 plus 2 sergeants of 3rd level and 1 leader of 3rdâ6th level), or clan (30â100 plus 50% noncombatants plus 1 sergeant of 3rd level per 20 adults, 5 lieutenants of 5th level, and 3 captains of 7th level)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (masterwork scale mail, masterwork warhammer, light hammer, other treasure) </p>
<p> A proud and hardworking race from the Plane of Fire, azers toil in their bronze and brass fortresses, always ready for their long, simmering war against the efreet. Azers live in a society where every member knows his place. Born into a particular duty, usually the trade of his father or mother, an azer continues this task his entire life. A caste system further keeps azer society in line. Nobles, ruling without question, wear decorated brass kilts as their symbol of caste, while merchants and business proprietors wear stout bronze. Copper kilts designate the working class, made up of servants, artisans, and laborers. </p>
<p> Able to channel heat through metal weapons and tools, azers almost never use nonmetallic weapons, and usually engage in close melee rather than using ranged attacks. Azers frequently take prisoners, bringing them back to their fortresses and forcing them to labor for a year and a day. </p>
<p> The legendary City of Brass boasts an azer population over half a million strong. Most of these unfortunate azers live a life of servitude to their efreet masters. Azers subjected to this slavery still perform their duties without question, preferring to wait out their contracts or hoping their masters die or get overthrown. A dedication to order burns strong in this race, to the extent that some enslaved azers act as taskmasters over their own kin. Beyond the City of Brass, azers are free to live their own lives, often in other planar metropolises crafting goods, selling wares, and running taverns. </p>
<p> Azers look strikingly similar to one another to the unfamiliar eye. They are 4 feet tall, but weigh 200 pounds. </p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Caster-Link-Ex-"></a><b>Caster Link (Ex)</b></h4>
<p>When a soul eater is summoned, it creates a mental link between itself and its conjurer. If the soul eaterâs assigned target (see find target ability, below) dies before the soul eater can drain its soul, or if the soul eater is defeated by its target (but not slain), it returns to its conjurer at full speed and attacks her. While the soul eater and the conjurer are on the same plane (regardless of plane-traveling interruptions), it can use its find target ability to locate its conjurer.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Find-Target-Su-"></a><b>Find Target (Su)</b></h4>
<p> When a soul eaterâs conjurer orders it to find a creature, it can do so unerringly, as though guided by a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/locate-creature"><i>locate creature</i></a> spell that has no maximum range and is not blocked by running water. The conjurer must have seen the desired target and must speak the targetâs name.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Soul-Drain-Su-"></a><b>Soul Drain (Su)</b></h4>
<p>If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> damage from a soul eaterâs claw attacks equals or exceeds an opponentâs actual <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> score, rendering the victim <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a>, the soul eater can devour that creatureâs soul as a standard action that provokes an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. This attack kills the victim. The dead victim can resist having her soul eaten by making a (DC 17) <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save; success means she is still dead, but can be restored to life normally. If she fails this save, her soul is consumed by the soul eater. A victim slain in this manner cannot be returned to life with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/clone"><i>clone</i></a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead"><i>raise dead</i></a>, or reincarnation. She can be restored to life via <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection"><i>resurrection</i></a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-resurrection"><i>true resurrection</i></a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle"><i>miracle</i></a>, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish"><i>wish</i></a>, but only if the caster can succeed on a DC 30 caster level check. If the soul eater is killed within 120 feet of its victimâs corpse, and the victim has been <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> for no longer than 1 minute, the victimâs soul returns to her body and restores her to life, leaving her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> and at â1 hit point. This is a death effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Wisdom-Damage-Su-"></a><b>Wisdom Damage (Su)</b> </h4>
<p> A creature hit by a soul eaterâs claw must succeed on a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> damage. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any Outer Plane (Abaddon)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Summoned forth from the inky swamps of Abaddon, a soul eater is an extraplanar entity devoid of emotion or reason and possessing a hunger that may only be sated by devouring the souls of the living. The very nature of a soul eater makes it an ideal and terrifyingly efficient tool of death, and it is for this reason they are often conjured by vile spellcasters pursuing morbid agendas. Even when not seeing to the heinous commands of a sinister magic user, the soul eater prowls and hunts, constantly seeking living souls upon which to gorge itself.</p>

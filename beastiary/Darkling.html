<h1>Darkling</h1>
<p class="description">This hideous grey brute can easily be mistaken for a troll. But the similarity stops there. A sharp intelligence resides behind its eyes and in its menace. A crude, dark grey stone battleaxe is its favored weapon of torment.</p>

<h4><span id="Blood_Healing_Su"><a name="TOC-Blood-Healing-Su-"></a>Blood Healing (Su)</span></h4>
<p>If a darkling spends a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a> licking the blood of a recent victim off its stone <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/axe-battle">battleaxe</a> or its claws, it gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a> 3 for 2 rounds. A darkling can heal up to a maximum of 20 hp/day (double its current HD) in this manner. This action does not provoke an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Feystone_Battleaxe"><a name="TOC-Feystone-Battleaxe"></a>Feystone Battleaxe</span></h4>
<p>A darkling wields crude tools made from stone and worked in a way that only the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> know how. A mundane large feystone <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/axe-battle">battleaxe</a> cost 10 gp, weights 18 lbs, grants a -2 penalty on attacks, grants a +2 bonus when attempting to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder">sunder</a>, deals 2d8-1+<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Str</a> modifier damage, deals double damage on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>, has a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> of 7, and has 7 hp.</p>
<h4><span id="Flicker_Sp"><a name="TOC-Flicker-Sp-"></a>Flicker (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A darkling can turn <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> for 1 round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> ends if the darkling attacks any creature (see <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility">invisibility</a>). This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Planar_Knowledge_Ex"><a name="TOC-Planar-Knowledge-Ex-"></a>Planar <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (Ex)</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (planes) is a class skill for a darkling. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (local) is not a class skill.</p>
<h4><span id="Snow_Spray_Sp"><a name="TOC-Snow-Spray-Sp-"></a>Snow Spray (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A 30 ft cone of snow sprays out from a darklingâs fingertips. All creatures within the area of effect take 5d4 points of cold damage and are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> for 1 round. Creatures that succeeds a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save (DC 13) take half damage and are not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a>. The DC for this ability is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold forest (Plane of Shadows)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, fear (1-2 plus 4-8 dull <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/mite">mites</a>)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (+1 feystone <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/axe-battle">battleaxe</a>, other treasure)</p>
<p>When parents warn their children about evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> that will steal them and eat their eyes, they are describing the darkling. Named for the darkness in its heart as well as the dark maliciousness by which it kills and thrives, a darkling enjoys the taste of blood of anything it has wounded. When it licks the blood of its victim from its feystone <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/axe-battle">battleaxe</a>, the victimâs life comes rushing into the darklingâs body closing any wounds it sustained. For this reason, a darkling will keep a creature alive in its lair to supply it with healing blood.</p>
<p>A darkling stands about 8 feet tall and weighs about 600 pounds.</p>

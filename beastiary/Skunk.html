<h4>Musk (Ex)</h4>
<p>Up to twice per day, a skunk can spray a stream of noxious musk at a single target within 10 feet as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. With a successful ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, the creature struck by this spray must make a DC 11 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4 rounds and then <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1d4 minutes by the horrific stench. A successful save reduces the effect to only 1d4 rounds of being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a>. A creature cannot use the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-">scent</a> ability as long as it is affected by this musk. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based, and includes a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>.</p>

<p>These small mammals are well known to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> and forest creatures alike, with their distinctive black-and-white-striped markings and infamous scent glands. Creatures like big <a href="cat">cats</a> or <a href="wolf">wolves</a> that normally would make a meal of such a small creature give skunks plenty of space, for they have learned well that the combination of black and white on a skunk’s back equates to a hideously overpowering stench.</p>

<h4><span id="Deadlights_Su">Deadlights (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a gator ghoul can cause a 60 ft. cone of bright light to emit from its eyes for up to 1 minute. All living creatures in the area must succeed a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> as long as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/light">light</a> shines on them, unable to move or take any actions. A creature so affected can attempt a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save on its turn as a full round action to break out of the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daze">daze</a>. This <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daze">daze</a> effect is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken">broken</a> the round the creature takes damage from any source. A creature that succeeds its initial saving throw is immune to the deadlights of that gator ghoul for the next 24 hours. A gator ghoul can stop this ability as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> on its turn, and can use this ability three times per day. This is a mind-influencing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect, and the save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> based.</p>
<h4><span id="Death_Roll_Ex">Death Roll (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a gator ghoul succeeds a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check against an opponent of its size or smaller, it deals bonus damage and knocks its victim <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>.</p>
<p>This creature resembles a bipedal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/Alligator">alligator</a> with luminous eyes. Its skin is grayish and hangs loosely from the bone in places.</p>
<p>Crocodilians are among the animals that most commonly eat humanoidsâtheir habitats often overlap, and alligators and crocodiles are masters of stealth in the water. On rare occasions, a crocodile might eat a humanoid that has indulged in a similar repastâa cannibal. Crocodilians that die with a cannibal still in their guts may rise as a gator ghoul, a reptilian undead horror that craves the flesh of humanoids above all other things.</p>
<p>Gator ghouls remain in the habitats they did when they were alive, but shun the company of live crocodilians. They emerge on dark and foggy nights to find humanoid prey, and are not shy about entering settlements or even buildings to do so. The light that shines from their eyes while they hunt mesmerizes and incapacitates, leaving a victim helpless until the gator ghoul sinks in its fangs. The scenes of gator ghoul kills are grisly affairs, with blood splattered and limbs torn asunder by their awful death roll.</p>
<p>True ghouls keep their distance from gator ghouls; the larger undead are barely sapient and decidedly antisocial. Gator ghouls do not hesitate to eat other undead as well, although they disdain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeletons</a> for meatier fare. They are challenging from the perspective of necromancers to control, as they are stubborn and gluttonous at the best of times. If two gator ghouls cross paths, they will usually fight to the death, the weaker being killed and eaten by the stronger.</p>

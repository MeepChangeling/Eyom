<h1>Amalgamite Swarm</h1>
<p class="description">A scuttling mass of metallic bugs surges forward. These insect-like automatons have sharp pincers and are formed from minute shards and splinters of metal.</p>

<h4><span id="Acid_Spit_Ex">Acid Spit (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Each round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, an amalgamite swarm can emit a stream of acid at one target within 10 feet dealing 2d6 acid damage as a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>. Amalgamite swarms are immune to this acid. An amalgamite swarm with 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> or less cannot use this ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Dispersion_Ex">Dispersion (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, an amalgamite swarm can disperse, spreading itself across a 30-foot cube. While dispersed, it deals no damage and can’t use its other special abilities until it reforms. A dispersed amalgamite swarm can make stealth checks even without <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> or when being directly observed, and when dispersed it gains a +10 bonus on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks and does not take increased damage from area effects as normal for being a swarm. Reforming into its normal swarm form takes 1 minute, and while reforming its bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks is reduced to +5.</p>
<h4><span id="Reassemble_Ex">Reassemble (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Damaged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a> of an amalgamite <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> remain animated and still pose a threat to enemies. These smaller components effectively become a companion swarm of Fine-sized creatures (AC 21, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> 21, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a> 18 (+3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dex</a>, +0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor</a>, +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Size-Bonus">size</a>); <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 0; <b>Immune</b> weapon damage) occupying the same space as the Tiny-sized creatures comprising the swarm, with its own separate set of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, referred to as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm’s</a> component hit point pool. An amalgamite swarm at full health has 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> in its component pool (which cannot be reduced below 0), and whenever the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> takes damage from weapons or effects that do not affect an area, its component pool gains the same amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> as those lost by the swarm, and at the start of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm’s</a> turn each round thereafter it transfers an amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> equal to half the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> for a typical amalgamite <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a>) from its component hit point pool to its normal pool of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, similar to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a>, until all hit points in its component pool have been transferred. Area effects apply their damage to both the swarm’s hit points and to any hit points in its component hit point pool simultaneously. The swarm is destroyed only if its hit points and component pool are both reduced to 0.</p>
<h4><span id="Scuttling_Swarm_Ex">Scuttling Swarm (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An amalgamite swarm can use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/step-up-combat">Step Up</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/following-step-combat">Following Step</a> feats to move and reshape itself when a creature takes a 5-foot step while within the swarm’s area. Each 5-foot square of the swarm’s area can move up to 10 feet, though all squares of the swarm’s area must remain contiguous and the swarm cannot move into spaces occupied by creatures other than the one that provoked its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/step-up-combat">Step Up</a> feat, unless the creature it is following also occupies that space. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Movement">Movement</a> taken by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> when using these feats does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>
<p>Amalgamites use their acidic spittle to break down small qualities of common minerals for energy to sustain themselves.</p>
<p>They can also rapidly self repair damaged or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken">broken</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a>, but this requires considerably more energy. The process of creating amalgamites is complex and a closely guarded secret, but amalgamites can replicate by themselves.</p>
<p>This requires qualities of refined metal imbued with significant amounts of magical energy. Due to the potential danger of amalgamites reproducing out of control and destroying their owner’s valuables, amalgamites routinely have strict safeguards integrated into them that limit the total amount of units in a swarm.</p>

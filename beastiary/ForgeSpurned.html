<h1>Forge Spurned</h1>
<p class="description">The choking order of smelted steel tinged with burnt hair and flesh wafts on a foul wind. The jangling of heavy chains echoes ominously. A hulking dwarf wrapped in heavy steel links approaches. Its face, hands, and body are riddled with glowing hot hooks and half-melted razor wire. Black smoke rises from its smoldering beard, framing its freakishly contorted face in ashy darkness. The tormented thing hefts a black iron hammer and as it charges the chains draping its form spring to life like metal serpents.</p>

<p><b>During Combat</b> The forge spurned unleashed its forge breath on a group of enemies, then uses <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-sunder-combat">Improved Sunder</a> to destroy dangerous weapons with its hammer while targeting foes with its soul chain.

<p><b>Morale</b> Forge spurned are not mindless and they will burn forever if destroyed without the requisite number of souls required to appease their god.

<p>Anyone <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> a forge spurnedâs body takes 1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of piercing damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Forge_Breath_Su">Forge Breath (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A forge spurned may exhale a cloud of stinging soot, ash, and glowing embers as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> in either a 30 ft. cone or a 20 ft. radius spread. It persists for 1d4 rounds. Any living creature in the area is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> by burning cinders and takes 1d6 points of fire damage per round of exposure (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-">DC</a> 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save negates blindness but not damage). Anyone in the thick smoky cloud benefits from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> as well. The forge spurned may not breath again until it fills its flaccid <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> lungs with its bellows (a full round action that provokes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Soul_Chain_Su">Soul Chain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A forge spurnedâs chain wraps around itâs burning body, granting it a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor bonus</a> per 10 soul links in the chain. The chain also attacks once per round independently of its forge spurned master (using its masterâs melee attack bonus). The soul chain is treated as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming" style="font-style: italic">flaming</a> spiked chain with an enhancement bonus equal to +1 per 10 soul links (the forge spurned may command the chain to not deal fire damage, thus allowing the soul chain to drag captives to its forge alive. This forge spurnedâs chain has 30 links.</p>
<p>Any slain victim may be soul bound into the chain (as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/soul-bind">soul bind</a>), but this necessitates a day of work at a forge and requires a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-">DC</a> 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> (blacksmithing) check. If the check fails, the dead soul escapes. If the victim is alive during the binding process, the check <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-">DC</a> is only 15, and may be reattempted the following day if it fails. Anyone may claim a felled forge spurnedâs chain, and it will serve its new master willingly, although the wielder must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-">DC</a> 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save each sundown or be transformed into a forge spurned, damned to continue collecting souls.</p>
<h4><span id="Eternal_Damnation_Su">Eternal Damnation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As long as its chain remains, a forge spurned cannot be truly destroyed. A slain forge spurned rises again at full <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> on the next sundown unless its chain is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken">broken</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 8, hp 25, break <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-">DC</a> 20). If a forge spurnedâs chain is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder">sundered</a>, it is instantly slain, never to rise again. When a forge spurnedâs chain is destroyed, the souls bound within are released.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground, dwarven ruins<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Forge spurned often haunt their former homes, skulking in darkened dwarven halls or among the ruins of their peopleâs past glory. They prefer to remain below the earth where their malevolent soul forging goes unnoticed by others. Forge spurned often lair near magma vents, lakes of lava, or other hot environs that facilitate their sinister toil.</p>

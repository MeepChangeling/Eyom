<p>Fire lizards are often called “false dragons”. Despite their general resemblance to dragons, sages have as yet found no evidence of these creatures being in any way related to them. Fire lizards do not associate with or keep company with dragons. A fire lizard is averages 30 feet long but can grow to almost twice that size.</p>
<p>Fire lizards prefer to attack opponents with their claws and bite, though if outnumbered they resort to using their breath weapon.</p>

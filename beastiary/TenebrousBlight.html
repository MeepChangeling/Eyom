<h4><span id="Darken_Flames_Ex"><a name="TOC-Darken-Flames-Ex-"></a>Darken Flames (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Any non-magical fire that comes into contact with a tenebrous blight immediately turns into a dark, purplish-black flame that sheds no light. These fires must still consume fuel, and they die out just as normal fires do. These dark flamesâoften called blight firesâare particularly effective in inducing hypnosis, granting their possessor a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> checks made to hypnotize a creature using the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-rules/occult-skill-unlocks">hypnotism occult skill unlock</a> so long as the blight fire is present.</p>
<p>Many inhabitants of the underworld covet blight fires and go to great lengths to acquire them and keep them burning indefinitely.</p>
<h4><span id="Psychic_Trauma_Spores_Su"><a name="TOC-Psychic-Trauma-Spores-Su-"></a>Psychic Trauma Spores (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A tenebrous blight’s spores float around it in a shadowy cloud out to a distance of 30 feet. Any creature entering the spore cloud, as well as any creature beginning its turn in the radius of the spore cloud, must succeed at a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw once per round or suffer the following effects, which grow progressively worse with each failed saving throw: on the first failed save, the creature suffers the effects of the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/paranoia">paranoia</a> spell for as long as it remains within the spore cloud and for 2d4 rounds after leaving; on the second, the creature permanently loses the ability to see in color; on the third, the creature permanently loses the ability to see at a distance greater than 60 feet; on the fourth, the creature becomes permanently <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blind</a>. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blind</a> creature suffering from <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/paranoia">paranoia</a> that fails its save against the spores instead takes 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> per failed save. Any effect that cures blindness can also cure any of the sight-altering effects caused by the spores. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Tenebrous_Aura_Ex"><a name="TOC-Tenebrous-Aura-Ex-"></a>Tenebrous Aura (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The light level around a tenebrous blight is always two steps lower than normal (to a minimum of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> darkness like that created by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/deeper-darkness">deeper darkness</a>). This is not a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a> effect, and it applies after determining the interactions of all <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/light">light</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a> effects.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or grove (2â4)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Tenebrous blights threaten the deepest caverns of the underworld and places where the veil between the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Shadow-Plane">Plane of Shadow</a> is thin. Tenebrous blights instinctively attack any creatures that disturb them, weakening intruders with the harrowing effects of their spores and lashing out with their shadowy tendrils.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/xulgath">Xulgaths</a> are the only known creatures that can safely disturb a tenebrous blight’s sporesâa side-effect of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Reptilian">reptilian</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>‘ psychogenic secretions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/xulgath">Xulgaths</a> often use tenebrous blights as guardians and obstacles to impede trespassers in their territory.</p>
<p>Tenebrous blights are 25 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds.</p>

<p class="description">This creature looks like a larger, more aggressive version of a normal rat. Its fur is coarse and brown, its eyes green, and its tail is hairless. </p>

<p>Vapor dire rats attack with their bite. A pack uses ambush tactics against potential prey, and when attacking, they often attempt to flank their foe, sending several rats against the creature’s flank while the rest hit from the front or sides. Injured vapor dire rats drop back where they can use their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a> ability (if they are near a source of water, fog, steam, or mist) while the holes in their ranks are filled by other vapor dire rats. Vapor dire rats usually assume vapor form and attempt to escape if they lose more than half their numbers.</p>

<p>Vapor dire rats resemble normal dire rats in all respects. Though more intelligent than dire rats, they seem to possess a lot of the same traits and conduct themselves in much the same way as normal dire rats.</p>
<p>They seldom keep company with their normal counterparts and often times quarrel and fight with dire rats. Vapor dire rats are found just about anywhere save the coldest of climates. Common encounters occur underground or in ruined castles, keeps, temples, and so forth. Regardless of where these creatures construct their nest, a source of water is always found nearby.</p>

<h1>Raggoth</h1>
<p class="description">A sleek black-furred creature leaps from the underbrush, its gaping mouth showing a full allotment of sharpened fangs. Its head is wolf-like and it has six muscular legs. Its body is long and ends in a thick furred tail. </p>

<p>Raggoths are aggressive predators with voracious appetites and a killing instinct that makes them quite deadly in battle. Though its hunting area typically covers only about a mile around its lair, raggoths are known to track their prey up to 10 or more miles. Whether this only occurs when food is scarce or if the raggoth simply hunts and tracks its prey for the sheer thrill of the hunt is unknown.</p>
<p>Raggoths by their very nature are solitary, though sometimes they will work together to track down an elusive target or work together to bring down a particularly powerful opponent. Typically raggoths working in concert with one another are a mated pair.</p>
<p>Raggoth dwell in thick forests and make their home amidst the foliage or in shallow caves and caverns. If a mated pair is encountered, there is a chance (40%) that 1d4 young are present. Young are born live and are fully dependent on their mother for the first year of their life. Around 12 to 18 months they begin to gain their independence, but do not fully leave the lair until they are around 2 years of age. A young raggoth reaches maturity around 4 years of age.</p>
<p>A raggoth is about 8 feet long and weighs about 450 pounds. Its fur is jet black, its nails and teeth are dull white, and its eyes are dull yellow.</p>

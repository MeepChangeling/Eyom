<p>Seaweed leshys constantly grow small bulbs filled with air.

<p>A seaweed leshy can expel a high-pressure jet of water from its mouth to a range of 30 feet. It must make a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> to strike a targetâif it hits, the blast deals 1 point of bludgeoning damage (this damage is not modified by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>). In addition, the creature hit must make a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> by the water for 1 round.

<p><b>Environment</b> <br/> <b>Organization</b> <br/> <b>Treasure</b> </p>
<p>Seaweed leshys usually dwell along coastlines, happily splashing and playing in tide pools, but they are equally at home at sea, floating among large kelp beds. Although perfectly capable of existing out of water indefinitely, seaweed leshys prefer to limit their time away from the sea almost out of a sense of pride. Most seaweed leshys take a dim view of freshwater <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> life, to the point of mocking such plants in the same way an urbanite might talk down to folk who live in more rural areas. Rumors of freshwater leshys are a sure way to bring peals of mocking laughter from a seaweed leshy.</p>
<p>Seaweed leshys resemble miniature, waterlogged green <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a> grown from leafy green seaweed, with skinny arms and legs, webbed hands and feet, and long strands of brown, green, or red seaweed for hair. They wear armor made from a pair oflarge clam shells or from several smaller shells tied together. This armor functions as a suit of masterwork padded armor for a seaweed leshy, but not for any other creature.</p>
<p>Patient and thoughtful by inclination (save for matters associated with those silly freshwater leshys), seaweed leshys believe that in time nature brings what is needed by the ebb and flow of the tide or the steady flow of the river. They counsel against hasty decisions and rash actions, always preferring to wait and see what another day might bring.</p>
<h3><span id="Growing_a_Seaweed_Leshy">Growing a Seaweed Leshy</span></h3>
<p>Seaweed leshys must be grown in seawater. The leshy’s maker plants a strand of kelp or other seaweed in the water and treats it daily with bone ash to encourage algal growth. When first created, a seaweed leshy has no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, but can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> it from available materials given a day and left to its own devices (no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> check required).</p>

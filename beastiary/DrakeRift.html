<p>Creatures of the badlands and regions scarred by the gods, rift drakes are as savage and brutal as the lands they hunt. Their strength and savagery often make them seem like mere deadly beasts, but rift drakes simply delight in battle more than most drakes, frequently clashing even with other members of their own kind. They rarely deign to talk with other creatures, often doing so only as a cruel game in which they make more and more outrageous demands until their victims realize the drakes are toying with them or the manipulative drakes grow bored.</p>
<p>A rift drake is around 14 feet long, end to end. Its burly, spiky body weighs about 2,500 pounds.</p>

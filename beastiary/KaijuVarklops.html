<h4><span id="Breath_Weapon_Su">Breath Weapon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Each of Varklopsâs three heads can exhale a blast of searing fire and billowing ash in a 1,200-foot line once every 4 rounds. Each headâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju can exhale one line of fire as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, two lines as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, or three lines as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>.</p>
<p>Each <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> deals 20d6 points of fire damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area of effect as they are barraged with semisolid chunks of superheated rock and magma expelled in the torrent of fire; targets are also <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round by the overwhelming force. With a successful DC 43 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save, a creature takes half damage and negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stun</a> effect. If Varklops exhales more than one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>, he can use them in different directions. If a creature is subjected to more than one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> in a round in this manner, it takes damage from and must attempt separate saves against each <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>. The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Deflect_Cold_Ex">Deflect Cold (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Although Varklops is vulnerable to cold damage, he can shield himself from a cold attack by reflexively curling his wings around himself as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a> when he would otherwise take cold damage. He must choose to use this ability before any cold damage from the attack is applied and before he attempts any applicable saving throws to resist the cold damage, but he can wait until after the attack hits to choose to deflect cold. When he uses this ability, all cold damage from that particular attack is ignored. At Varklopsâs discretion, he can deflect the cold damage to any single adjacent creature, which is then instead treated as the target of the cold attack. If the cold attack was an area effect that also affected the adjacent creature, that creature does not take the cold damage twice, but does need to attempt two saving throws (if applicable) against the effect, taking the worse of the two results as the actual result.</p>
<h4><span id="Devastating_Ex">Devastating (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Varklops is particularly devastating, and any attack or special ability he uses to deal damage to an object ignores <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> less than 20. Objects take full damage from his fire-based attacks.</p>
<h4><span id="Distracted_When_Outnumbered_Ex">Distracted When Outnumbered (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>While Varklops is furiously focused on slaying kaiju, his rudimentary intellect supports a surprisingly powerful and inflated sense of selfworth that crumbles when he faces overwhelming odds. In any combat round that involves two allied kaiju focusing their efforts against him, Varklops loses his kaijuslayer ability and becomes so distracted by which target to focus on that he must succeed at a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for that round. Non-kaiju cannot distract Varklops in this manner, even if the non-kaiju is similar in size to a kaiju.</p>
<h4><span id="Eruption_Su">Eruption (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Up to three times per day (but no more than once every 4 rounds) as Varklops emerges onto the surface of terrain after <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing, he does so with an explosion of ash and magma. All creatures within 150 feet of Varklops when he bursts out of the ground in this manner take 20d6 points of fire damage. Huge or smaller creatures in this area are knocked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>. With a successful DC 43 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save, creatures take half the damage and negate being knocked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>, but a creature that takes any damage from this eruption is subjected to Varklopsâs burn ability. In addition, the eruption creates a cloud of ash in the area of effect; this cloud of ash lingers in the area for 1 minute, obscuring vision as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/o/obscuring-mist">obscuring mist</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Fire_Monsoon_Su">Fire Monsoon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as Varklops moves at full speed while flying, he can rain down a torrential storm of fire, burning any target up to 300 feet below him. All targets Varklops passes over in flight take 20d6 points of fire damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 43 half); any creature that takes any damage from this attack is subjected to Varklopsâs burn ability. The area affected by the fire monsoon continues to burn for 1 minuteâany creature that begins its turn in this area takes 4d6 points of fire damage. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Improved_Hurl_Foe_Ex">Improved Hurl Foe (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When Varklops hits a creature with his tail slap and uses his hurl foe kaiju ability, the distance the foe is knocked back doubles.</p>
<h4><span id="Kaijuslayer_Su">Kaijuslayer (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Varklops takes particular delight in the slaying of other kaiju, and his aggression causes all kaiju to take a â4 penalty on saving throws against Varklopsâs special attacks. Another kaiju cannot use recovery to prevent itself from being killed by one of Varklopsâs attacks.</p>
<p>This ability does not function against the kaiju known as King Mogaru.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm mountains<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary (unique)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Lord Varklops is indisputably the most powerful of the known kaiju, a tremendously destructive force of devastation that dwells in the heart of an active volcano in a tropical mountain range when not hunting his favorite preyâother kaiju. Although the fact that Lord Varklops so eagerly hunts and slays kaiju might seem to make him an ally of all civilizations <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares">threatened</a> by such creatures, in truth Varklops is also one of the few kaiju to be actively evil in his predations upon the world. When no other kaiju present themselves as victims and the urge to destroy seizes Varklops, the so-called Thrice-Headed Fiend thinks nothing of razing entire cities for his pleasure.</p>
<p>This eagerness to destroy appeals to apocalypse-minded cultists and to deranged exiles who seek revenge against the cities they were forced to flee. Varklops is known to look favorably upon those who approach him with requests for targeted devastationâparticularly if the offer includes the opportunity to attack another kaiju. Varklops has little interest in assaulting civilizations in polar regions, but his greatest weakness is his inflated, if rudimentary, ego.</p>
<p>When facing multiple kaiju, Varklops often gets distracted and frustratedâa condition that several societies have risked using to their advantage by luring other kaiju to their defense. of course, the devastation a city might suffer when three or more kaiju fight may well exceed that wrought by Varklops alone, so such desperate actions are not taken lightly.</p>
<p>Varklops has a particularly strong hatred of King Mogaru, as this kaiju alone can resist Varklopsâs rage. The reasons for this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> are unknown, but certainly Mogaru matches Varklopsâs hatred, and battles between the two kaiju are the stuff of legend.</p>
<p>Varklops is 200 feet long and weighs 16,000 tons.</p>

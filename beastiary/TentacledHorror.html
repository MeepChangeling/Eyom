<p>Ancient and evil, a tentacled horror is a monstrosity from the unknown depths of the earth. This monster is most often found inhabiting dungeons or ruins far from the reaches of civilization.</p>
<p>Tentacled horrors are egotistical and lazy creatures, and put themselves above all others they encounter. Often, a tentacled horror that finds its way into a subterranean society will attempt to set itself up as a god. Lesser creatures such as goblins often accept this false god and bring it sacrifices of living victims. Once ensconced as ruler-deity, a tentacled horror is content to remain in one place to be cared for by its subjects. A tentacled horror that has been in power for some time will be surrounded by a pool of its own slime and the scattered bones of its victims.</p>
<p>Exuding a foul oily slime wherever it goes, a tentacled horror has a powerful humanoid torso that ends in a thick slug-like foot. Sprouting from the torso are four whip-like tentacles tipped in cruel barbs. Most horrifying of all, however, is the face. A tentacled horror has a shapeless head with a single, huge, unblinking eye. The mouth of a tentacled horror is a yawning chasm of sharp teeth eager to sink into living flesh. Above the eye is a glistening black 2-foot long horn – the very source of the tentacled horror’s power.</p>
<p>A tentacled horror attacks first with its tentacles, ripping and tearing at its opponent with the sharp barbs at the tip. Any grappled opponent is immediately bitten.</p>

<p>A begedhi mother plant benefits from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-All-Around-Vision-Ex-">all-around vision</a> when it has at least two living seedlings or parasites within sight.</p>
<h4><span id="Entangling_Vines_Su">Entangling Vines (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A riot of vines grows around a begedhi mother plant, creating an effect similar to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/entangle">entangle</a> in a 10-foot radius around the plant. The mother plant is unaffected by this manifestation.</p>
<h4><span id="Implant_Parasite_Ex">Implant Parasite (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, a begedhi mother plant can force a begedhi parasite down an adjacent creature’s throat, if the creature is currently <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> by the plant.</p>

<p>A begedhi mother plant’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> can only be overcome by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/mythic#TOC-Mythic">mythic</a> sources of fire damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Spores_Ex">Spores (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a begedhi mother plant can release spores in a 30-foot-radius burst. Creatures within the burst must succeed at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. If a creature fails, it must take a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a> to approach the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> on its turn.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect, and the save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> forces any creature that fails this save to double move towards the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> on its turn, and the creature is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> until the beginning of its next turn.</p>

<p>Transplanted from a riotous jungle planet where all flora is inimical to fleshy life, begedhi have appeared on a variety of worlds. The Hegemony believed they could control the parasitic creatures and use them to infiltrate enemy forces, but the begedhi proved unpredictable and attacked anything within reach. Rather than destroy the plants, the Hegemony dumped them on worlds allied with their enemies with the expectation they would eventually arrive as saviors to exterminate the pests and convert such worlds to their side of the conflict.</p>
<p>Begedhi have two growth stages: a seedling and a mother plant.</p>
<p>Seedlings are deceptively delicate plants, evolved that way to evoke a sense of protectiveness in other creatures. Their spores enforce this desire, which serves them well when multiple creatures work to remove them. Seedlings rarely defend themselves to give the illusion of helplessness so those left unmolested may eventually mature into a mother plant and further propagate.</p>
<p>This process takes five years, during which seedlings feed on rotten organic material or small creatures they overcome. As the years pass, seedling tendrils lengthen and become tentacles, and their cheerfully colored berries transform into sickly green lumps which gestate with more parasites.</p>
<p>Once seedlings become mother plants, complete with fully grown parasites, their demeanor changes. The spore cloud they release covers a larger area and compels living creatures to move closer to them. The plants’ tentacles then sprout wicked thorns to ensnare prey more effectively and infect them with parasites. These victims then travel to other locations where they slowly rot, perish, and sprout more seedlings.</p>
<p>Begedhi parasites exist as extensions of their mother plant, but still act as autonomous creatures with a tremendous ability to absorb knowledge and memories from their hosts to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/mimic">mimic</a> them.</p>
<p>Since it requires a week for parasites to fully overcome their hosts, mother plants maintain a larder of infected victims in a secluded place and release them when a week has elapsed to spread their progeny. Mother plants cannot regrow parasites, so they die once they have release all their ‘children.’ Parasites can maintain a symbiotic relationship with their hosts for up to five years, allowing them to spread throughout the stars without having to draw undue attention to themselves. The only telltale sign of a begedhi-infected host is a small mote of green in one of its eyes.</p>
<p>Begedhi seedlings are about 1 foot in diameter and grow as tall as 3 feet. Mother plants are 10 feet in diameter and grow to a height of 15 feet.</p>

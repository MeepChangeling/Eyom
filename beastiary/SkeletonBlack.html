<h1>Skeleton, Black</h1>
<p class="description">This creature looks like a skeleton with glistening black bones, seemingly constructed of blackened steel. Small red pinpoints of light burn in its hollowed eye sockets. </p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Superior-Two-Weapon-Fighting-Ex-"></a>Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex)</h4>
<p>A black skeleton usually fights with a short sword in each hand. Because of its magical nature, its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> feat allows it to attack with both weapons at no penalty. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground<br/>
<b>Organization</b> any<br/>
<b>Treasure</b> standard </p>
<p>Much more powerful than standard skeletons, these minions of evil are often employed as guardians or protectors to keep sealed some ancient knowledge best left undiscovered. They are intelligent monsters and are not subject to the mindless commands that can be given to such <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> as skeletons or zombies. They have a clear mind, and sometimes go against the commands and wishes of those they serve, if it benefits the black skeleton in question.</p>
<p>Black skeletons are the remnants of living creatures slain in an area where the ground is soaked through with evil. The bodies of fallen heroes are contaminated and polluted by such evil and within days after their death, the slain creatures rise as black skeletons, leaving their former lives and bodies behind. Black skeletons are intelligent and do maintain some memories of their former lives. </p>
<p>Black skeletons wear any clothes or armor they had in life, and some still carry their gear or weapons (most discard their weapons in favor of two short swords as soon as they can).</p>

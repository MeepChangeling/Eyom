<h4><span id="Blighted_Unity_Su">Blighted Unity (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Blighted fey within 100 feet of one other can communicate through a shared fungal mind. This does not permit blighted fey to see and hear through each otherâs senses, but they can share specific situational information and tactics through <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-">telepathy</a>. If one blighted fey within range is aware of danger, they are all aware of danger and cannot be surprised.</p>
<h4><span id="Daughter_of_the_Blight_Su">Daughter of the Blight (Su)</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">Fey</a> creatures who normally have close ties to a specific <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> gain this specific quality. For example, blighted fey <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryads</a> are no longer dependent upon a specific tree. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryadâs</a> tree dependent special ability is modified (but not replaced) so blighted fey <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryads</a> are required only to remain within 300 yards of any blighted tree. This ability applies only to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryads</a> and other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> who bond with plants in a similar manner.</p>
<h4><span id="Fungal_Rejuvenation_Su">Fungal Rejuvenation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>So long as it remains within 300 yards of any blighted <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> of significant size (such as a tree) and remains standing on moist <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Earth">earth</a>, the blighted fey gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a> 5. The infected tree does not need to be specifically bonded to the blighted fey for this ability to function.</p>
<h4><span id="Parasitic_Bond_Su">Parasitic Bond (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day with a successful thorn throw attack, the blighted fey can transform the thorns into a single <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing, wriggling maggot that infests and infuses the target with a short-term curse from within unless the target succeeds at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. This parasite creates an <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy">unholy</a> link to the target, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/binding">binding</a> it to the blighted fey. This <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/binding">binding</a> persists for 5 rounds, during which half of any hit point damage taken by the blighted fey is dealt to the linked target instead. The type of damage remains consistent with the damage dealt to the blighted fey. Only one parasitic bond can be maintained with one creature at a time. This bond is a curse and a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Tainted_Blood_Ex">Tainted Blood (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A blighted <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">feyâs</a> blood and flesh are rife with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>. Any creature that deals damage with a bite attack against a blighted fey, swallows one whole, or otherwise ingests part of one must succeed at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save (as per Special Attacks above) or take 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Strength damage</a> and 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Dexterity damage</a>. One minute later, the affected creature must succeed at a second save at the same DC or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1 minute and take 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Strength damage</a> and 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Dexterity damage</a>. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Thorn_Throw_Ex">Thorn Throw (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A blighted fey can shoot a fistful of needle-sharp thorns at a single target within 20 feet as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. The thorn attack deals an amount of damage equal to a sting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attack</a>, with damage based on the blighted <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">feyâs</a> size (1d4 for a Medium <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>), except the attack is resolved as a thrown ranged attack instead of a melee attack. Thorn throw is always a primary attack.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, band (3â6), or orgy (7â11)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/dagger">dagger</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/shortbow">shortbow</a> plus 20 arrows, masterwork panpipes, other treasure)</p>
<p>In certain wilderness regions, strange corruptions of nature <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fester">fester</a> and grow where the boundaries between this world and the Abyss grow thin. Dangerous and evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/fungal-creature">fungal creatures</a> rise to power in these blighted reaches, such as sinister fungus queens or legions of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> spore zombies, but when <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> creatures become infused with this corruption and are themselves blighted, the resulting monstrosities are particularly vile.</p>
<p>The typical Abyssal blight manifests as a black and greasy fungal rot that sways tree branches and limbs where no wind propels them, and a mystic network of fell power extends an unnatural awareness between nearby blighted fey. Dryads are often the most insidious of these corrupted <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>; they lure <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> to literally and spiritually dark places to beget more daughters from their dark embraceâ and further spread the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryads</a> connect through a unified but tainted mystic field that transcends their ordinary limitations and permits them to treat all infected trees as their own bonded trees.</p>
<p>Only magic such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle">miracle</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/limited-wish">limited wish</a>, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a> can sever the connection to the Abyss and cure a blighted fey, restoring the creature to its uncorrupted state if it fails to resist the transformation with a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw against the spell in question. of course, once the blight takes hold, a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> creature is corrupted not only in body but in mind as well, and any attempts to cure such a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> creature are bound to be met with violence.</p>

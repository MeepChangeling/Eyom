<h1>Jesulan</h1>
<p class="description">A layer of thick, black bark covers the form of this lanky, humanoid figure. Two long, tail-like appendages flick behind it, adorned with sharp, thick thorns.</p>

<h4><span id="Bramble_Grenade_Ex">Bramble Grenade (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> every 1d4 rounds a jesulan can throw a mass similar to an alchemistâs bomb with a range of 30 feet. When the bramble grenade explodes it deals 4d6 piercing and slashing damage to every creature in a 15-ft. radius and entangles them for 2d4 rounds. A successful DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save halves the damage and negates the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/entangle">entangle</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su">Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature slain by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> of spore rot has its body destroyed. A fully mature jesulan rises from the point of the creatureâs death 1d4 rounds later.</p>
<h4><span id="Spores_Su">Spores (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, once per hour, a jesulan can release a cloud of nearly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> spores which latch on to nearby creatures and begin to reform their bodies. All creatures in a 20-ft. radius must succeed at a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or suffer spore rot (see below).</p>
<p>Spore Rot: curse and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>-Dispersal; save <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> DC 19; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a>; cure â Spore rot is both a curse and a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which point the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> can be magically removed. Creatures of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> type are immune to spore rot.

<p>A jesulan’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and cause 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> effect stacks with itself.</p>

<p>Recently reclaimed creations of the Fey Worldâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>, jesulans are tree-like creatures of towering height.</p>
<p>In need of an army that could rapidly grow in numbers to supplement the small number of militant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>, the faerie people conducted magical experiments that resulted in the jesulans. Requiring a controlled environment with which to perfect their infantry race, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> placed their subjects in a small, unnamed plane.</p>
<p>Capricious as always, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> ceased their tinkering after a few centuries and the primal monstrosities were forgotten.</p>
<p>The jesulans are not just the only sentient species, but also the only vegetation in the dusty wasteland plane of Jesula. Its first planar explorers to enter the plane quickly learned why, from a brutal attack that killed dozens and left the returning survivors infected. Within a matter of days, the plant-like creatures rose and began to attack nearby settlements. This garnered the attention of their fey creators.</p>
<p>Realizing that the jesulans had slipped their prison, the fey quickly retrieved them. Immune to the cursed spores, the fey safely act as caretakers of the strange race and carefully control their population. The arboreal hulks now serve as easily tamed muscle for the fey lords.</p>
<p>Commonly a single jesulan is âgiftedâ to a mortal as part of a bargain. The creature serves its new master until it releases its spores, killing the mortal and being reclaimed by the fey.</p>
<p>The average jesulan stands about 8 feet high and weighs 2,000 pounds. Rough black bark covers their entire body. Fissures inside the grain of the bark hide the sharp thorns that can be extended like quills at any time. These thorns often catch in the flesh of the victim and tear free, only to have replacements grow back in moments.</p>

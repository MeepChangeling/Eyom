<h1>Widow Creeper</h1>
<p class="description">This creature resembles a monstrous spider about twice the size of a human constructed of weeds, vines, and leaves. Two writhing tentacles sprout from its spider-like body, each ending in a sharpened point. An hourglass-shaped pattern of leaves and brush can be seen on its back. </p>

<p>A widow creeper sustains itself on a diet of brain fluid and blood. Corpses drained of blood and fluids are left where they fall; the widow creeper does not devour the flesh, bones, or muscle of its prey.</p>
<p>Widow creepers spend much of their time in their nests, venturing forth only to feed, and even then, they rarely venture far from their lair. They prefer to lure potential prey to them by rustling nearby leaves or underbrush.</p>

<h4><span id="Control_Plants_Su"><a name="TOC-Control-Plants-Su-"></a>Control Plants (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A widow creeper can use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/control-plants">control plants</a>, as the spell (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> 17th).</p>
<h4><span id="Entangle_Su"><a name="TOC-Entangle-Su-"></a>Entangle (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, up to a number of times per day equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier (minimum 1), a widow creeper can fire a mass of sticky, clinging vines and weeds to a range of 60 feet at a single target. This requires the widow creeper to succeed on a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> with a +11 bonus to hit.</p>
<p>A creature hit by the vines is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a>. An entangled creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> to make a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> check or a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> check. The check DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Fluid_Drain_Ex"><a name="TOC-Fluid-Drain-Ex-"></a>Fluid Drain (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A widow creeper can suck brain fluids from a living creature by making a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. If it pins the foe, it drains brain fluid, dealing 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> and 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Intelligence damage</a> each round that it maintains the hold.</p>
<h4><span id="Improved_Woodland_Stride_Su"><a name="TOC-Improved-Woodland-Stride-Su-"></a>Improved Woodland Stride (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A widow creeper can move through any sort of undergrowth (natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering other impairment.</p>
<p>This includes thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion.</p>
<h4><span id="Plantsense_Ex"><a name="TOC-Plantsense-Ex-"></a>Plantsense (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A widow creeper can automatically pinpoint the location of anything within 120 feet that is in contact with vegetation.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Widow creepers are spider-like plant creatures that make their lairs deep in tangled forests. They constantly harass woodsmen, foresters, and denizens of the forests from their weed-like webs which they spin high in the tree tops.</p>
<p>A widow creeper is 8 feet tall and looks like a giant black widow formed from leaves, weeds, and tangled brush. It is dark greenish-brown in color. Two long, sinewy vine-like tentacles protrude from its body and aid the creature in capturing and securing its prey.</p>
<p>A widow creeper utters no sounds and cannot speak any known languages.</p>

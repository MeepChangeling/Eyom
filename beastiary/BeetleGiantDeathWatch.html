<p>The death watch beetle makes its lair in forests and uses a mixture of saliva and earth to stick rubbish (leaves and twigs, for instance) to itself in order to attack by surprise.</p>
<p>The death watch beetle begins combat using its death rattle ability. Any creatures that survive are bitten by the beetleâs mandibles and devoured.</p>

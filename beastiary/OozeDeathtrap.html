<p>A deathtrap ooze is a disgusting mass of brown-orange sludge that moves and hunts of its own volition. It exists only to feed. Thought to be related to ochre jellies, the deathtrap ooze is up to 12 feet wide and 6 inches deep in its normal, mobile form. While moving, it shrinks a foot or two in width, gaining about 6 inches of height, and rolls forward in a quivering mass.</p>
<p>Deathtrap oozes are less inclined to look for prey than are other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a>âthey prefer to hunt by ambush. Their ability to assume the form of simple mechanical traps has long intrigued scholars, but this ability is not something born out of intellect as much as by supernatural cunning. A deathtrap <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> lacks any creative abilityâit can only mimic traps that it has encountered during its wanderings, and even then, the repertoire of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps/">trap</a> designs it can draw upon is limited to just the last few it has encountered.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> surely have an origin rooted in magical meddling. Countless ancient crypts have such <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> within, lurking patiently in ageless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps/">trap</a> form, awaiting would-be tomb-raiders for a first-in-centuries breakfast. Those who have studied the deathtrap ooze suppose that <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a> of some lost culture altered ochre jellies into perfect guardians.</p>
<p>Like ochre jellies, elder deathtrap oozes can grow to be enormous. Rumor holds that some can also duplicate even more complex traps that release toxic fumes, spray acid, or contain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. Some even claim there are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> so huge that they can duplicate traps that fill entire rooms with multiple moving parts.</p>

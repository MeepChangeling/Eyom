<h1>Ooze, Mimic</h1>
<p class="description">The body of this humanoid-shaped ooze is composed of an oily, black liquid. Its body ripples as it moves, and tendrils of hair flow around its expressionless face.</p>

<p>A mimic ooze can tread on liquid as if it were firm ground.</p>
<h4><span id="Hypnotic_Flow_Su">Hypnotic Flow (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The body of a mimic ooze can move and flow in a peculiar mixture of familiar and alien motions. A creature within 30 feet of it becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated">fascinated</a> for 1d4 rounds (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 18 negates). Once a creature succeeds at a save against the fascination effect, it remains immune to this ability for 1 hour. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Pool_Ex">Pool (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mimic ooze can release its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> form, emulating a pool of dark liquid. An observer must succeed at a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check to notice the unnatural flow of the pool. If the mimic ooze initiates combat from this state, it gains a +6 bonus on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative">initiative</a> check.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Mimic oozes consist of deep-black liquid that has taken on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> form.</p>
<p>The liquid dissolves organic matter rapidly, which can pose a serious threat to any creatures that come into contact with it.</p>
<p>Not only can these mimic oozes learn the behavior of other creatures, but they can even imitate it as well. If a mimic ooze comes into contact with a creature physically, it envelops and consumes that victim, leaving behind nothing but a clean <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a> and any durable gear that the creature was carrying. As a mimic ooze absorbs a victim, it takes on some echoes of its mannerisms and thoughts as well as the targetâs outward features, which contribute to the oozeâs primitive, chaotic mind. These jumbled shadows of thought fall second to the impulse that mimic oozes have to devour sentient humanoids.</p>
<p>Mimic oozes either stalk creatures they notice nearby, waiting for a chance to close the distance between them, or lie in wait for their prey to come near. Once a mimic ooze has enshrouded a creature, it doesnât release its victim unless forced to do so. Itâs rumored that more advanced mimic oozes have been able to form more coherent minds, though these are still alien in their function and purpose.</p>

<h4><span id="Anathema_Su">Anathema (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A debased fey has been rejected by the purity of nature. Normal plants within 20 feet wither and die if the debased fey remains in proximity for more than 5 minutes. Pure environments such as untouched forests and clear streams and ponds may become spoiled and polluted if the debased fey remains in that environment for more than 1 day.</p>
<p>Plant creatures (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/shambling-mound">shambling mounds</a>, for example) take 1d2 points of damage each round they remain within 20 feet of a debased fey. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save negates the damage for that round. A new save can be made each round.</p>
<h4><span id="Cold_Touch_Su">Cold Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The touch of an asrai is supernaturally cold. All damage dealt from an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/asrai">asraiâs</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> is cold damage. This ability is constant, but the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/asrai">asrai</a> can suppress or resume it at will as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Defiling_Touch_Su">Defiling Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The damage dealt by a debased feyâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> resists all magical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> (though it can be healed normally through rest). A creature attempting to cast a cure spell or a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal">heal</a> spell on a creature damaged by a debased feyâs natural attacks must make a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check (DC 10 + 1/2 the debased feyâs HD + the debased <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">feyâs</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier, +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>), or the spell has no effect on the injured creature.</p>
<h4><span id="Water_Dependent_Su">Water Dependent (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An asrai can survive on land for 1 hour per 2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>. After that, it begins to suffocate. Lost <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> points are immediately restored if the asrai returns to the water. If its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> reaches 0 it dies, collapsing into a puddle of water.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold and temperate aquatic<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or colony (2â12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>This being looks like a oneâfoot tall female elf with delicate features, emerald eyes, long golden hair, and pale blue skin.</p>
<p>Asrai dwell in crystal clear lakes, ponds, and rivers. They can be found in any large body of water far from civilized lands. Most asrai spend their time frolicking and playing in the lake they call home, dancing among the fish and playfully splashing the various woodland creatures that venture near the water for a drink. Asrai are protective of their aquatic homes, however, and attack en masse any foolish human so oafish as to not ask their permission to enter the water.</p>
<p>Asrai spend most of their time in the water, preferring not to touch land if possible. Though they can survive on land for a short amount of time, they prefer not to risk such ventures, so any encounter with an asrai is almost always in the water. Asrai make their homes in giant seashells or natural underwater caves. These homes are usually concealed under a canopy of aquatic plants, algae, and seaweed so potential enemies cannot easily find them.</p>

<p>A charnel god gains, as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, the domain spells of two domains granted by the deity from which it formed. It can use domain spells of 5th level or lower as at-will <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, spells of 6th to 8th level three times per day as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, and 9th level spells once per day as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> for these abilities equals the charnel godâs CR (23 for most charnel gods), and the save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>. The charnel god does not gain any of these domainsâ granted powers. The charnel god presented above has the Death and Chaos domains, and these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> are included in its stat block.</p>
<h4><span id="Favored_Weapon_Su">Favored Weapon (Su)</span></h4>

<p><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/atonement">Atonement</a> can remove this effect, but only if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check.

<p>The gods are no less strange and terrifying in death than in life. Though the death of any god is staggeringly rare, some do meet violent ends, often at the hands of other deities.</p>
<p>When this happens, the deityâs death casts fragments of the godâs power out among the planes. These fragments are sometimes drawn to places where the god was worshiped in its life, where they can produce miraculous effects, such as striking the godâs devout followers <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deaf</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blind</a>, or granting visions of the godâs demise. Sometimes these shards of power go unnoticed and boil away into nothing over time. But sometimes, something far more terrible occursâsuch fragments can find a new home within a graven image of the former deity, forming a new creature: a charnel god.</p>
<p>Regardless of the deceased godâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> or nature, all charnel gods are beings of sublime wickedness fueled by bitter anger. The memory of being killed and cast into the void leaves charnel gods utterly and cruelly insane.</p>
<p>Further, they feel the pain of being incomplete, of being only a small portion of what they once were, and this torments them. Charnel gods have some memories of their time as gods, but any recollections are fragmented and muddled. A charnel god might be able to share a hidden secret it knew in its former life, but it could just as easily confuse the details or call forth a false memory, making it an unreliable source of wisdom. Charnel gods resent such questions anyway, as remembering their former lives only reminds them of their pitiful current state.</p>
<p>To a charnel god, all worshipers are false and deserve to be punished for their lack of loyalty and devotion.</p>
<p>At the same time, charnel gods long for mortalsâ worship. Truly, that is a charnel godâs greatest <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a>âto once again be venerated, offered sacrifices, and loved and feared above all else in the world. Charnel gods cannot grant spells like a true deity, and so must rely on their own terrible powers and fearsome demeanor to cow and bully others into worshiping them. Their cults rarely last long, for the charnel god is an easily angered and fickle deity.</p>
<p>The example charnel god presented here was once a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lord</a> of the hunt who was slain by a vengeful goddess. When creating a charnel god of a different deity, GMs should replace some or all of the charnel godâs feats and skills to better support that deityâs favored weapon and fighting style. Likewise, the charnel godâs melee attacks should be altered as needed, but the end result should approximate the average damage a CR 23 creature might deal in a round. Note that charnel gods like the one detailed above can attack with their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> as secondary attacks when attacking with ranged weapons.</p>
<p>A charnel god stands 15 feet tall and weighs 12 tons.</p>

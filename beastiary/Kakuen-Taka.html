<p>Once per round, when a kakuen-taka kills or reduces a creature to negative <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> attack, it automatically attempts to consume the target’s flesh as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> DC 24 negates). If the target fails its save, its body is destroyed and the kakuen-taka gains the benefits of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/death-knell">death knell</a> spell. This is a death attack.</p>
<h4><span id="Create_Carrionstorm_Ex"><a name="TOC-Create-Carrionstorm-Ex-"></a>Create Carrionstorm (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> at sunrise, a kakuen-taka (a bhoga <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> with a flesh mansion) can create 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/carrionstorm">carrionstorms</a>. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/carrionstorm">carrionstorms</a> have a blinding poison in addition to their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> attack. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/carrionstorm">carrionstorms</a> are not under the control of the kakuen-taka but instinctively follow it, attacking minor foes while the kakuen-taka destroys greater threats. If the flesh mansion is destroyed and the kakuen-taka does not create another one within 24 hours, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/carrionstorm">carrionstorms</a> are destroyed. Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/carrionstorm">carrionstorms</a> in excess of four wander away from the kakuen-taka and are automatically destroyed 24 hours later.</p>

<h4><span id="Flesh_Mansion_Ex"><a name="TOC-Flesh-Mansion-Ex-"></a>Flesh Mansion (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A kakuen-taka’s bhoga <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> normally inhabits a hollowed-out reconfigured corpse called a flesh mansion, which it uses as a shelter, vehicle, and war machine. When the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> wears a flesh mansion, it uses the above stat block (unlike a normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a>, the flesh mansion’s slam attacks have reach and threaten squares within its reach). As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> can abandon its flesh mansion (which falls inert in its square), inhabit an empty flesh mansion, hide within its flesh mansion (gaining <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> against all opponents but still being able to use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> attack), or stop hiding within the flesh mansion. If the flesh mansion is destroyed, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> can create another by performing a ritual that requires 1 hour and the corpse of a Huge creature. The flesh mansion is not a separate creature, nor is it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>; it is merely a corpse the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> manipulates.</p>

<h4><span id="Fleshy_Shield_Ex"><a name="TOC-Fleshy-Shield-Ex-"></a>Fleshy Shield (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A newly created flesh mansion has 150 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> takes only half damage from all attacks that deal hit point damage, with the remainder taken by the flesh mansion. Because a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> of Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage, apply half of all weapon damage to the fleshy shield and ignore the half that would be applied to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a>. When the flesh mansion reaches 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it is destroyed and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> functions like a normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> (see Flesh Mansion above). A kakuen-taka can repair a damaged flesh mansion by spending a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> grafting a corpse into it (restoring 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> for a Small corpse, 10 for Medium, 20 for Large, 50 for Huge).</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, patrol (1 swarm with 1 flesh mansion and 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/carrionstorm">carrionstorms</a>), or gang (1d3 patrols)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>In the far northern lands a strange and terrifying menace plagues the tundra and prairieâshambling fleshy abominations called kakuen-taka, the Hunger That Moves. They wander the desolate emptiness of the subpolar wilds. </p>
<p>As much a plague upon <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> as upon the mortal races, kakuen-taka have no true allies. Perhaps this accounts for their constant wandering and their fondness for desolate and isolated locales, far from any that might interfere with their feasting. Rarely, a powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon">demon</a> might enslave one with magic and use the swarm’s dimensional snare ability to capture and kill its rivals. In lonely moors and hills, kakuen-taka regularly eradicate patrols and entire settlements.</p>
<p>Kakuen-taka are indifferent to their own kind and attack each other only if one swarm has a flesh mansion and the other does not. Given adequate food, several kakuen-taka might travel together to tear apart larger prey, but over time they usually wander apart, following their separate <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/carrionstorm">carrionstorms</a>, and have no sense of loyalty toward their former comrades.</p>

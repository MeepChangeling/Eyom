<p><b>Before Combat</b> Maddened engines of destruction, argorths use their fearful shriek ability and then rampage into battle.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Once engaged, argorths attempt to swallow as many creatures as they can, using their ground slam ability to devastate wide areas.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Argoths know no fear and fight until destroyed.</p>

<h4><span id="Blindsight_Ex"><a name="TOC-Blindsight-Ex-"></a>Blindsight (Ex)</span></h4>
<p> An argorth can ascertain the location of all creatures within 120 feet. Beyond that range it is considered blinded, and must use other senses to locate creatures.</p>
<h4><span id="Death_Throes_Ex"><a name="TOC-Death-Throes-Ex-"></a>Death Throes (Ex)</span></h4>
<p> When an argorth is reduced to -24 hit points or lower, it collapses to the ground and thrashes wildly. It gets one final tail slam attack on every creature within 10 feet, after which it dies. It cannot grapple or constrict with this final attack. </p>
<h4><span id="Fearful_Shriek_Su"><a name="TOC-Fearful-Shriek-Su-"></a>Fearful Shriek (Su)</span></h4>
<p> An argorth can emit a wholly unnatural shriek, a howl not of the mortal world. When an argorth uses this ability, all creatures within 100 feet must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be shaken for as long as the monster remains in sight. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. This ability does not affect creatures with more Hit Dice than the argorth. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same argorth’s fearful shriek for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p>
<h4><span id="Ground_Slam_Ex"><a name="TOC-Ground-Slam-Ex-"></a>Ground Slam (Ex)</span></h4>
<p> As a full-round action, an argorth can lift its entire body into the air and slam it against the ground in a single, reckless attack. This attack deals 1d10 points of damage to the argorth, but all creatures within 5 feet of the monster are targeted by a +13 melee attack which deals 2d8+16 points of damage. Any creature standing within 10 feet of an argorth when it makes this attack (including those who might be damaged) must make a DC 23 Reflex save or be knocked prone by the sheer force of the blow. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p>
<h4><span id="Skills_Ex"><a name="TOC-Skills-Ex-"></a>Skills (Ex)</span></h4>
<p> An argorth can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. </p>

<h1>Frost Worm</h1>
<p class="description">This immense white worm has a single circular eye in the center of its head. Wisps of icy fog waft up from between its mandibles.</p>

<h4><span id="Cold_Su"><a name="TOC-Cold-Su-"></a>Cold (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A frost wormâs body generates intense cold, allowing it to deal an additional 4d6 cold damage with its bite attack. Any creature that attacks a frost worm with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of cold damage per successful hit. A creature that grapples or is grappled by a frost worm takes 4d6 points of cold damage per round the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> is maintained.</p>
<h4><span id="Death_Throes_Su"><a name="TOC-Death-Throes-Su-"></a>Death Throes (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When killed, a frost worm explodes in a 100-foot-radius burst that deals 12d6 cold damage and 8d6 piercing damage (DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> half). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Trill_Su"><a name="TOC-Trill-Su-"></a>Trill (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a frost worm can emit a strange trilling sound that affects all creatures within a 100-foot radius. Creatures must succeed on a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated">fascinated</a> for as long as the worm continues to trill (the frost worm can maintain this trill by concentrating). Once a creature has resisted or broken the effect, it cannot be affected again by that same frost wormâs trill for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<p>With armor-crushing jaws, flesh that radiates cold, and a terrible keening cry capable of holding creatures fascinated, frost worms are apex predators of the frozen tundra and glaciers. In the frost wormsâ far-reaching hunting grounds, they fear only the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/remorhaz">remorhaz</a>, for the heat generated by an enraged remorhaz causes intense pain to a frost worm.</p>
<p>This extreme aversion to heat, as well as its freezing touch and devastating breath weapon, stems from an unusual facet of frost worm physiologyâveins that run with magically cold blood. This creatureâs ichor is clear, but infused with such sub-freezing temperatures that the monsterâs flesh can freeze water in the skin of Creatures that touch it. When a frost worm dies, this magical energy dissipates, and both blood and muscle immediately freeze solid and then explode into a catastrophic barrage of icy shrapnel. As a result, even those predators that might legitimately prey upon the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing monstrosities tend to leave frost worms well enough alone.</p>
<p>An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.</p>

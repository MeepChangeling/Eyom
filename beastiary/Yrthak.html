<h4><span id="Blind_Ex"><a name="TOC-Blind-Ex-"></a>Blind (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A yrthak sees and senses exclusively through its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> ability, which is based on sound and movementâbeyond 120 feet, it is considered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blind</a>. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deaf</a> yrthak is effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> as well except against adjacent foesâits weak eyesight functions enough for it to attack targets this close, although in such cases these creatures still gain the benefit of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> (20% miss chance) because of the creatureâs poor vision. It is invulnerable to all sight-based effects and attacks, including <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> attacks.</p>
<h4><span id="Explosion_Ex"><a name="TOC-Explosion-Ex-"></a>Explosion (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a yrthak can fire its sonic lance at the ground, a large rock, a stone wall, or a similar nonmagical object within 60 feet to create an explosion. This attack deals 2d6 points of piercing damage to all within 10 feet of the effectâs center.</p>
<h4><span id="Sonic_Lance_Ex"><a name="TOC-Sonic-Lance-Ex-"></a>Sonic Lance (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Once per round, a yrthak can focus sonic energy in a 60-foot ray that deals 8d6 sonic damage to one target.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate deserts, hills, or mountains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or clutch (3â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Swift, cunning, and perpetually ravenous, the yrthak terrorizes the barren wastelands in which it makes its home, swooping down from on high to blast prey with bursts of pure sound. Though technically blind, as its eyes are tiny and barely capable of vision beyond a few feet, the yrthak senses its surroundings via acute hearing and echolocation. While its powerful jaws and claws are equally capable of taking down opponents, the yrthak generally prefers to wheel through the sky on its membranous wings, firing bolt after bolt of sound into its prey, and exulting in the thrill of the hunt. </p>
<p>An adult yrthak is 20 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds. Yrthaks spend most of their time aloftâa yrthak hunt often lasts several days, with the yrthak skimming roughly 100 feet over the ground in its wide-ranging search for live prey, only resorting to grazing on carrion in direst need. While they have near-human intelligence, yrthaks generally do not seem interested in forming societies of their ownâalthough the sight of a clutch of yrthaks tormenting a captured morsel might seem to indicate otherwise.</p>

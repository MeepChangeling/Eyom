<h4><span id="Steal_Oxygen_Ex">Steal Oxygen (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a lifesuit symbiont successfully grapples a creature it forces clusters of small tubes into its enemyâs mouth and nose. At the start of the lifesuitâs next turn, if the symbiont maintains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>, it begins draining oxygen from the targetâs lungs. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> creature must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or begin to suffocate. A suffocating creature cannot speak or successfully cast spells with verbal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a>. This effect ends if either the lifesuit or the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> creature breaks the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>. Each round the lifesuit successfully forces a creature to suffocate replenishes 1 round of the suitâs oxygen supply.</p>
<h4><span id="Natural_Armor_Ex">Natural Armor (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When bonded, a lifesuit symbiont grants its host a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Environment_Protection_Ex">Environment Protection (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A lifesuit protects the host from extreme cold as if by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/endure-elements">endure elements</a> as well as pressure changes of space. The natural ichor and fluids of the lifesuit symbiont allow the symbiont to seal any punctures or tears instantly.</p>
<h4><span id="Life_Sealed_Ex">Life Sealed (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>While bonded to a host creature, a lifesuit subsists on the host creatureâs exhaled breath and does not require air from outside sources. In return, a lifesuit generates breathable air for the host creature by converting exhaled breath into fresh oxygen. A lifesuit can perform this task even while underwater or in an airless environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, a lifesuitâs host is rendered immune to inhaled poisons and diseases. A lifesuit can supply oxygen to a host in an airless environment for 24 hours, after which time the lifesuit must recharge in a breathable atmosphere for 1 hour.</p>
<h4><span id="Space_Flight_Ex">Space Flight (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When in the vacuum of space, the lifesuit can release bursts of oxygen from its supply through porous nodes on its body. This effect grants its host a fly speed of 20 ft. with poor maneuverability for 1 minute in exchange for 1 hour of its current air supply.</p>
<h4><span id="Radiation_Resistance_Ex">Radiation Resistance (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A lifesuit completely protects its host against low radiation and reduces the effects of medium radiation to low radiation, but it offers no protection against high or severe radiation.</p>

<p>The lifesuit symbiont uses its roots to attach to the hostâs chest. From a central stem which covers most of the hostâs body, thousands of vines branch out, completely encasing the host. Specialized membranous leaves cover the eyes, allowing the host to see. The vines secrete a fluid which temporarily binds them together, making the suit airtight.</p>
<p>Thousands of tiny sacs pump oxygen through the suit as long as the symbiont is bonded.</p>
<p>Detached, the lifesuit symbiont takes on a humanoid appearance, standing 5 to 5 1/2 feet tall. It features a long petiole with two hinged jaws equipped with special fibers allowing it to suck oxygen from other living creatures and store it. In combat, it can form vague, arm-like appendages from its vines to attack opponents.</p>

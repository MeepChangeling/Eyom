<h4><a name="TOC-Capsize-Ex-"></a>Capsize (Ex)</h4>
<p>An oma can attempt to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Capsize-Ex-">capsize</a> a ship or other vehicle by ramming it as a charge attack and attempting a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession">Profession</a> (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the oma, the oma takes a cumulative â10 penalty on this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Carrier-Ex-"></a>Carrier (Ex)</h4>
<p>A creature swallowed whole by an oma can forgo attempts to cut itself out and instead attempt a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save on its turn. Success allows the creature to move into the creature’s larger second stomach, where it can ride safely for an indefinite period without taking damage. When a passenger wishes to leave, it can cut its way free using the normal rules, or attempt an additional DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save to be safely excreted in a square adjacent to the oma. An oma’s carrier stomach can hold up to one Gargantuan creature (or twice as many creatures of the next smallest size: two Huge creatures, four Large, and so on). At its option, an oma can choose to forgo the normal bite damage of swallowing whole, but not the acid damage of the first stomach.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Starflight-Ex-"></a>Starflight (Ex)</h4>
<p>An oma can survive in the void of outer space, and soars through vacuum at incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip between two planets within a solar system should take 3d20 days, while one to another system should take 3d20 weeks (or more, at the GM’s discretion), provided the oma knows the way to its destination.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> vacuum and gas giants<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or pod (3â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental </p>
<p>The titanic oma, sometimes referred to as âspace whales,â are some of the largest creatures spawned by the gas giant worlds. Capable of soaring through both dense gas and the vast gulfs between planets by means of magically projected electromagnetic fields, these docile beasts skim planetary atmospheres or trawl the rings of dust and ice surrounding some worlds, singing their crooning telepathic songs across great distances.</p>
<p>Despite their size, oma are capable of feeding on even the smallest of prey, straining out life-sustaining molecules such as hydrogen with the electromagnetic fields in their energy baleen. When larger creatures or objects get in their way, however, oma are perfectly happy to swallow them as well. Anything ingested by the creatures in this fashion is blasted by electrical energy, dissolved by acid, and then sequestered in a surprisingly habitable second stomach before being eventually excreted.</p>
<p>A typical oma is 150 feet long and weighs 250 tons.</p>

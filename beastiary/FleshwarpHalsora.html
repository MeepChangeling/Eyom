<h4><span id="Acidic_Tears_Ex"><a name="TOC-Acidic-Tears-Ex-"></a>Acidic Tears (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A halsora’s sunken eyes have oversized tear ducts that weep a constant stream of black, acidic tears. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> that provokes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>, a halsora can jerk its head and flick the acidic tears on a single creature within 20 feet. That creature takes 2d6 acid damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 18 half). A creature that fails its save takes an additional 1d4 points of acid damage at the end of the halsora’s turn for 1d4 rounds or until the acid is scraped off, which requires a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> on the part of the creature taking the damage or a creature adjacent to that creature. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Spores_Ex"><a name="TOC-Spores-Ex-"></a>Spores (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A halsora’s claws are covered in mutated <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/russet-mold-cr-6">russet mold</a> spores. A creature hit by a claw attack must succeed at a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> per round. It can attempt a new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save each round to halt the growth. A creature reduced to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> by these spores explodes in a mess of viscera and spores. Creatures within the burst must succeed at a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw or be affected as if they were hit by the halsora’s claw attack. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> effect. The save is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>Vegepygmies transformed by the vile fleshwarping process become halsoras, creatures twice cursed. The alchemical torture they undergo seems minor compared to what other fleshwarps sufferâit merely increases the mass and strength of the vegepygmy and deforms its eyes so they secrete acid. The process has a more interesting effect on the residual and previously inert <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/russet-mold-cr-6">russet mold</a> within the body of the host <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/vegepygmy">vegepygmy</a>. Mutating the mold, it creates a deadly spore that courses through the halsora’s insides, is slowly excreted through the fingertips, and clumps on the claws of the creature. Though their sunken eyes and constant stream of acidic tears often make these creatures seem pitiful, they are fierce bundles of rage and self-hatred. The conditioning of the fleshwarpers causes them to attack and infect any enemy of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a> they come in contact with, but what’s left of their consciousness rages against the mutated spores they carry. Worse still, many <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a> use these creatures to hunt down and even infect other tribes of vegepygmies.</p>

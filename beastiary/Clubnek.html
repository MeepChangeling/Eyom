<p>A clubnek is a large flightless bird resembling an ostrich found roaming meadowlands and forests. It is primarily an herbivore subsisting on a diet of plants and flowers, though it is given to flights of unpredictability when it takes the role of hunter and predator.</p>
<p>A clubnek stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds.</p>
<p>Clubneks are generally nonaggressive unless threatened or frightened, though they are known to occasionally have fits of erratic behavior that cause them to become quite aggressive. In such a case, they attack until slain or driven off. If its prey attempts to flee, the clubnek often runs it down and continues combat.</p>
<p>A clubnek attacks by slashing with its claws and stabbing with its hard bony beak. </p>

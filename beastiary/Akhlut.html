<h4><span id="Savage_Bite_Ex"><a name="TOC-Savage-Bite-Ex-"></a>Savage Bite (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An akhlut’s bite threatens a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> on a roll of 18-20.</p>
<h4><span id="Shore_Storming_Ex"><a name="TOC-Shore-Storming-Ex-"></a>Shore Storming (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An akhlut automatically transforms into an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cetacean/dolphin/orca">orca</a> whenever it is fully immersed in water, losing its legs and fur. Likewise, when an akhlut emerges from the water, it automatically transforms into its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul/ghoul-wolf-TOHC">wolf</a>–<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cetacean/dolphin/orca">orca</a> hybrid form. If an akhlut moves from water to land (or vice versa) on the round before initiating combat, it gains a +8 bonus on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative">initiative</a> check. This initial attack resolves as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a>. An akhlut has the same statistics in both forms.</p>
<h4><span id="Snow_Vision_Ex"><a name="TOC-Snow-Vision-Ex-"></a>Snow Vision (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An akhlut can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks while in snowy weather.</p>
<h4><span id="Snow_Walking_Su"><a name="TOC-Snow-Walking-Su-"></a>Snow Walking (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An akhlut can walk on snow or thin sheets of ice as though affected by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/water-walk">water walk</a>. It only leaves a trail on such surfaces when it wants to.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold lakes, plains, or oceans<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Resembling nothing so much as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cetacean/dolphin/orca">killer whale</a> mixed with a wolf, the rarely seen akhlut stalks frigid seas and the frozen lands nearby, shrouded by perpetual blizzards. Legend holds that the first akhlut was born fully-formed in the eye of a polar hurricane, the merciless anger of the elements made flesh. Whether or not the tale is true, the akhlut’s ferocity is certainly as memorable as that of any storm.</p>
<p>While the akhlut appears as a wolf-orca hybrid on land, when it enters the water, its legs and fur vanish and it transforms fully into the form of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cetacean/dolphin/orca">orca</a>. Akhluts are particularly skilled at charging into and out of water, their transformation between shapes occurring in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Each akhlut fiercely defends its hunting grounds from other predators, and especially against other akhluts. While this does reduce the number of dangerous predators in a region, it’s unclear whether replacing lesser predators with something as dangerous as an akhlut is actually preferable. Typically, an akhlut considers its territory to be the boundaries of the storm created by its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/control-weather">control weather</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>, and rarely travels far from this storm’s borders.</p>
<p>An akhlut is 22 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.</p>

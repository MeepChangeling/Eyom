<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a sapphire ooze can transform into wearable armor. This armor can be sized for creatures of the oozeâs size or one size category smaller, and the subject must be willing to wear the ooze as armor. While in its armor form, the ooze cannot take actions other than to use its heroâs infusion ability or to return to its true form as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>. While the shape of the armor created can vary, it always appears to be made of glittering sapphire crystals and provides protection as if it were a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Mithral">mithral</a> breastplate.</p>
<p>While a sapphire ooze is worn, it takes 1d6 points of damage each time its host takes more than 5 points of damage from a single attack; this damage bypasses the sapphire oozeâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> and immunities. If this damage reduces the ooze to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it immediately reverts to its true form and falls to the ground.</p>
<h4><span id="Heros_Infusion_Ex">Heroâs Infusion (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day, a sapphire ooze can touch a creature as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> to grant it a +4 bonus on saves against fear for 1 round; an unwilling creature can attempt a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to resist. A sapphire ooze can use this ability as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> on a creature that is wearing it.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elysium-Chaotic-Good-">Elysium</a>)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or colony (3â12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Sapphire oozes are a form of intelligent ooze <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Native">native</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elysium-Chaotic-Good-">Elysium</a>. Steadfastly courageous and protective, sapphire oozes are proof that even the least of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elysium-Chaotic-Good-">Elysiumâs</a> natives are heroic in their own right. These eager creatures have an intense and innocent curiosity about the world.</p>
<p>This, combined with their unhesitating courage, renders sapphire oozes particularly vulnerable to the hazards of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elysium-Chaotic-Good-">Elysium</a>, as they have no qualms about wandering into any corner of the plane in search of adventure or vulnerable creatures in need of rescue. of course, in most such cases, the sapphire oozes themselves must be rescued, whether by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/azata">azatas</a> or by visiting adventurers; wandering <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/azata">azatas</a> are often alert for the bubbling sound of a sapphire oozeâs distress calls.</p>
<p>Sapphire oozes that find their way to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> usually do so by accident. In such cases, the ooze eagerly seeks out novice adventurers or aspiring heroes to share adventures with, using their abilities to protect their allies and inspire them to greatness. They are often quite surprised and confused when they encounter other oozes, which sapphire oozes never expect to be so mindless and such boring conversationalists.</p>

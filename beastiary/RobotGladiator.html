<p>Three times per day as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>, a gladiator robot can change one of its resistances to any other energy type for 1 minute.</p>
<h4><span id="Boosted_Charge_Ex">Boosted Charge (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Twice per day, a gladiator robot can make a full-attack action at the end of a charge instead of a single attack.</p>
<h4><span id="Dense_Structure_Ex">Dense Structure (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gladiator robot gains bonus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> as if it were a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> two sizes larger.</p>
<h4><span id="Flexible_Programming_Ex">Flexible Programming (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Ten times per day as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>, a gladiator robot can gain the benefit of any feat for which it qualifies but does not have. Each feat remains in effect for 1 minute. In addition, it counts its racial <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighter</a> levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. If it has levels in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighter</a>, these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> stack with these levels.</p>
<h4><span id="Integrated_Weaponry_Ex">Integrated Weaponry (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gladiator robotâs arms have integrated weaponry. These weapons cannot be disarmed, removed, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder">sundered</a>. A gladiator robotâs programming allows it to wield these weapons as if it were proficient in their use.</p>
<h4><span id="Adamantine_Chainsaw_Ex">Adamantine Chainsaw (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Two of a gladiator robotâs arms link into a motor-driven chainsaw with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a> cutters and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Chain">chain</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Adamantine_Buzz_Saw_Ex">Adamantine Buzz Saw (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>One of a gladiator robotâs arms ends in a spinning blade.</p>
<h4><span id="Hypersonic_Rifle_Ex">Hypersonic Rifle (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>One of a gladiator robotâs arms ends in a powerful rifle that fires metal slugs at hypersonic velocities. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 2d12 points of damage. A creature struck must succeed at a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Overclocked_Targeting_Ex">Overclocked Targeting (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Gladiator robots operate beyond the limits of stability and safety. A gladiator robot that suffers a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> does not become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> as is normal for a robot, but it loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe. Upon taking a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>, the gladiator robot must attempt a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. On a success, for the following round it attacks a randomly determined target within 60 feet. On a failed save, it attacks random targets for the following 1d4+1 rounds.</p>
<h4><span id="Programmed_to_Entertain_Ex">Programmed to Entertain (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gladiator robot gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate">Intimidate</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform">Perform</a> (gladiator) as class skills and gains a +2 bonus on performance combat checks.</p>
<h4><span id="Resilient_Ex">Resilient (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Gladiator robots receive a +5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on all saving throws.</p>
<h4><span id="Superior_Optics_Ex">Superior Optics (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Gladiator robots see <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> creatures or objects as if they were visible.</p>
<h4><span id="Work_the_Crowd_Ex">Work the Crowd (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Gladiator robots are programmed to reward themselves for victory and showiness. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> after reducing a foe to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> or otherwise incapacitating it, a gladiator robot can attempt a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform">Perform</a> (gladiator) check. If it succeeds, the gladiator robot recovers 4d10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, up to its maximum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>.</p>
<p>This ability functions only if the incapacitating action is observed by a crowd and must be performed on the same round as felling a foe or the round immediately after.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or squad (3â6)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Adaptable in combat and programmed to entertain, gladiator robots are designed to provide a vicarious experience to sate spectatorsâ primal bloodlust. They fight with a passion that makes many observers forget they are watching a machine instead of a living being. Constructed to move with grace and swagger both in and out of battle, they are agile and incredibly strong for their size.</p>
<p>Gladiator robots stand 6 feet tall but are constructed of dense metals and weigh 450 pounds.</p>
<p>The inherent danger of spectating a gladiatorial contest starring a gladiator robot draws crowds from far and wide, although it necessitates either large, open arenas or protective structures like walls and raised seats to keep the crowd safe. Many cities that normally allow gladiatorial combat have banned competition involving these robots after incidents of audience members being targeted following a lucky hit against the robot.</p>
<p>While most robots behave in a logical and emotionless way, gladiator robots are gregarious, outgoing, and attention-seeking. Their voices are loud, upbeat, and cheerful, and they endlessly narrate their own actions in battle while providing commentary on their opponents and their actions. This attitude and presence stands in sharp contrast to their menacing, heavily-armored chassis and powerful weapons; these disparate elements make for a combination their opponents find unnerving.</p>
<p>Spectators, however, love the bluster and braggadocio of a gladiator robot, often waiting after a match in hopes of meeting it.</p>
<p>They then sell these rags to wealthy nobles for a few gold pieces each.</p>
<p>Since their programming has been pushed to the limits of their capacity, gladiator robots are prone to develop quirks and bugs in their behavior. Despite frequently being sent back to technicians for repair, gladiator robots often develop personality traits that begin to blur the line between machines and living creatures. While most of these quirks tend to emulate personalities that are brash and energetic, some gladiator robots become enamored of death. These robots are likely the source of rumors about out-of-control âkill botsâ that view killing as pleasure.</p>
<p>Stories of gladiator robots leaving the service of their masters and taking up free lives on their own may be nothing more than propaganda, but such tales are appealing enough that several have spread throughout the world. One famous tale is told by knights who watched a âman of metalâ walk directly into hordes of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a>, shouting challenges the entire way. Whether the robot survivedâ or the story is trueâis unclear.</p>
<p>Repair drones are robots programmed to repair machinery and other robots. They are often found in the employ of inventors or machinists, where their skills are put to good use not only for repair but also in optimizing mechanical designs.</p>

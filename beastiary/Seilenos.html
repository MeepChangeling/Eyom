<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> while its impossible verisimilitude is active, a seilenos can inspire strong emotions in all enemies, all allies, or all creatures (seilenos’s choice) within 120 feet that can hear or see it, replicating the effect of a spell of the seilenos’s choice: <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-monster">charm monster</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">confusion</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/crushing-despair">crushing despair</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/good-hope">good hope</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/j/joyful-rapture">joyful rapture</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/reckless-infatuation">reckless infatuation</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/vengeful-outrage">vengeful outrage</a>, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/waves-of-ecstasy">waves of ecstasy</a>. A creature that successfully saves against a seilenos’s dramatic flourish can’t be affected by that seilenos’s dramatic flourish again for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Any save DC is 30, regardless of which effect the seilenos chooses. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Grace_Su"><a name="TOC-Grace-Su-"></a>Grace (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A seilenos gains a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus">deflection bonus</a> to AC equal to his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> bonus (minimum +1).</p>
<h4><span id="Impossible_Verisimilitude_Su"><a name="TOC-Impossible-Verisimilitude-Su-"></a>Impossible Verisimilitude (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a seilenos can begin telling a story so supernaturally vivid that the elements described spring to life, replicating the effect of a spell of the seilenos’s choice: <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/screen">screen</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shades">shades</a> (can also mimic <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally">summon nature’s ally VIII</a>), or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/veil">veil</a>. It must use a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> to continue the performance each round; if it doesn’t, the illusion immediately ends. As part of this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, the seilenos can add, remove, or change one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> effect each round, to a maximum of three simultaneous illusions.</p>
<p>Any save DC is 30, regardless of which effect the seilenos chooses. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Sustaining_Joy_Su"><a name="TOC-Sustaining-Joy-Su-"></a>Sustaining Joy (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As long as it is within 60 feet of one or more other creatures that have a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus">morale bonus</a> or are under a harmless effect with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Emotion">emotion descriptor</a>, the seilenos gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> 15.</p>
<h4><span id="Thyrsus_Su"><a name="TOC-Thyrsus-Su-"></a>Thyrsus (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any weapon a seilenos wields functions as a +5 weapon. Whenever the seilenos strikes a foe with a weapon, he can spend a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> to use a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> of 6th level or lower that can target that foe. Only the creature struck can be affected by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Versatile_Performance_Ex"><a name="TOC-Versatile-Performance-Ex-"></a>Versatile Performance (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A seilenos can use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Versatile-Performance-Ex-">versatile performance</a> as a 20th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>, using the chosen <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform">Perform</a> modifier for checks with the corresponding skills.</p>

<p>Elder kin to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/satyr">satyrs</a>, seilenoi are primeval <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> bound to the basest emotions, including lust, joy, surprise, aggression, and fear. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> wander the world, indulging in any excuse to experience or inspire passionate feelings.</p>
<p>New spectacles of beauty, physical adventure, and psychoactive plants and alcohol draw their attention, and they encourage creatures they encounter to be equally experimental. Seilenoi particularly enjoy luring stodgy, honorable, or self-important beings into grandiose acts of foolishness or indulgence. Although less notorious than <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/satyr">satyrs</a> for sexual exploits, seilenoi possess a rugged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animal</a> magnetism and an appreciation for all sorts of carnal pleasures. They are particularly renowned for their insight and skill as storytellers and playwrights.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/satyr">satyrs</a>, seilenoi prefer to keep to untamed wilds where they revel in the passionate emotions of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> and beasts that live, grow, and play there. Creatures of the forest often flock to seilenoi in small troupes or even traveling courts. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/satyr">Satyrs</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/leanan-sidhe">leanan sidhe</a>, and muses enjoy the artistry of a seilenos’s storytelling.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/centaur">Centaurs</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/maenad">maenads</a> revere seilenoi for inspiring irresistibly passionate, ecstatic rage. The seilenos acts as a mercurial judge, jocular keeper of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> culture and secrets, and sometimes self-centered celebrity to these groups. Seilenoi traveling across the ocean often take on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/ichthyocentaur">ichthyocentaurs</a> as seafaring guides and honor guards. Most seilenoi get separated from their courts eventually, either because their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> followers move on to more sedate leaders or because the seilenos feels stifled and drunkenly wanders off in search of a change of pace.</p>
<p>Seilenoi who do not lead their own <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> courts sometimes serve as jesters, emissaries, unpredictable generals, or companions for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> lords, deities, or other mighty beings. Seilenoi prove surprisingly dangerous on the battlefield, as they dash about scattering scores of enemies with every cutting joke and inspiring monologue. When dealing with more numerous foes, they confound the battlefield with seemingly natural barriers and illusory sheets of roaring flame. Others enjoy deflating the egos of powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> (and, occasionally, mortals) with bitingly insightful satire.</p>
<p>In their wanderings, seilenoi sometimes seek out new kinds of indulgence and distraction among mortals, in which case these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> generally prove themselves amiable, though gruff. Seilenoi can charm almost anyone with raucous affection or witty commentary. Those they can’t talk into joining the revelry, they generally ply with alcohol or psychotropic plants to lower the inhibitions of civilization and enable a freer expression of raw emotion.</p>
<p>Bored seilenoi occasionally take it upon themselves to mentor mortals with exceptional self-awareness and power. Sometimes they do so while disguised with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph">polymorph</a> magic to avoid undue attention.</p>
<p>Seilenoi are passionate creatures, as thrilled by the chance to have a drunken brawl with new opponents as to explore the body of a new lover.</p>
<p>Usually, seilenoi view combat as a sort of hunting or wrestling game, but if they recognize true hostility, they become a terrifying force. A seilenos never faces combat alone; it summons allies to distract foes if necessary and hides an ever-shifting <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mirage-arcana">mirage arcana</a> while rallying allies and keeping foes off balance by manipulating their emotions. Its illusions represent the natural elements with which a seilenos is familiar, from fantastical mazes of writhing vines to confusing clouds of spores. It is particularly amused by exchanging the appearances of enemies and allies. Seilenoi have also been known to transform especially vexing foes into harmless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a> or useful plants.</p>
<p>Seilenoi are about the same size and weight as male <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>, although they tend toward the heavier end of that range.</p>

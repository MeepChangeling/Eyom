<p>Mudbogs are strange, slow-moving, pudding-like creatures that dwell in swamps, fens, and wetlands. Situated comfortably in its hole along well-traveled paths, a mudbog is likely to be mistaken for a patch of muddy water or a wet spot in the road. Creatures attempting to simply walk over or through the âmud puddleâ find themselves stuck fast and, worse yet, being consumed by the hungry ooze.</p>
<p>A mudbog doesn’t really attack its opponents; its method of getting a meal is strictly passive. However, once a meal stumbles into its protoplasmic body, the mudbog is determined not to let it escape. They are brownish in color, resembling nothing more than brackish mud. These monsters use their coloration to their best advantage and use their acidic bodies to dig a hole, usually several feet deep, in which to lie in wait for a meal. The average mudbog is roughly 10 feet across and 3 feet deep.</p>
<p>A mudbog lacks the intelligence to collect treasure. However, the possessions of its victims can always be found in a heap at the bottom of the hole it has chosen as its home. Actually getting to the treasure involves somehow removing the mudbog from its hole.</p>

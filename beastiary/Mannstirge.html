<h1>Mannstirge</h1>
<p class="title">Mannstirge <span class="level">CR 3</span></p>
<p class="description">This strange man-like creature is held aloft by small, leathery red wings and though it wears the tattered remains of clothing, it has lost any semblance of humanityâpincers are where hands should be and a long proboscis extrudes from the front of its face, framed by lanky gray hair.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Mannstirges have been known to track prey for weeks, sometimes even months, waiting to attack enemies at night when they are most vulnerable.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> These creatures are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/cunning" style="font-style: italic">cunning</a> but single-minded, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/seeking" style="font-style: italic">seeking</a> to isolate targets before begining the slaughter. A mannstirge releases a creature after it has dealt 6 or more points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Mannstirges wing off into the night when reduced to 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> or less.</p>

<h4><span id="Claw_Probosces_Ex">Claw Probosces (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a mannstirge hits with one of its claw attacks, proboscis protrude from within its arms and bite into the target. The mannstirge loses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> bonus to AC and has an AC of 14, but gains a +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> to maintain its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> on a foe. A mannstirge that takes half its remaining <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> in damage automatically releases a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> caused this way.</p>
<h4><span id="Double_Drain_Ex">Double Drain (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mannstirge that hits a creature with both claw attacks in the same turn deals double damage with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Blood-Drain-Ex-">blood drain</a> ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Sanguine_Feast_Ex">Sanguine Feast (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Mannstirges gain a +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> for every 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> dealt to creatures through its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Blood-Drain-Ex-">blood drain</a> ability. This enhancement bonuses for 10 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (temperate and warm swamps)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>Few scholars have been brave enough to study mannstirges very closely, and those that do rarely survive. Fell predators of the night, the rumors and legends of their creation are myriadâsome say that mannstirges are transformed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-stirge">stirges</a> so fattened they cannot fly, while others claim that <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/lycanthrope/werewolf">werewolves</a> beset upon by swarms of the lesser creatures are transformed into flying monstrosities. Once a mannstirge finds a suitable territory in which to feed, it continues to attack prey there until killed or driven off from its lair.</p>

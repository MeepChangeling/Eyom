<p>An aranea is an intelligent, shapechanging spider with sorcerous powers. In its natural form, an aranea resembles a humpbacked spider a little bigger than a human, and weighs about 150 pounds. The hump on its back houses the araneaâs brain. All araneas have a single alternate form as wellâthis alternate form is that of a Small or Medium humanoid. Although an aranea can assume a spider-hybrid variant of this form, it cannot use its change shape ability to assume multiple humanoid formsâthis additional shape is locked into one unique appearance.</p>
<p>Skilled spellcasters, araneas try to avoid physical combat and use their webs and spells when they can. Rather than kill their enemies, araneas often subdue opponents and hold them for ransom.</p>
<h3><span id="Alternative_Tactics">Alternative Tactics</span></h3>
<p><b>Web-Slinging</b>: A favored tactic of araneas involves creating a web and then using that web as a swinging rope to fight from. Generally speaking, the aranea is considered to be on higher ground for these attacks (+1 on melee attacks). To use this tactic, an aranea must first throw a web to a nearby fixed point (usually a ceiling or beam, both of which are generally Large, with an AC of 9). Araneas make one of three attacks using their webs in this way.</p>
<p><b>Angry Falling Leaves</b>: In this attack, an aranea uses its web to break its fall as it suddenly drops up to 30 feet downward into combat, treating itself as a falling object that crashes into an opponent from above. This attack requires a melee touch attack, and deals 3d6 points of damage. The aranea itself takes 1d6 points of damage if this attack is successful.</p>
<p><b>Attack of the Lotus Whirlwind</b>: In this attack, an aranea puts itself into a spin as it descends from its web. If the aranea descends 20 feet or more using this attack, its descent counts as a charge.</p>
<p><b>Graceful Descent of the Flying Blade</b>: An aranea can swing up to the webâs length (moving up to the araneaâs speed) and make a single melee attack action without provoking an attack of opportunity, similar to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/spring-attack-combat">Spring Attack</a> Feat. Doing so requires an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check with a DC equal to the opponentâs CMD. The aranea then releases the web and drops to the ground.</p>

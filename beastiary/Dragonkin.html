<p class="description">This sleek, gold-scaled draconic creature looks both regal and intelligent. A leather harness holds a saddle between its wings.</p>

<h4>Rider Bond (Su)</h4>
<p>A dragonkin can form a magical bond with its rider that lasts until death.</p>
<p>Forming this bond requires a special ritual that takes 1 hour.</p>
<p>Once a dragonkin forms this bond, it can’t form another rider bond until its current rider dies. A dragonkin and its bonded rider can communicate with each other as if they both had <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-">telepathy</a> with a range of 100 feet. When a rider is mounted on his dragonkin at the start of combat, both creatures roll <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative">initiative</a> separately and treat the highest result as their single result.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any mountains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, patrol (3â6), or wing (7â14)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (masterwork <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/glaive">glaive</a>, other treasure)</p>
<p>Somewhere between <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon">true dragons</a> and brute drakes lie the dragonkin. Intelligent, even-tempered, and deadly in combat, dragonkin get along well with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>. Unlike many other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragons</a>, dragonkin have enough dexterity in their front limbs to hold and wield weapons, and favor huge glaives and long lances.</p>
<p>The most unusual aspect of dragonkin is their bond with other races. Dragonkin recognize other cultures’ potential, and often adopt <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> riders. After it comes of age, a dragonkin may form an unbreakable partnership with a rider, who acts as a trusted comrade. In battle, a rider and her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a> are inseparable, in such constant telepathic communication that they seem to be one entity. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> riders are responsible for caring and providing for their draconic companions when they are not engaged in battle, though this domestic role is more a social dynamic than outright servitude.</p>
<p>Many dragonkin adopt mannerisms from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> races, even going so far as to wear armor. This, combined with the fact that dragonkin have thrown in their lot with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>, disgusts some <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon">true dragons</a>. A typical dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and weighs roughly 2,000 pounds.</p>

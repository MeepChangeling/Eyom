<p>The elasmotherium is a herding creature and encounters with herds are common. When danger presents itself, the females encircle the young, while the males <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a> the predator, goring with its horn.</p>

<p>The elasmotherium stands as tall and as long as an elephant, averaging almost 15 feet long and weighing around four tons. Its fur is thick, and its underlying body is tough and very resilient. Its single horn is thick, ivory colored, and almost six feet long. Its fur tends to be a bit darker than the common woolly rhinoâs. Like its brethren, its eyesight is poor, thus it too relies on its keen sense of hearing and smell.</p>

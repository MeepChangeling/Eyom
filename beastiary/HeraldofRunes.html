<h4><span id="Divine_Separation_Su"><a name="TOC-Divine-Separation-Su-"></a>Divine Separation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The herald has been separated from the goddess of Runes for thousands of years and does not know where her master is. The loss of her connection to the goddess severely weakens the herald, and she gains 1 negative level per day, up to a maximum of 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a>. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> cannot be suppressed or removed in any way (including <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">restoration</a> spells), except by using her feed ability. If goddess of Runes returns and the herald regains her connection to her master, she permanently loses this weakness and its associated <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Feed_Su"><a name="TOC-Feed-Su-"></a>Feed (Su)</span></h4>
<h4><span id="Intelligence_Drain_Su"><a name="TOC-Intelligence-Drain-Su-"></a>Intelligence Drain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The herald drains 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> each time she hits with her slam attack. (The herald does not heal any damage when she uses her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Intelligence drain</a>.)</p>
<h4><span id="Power_Surge_Su"><a name="TOC-Power-Surge-Su-"></a>Power Surge (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, the herald can increase the DC of her next <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> (if it is cast that round) by +2.</p>
<h4><span id="Spell-Like_Crafting_Su"><a name="TOC-Spell-Like-Crafting-Su-"></a>Spell-Like Crafting (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The herald may use any of her spell-like abilities when crafting magic items as if they were actual spells.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Extraplanar">extraplanar</a>)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or cabal (herald and 1d4 charmed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> of CR 5 to CR 10)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>The herald of runes is a powerful and dutiful agent of magic who has been suffering in her masterâs long absence. She possesses a powerful serpentine lower body, a female humanoid upper body, and three pairs of feathered wings. Her humanoid half is more serpentine than that of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/azata/lillend">lillend</a>; she has tiny scales on her arms and a scaly cobra hood that blends into her hair. She looks haggard, as if afflicted with a chronic wasting disease, and her movements betray an ancient and resigned weariness. Her voice is thin and susurrant, and she tends to hiss when she speaks, especially when angry. She tends to verbalize in ancient tongues even when communicating telepathically. She is a lost being without a purpose, devoted to her goddess but unable to find her.</p>
<p>Records of the heraldâs origin are lost to passing centuries, but she claims she was created in her current form by the goddess, who used parts from several different creatures and then granted her true life. The goddessâs withdrawal has taxed the heraldâs ability to maintain her own life, and eventually she may fragment back into her component pieces (which may or may not be alive after this transformation). Bound to her goddess by magic and an unshakable sense of duty, she resents her master for leaving her behind to wither away, and despises herself for knowing that if her goddess returns, she will crawl back to the goddess like a sheltered, neglected child who has no alternative but to love her creator and jailor.</p>
<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p>The herald’s degenerative condition means that (unlike most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>) she must eat to survive; otherwise, she wastes away into a skeletal, nearly helpless version of herself. She reached that lowest point only once, but was lucky enough to catch suitable prey unawares and work her way back to an exhausted but functional level. Consequently, the herald makes sure to feed at least every few days.</p>
<p>As there are few creatures in the Rune goddessâ service who have the power to conjure her, the herald is mainly left to her own devices, but (unlike heralds of active deities) may choose to respond to a summons from any spellcaster. In exchange for her services, she demands that she be given outsiders she can enslave for later feeding, ancient magic items, or items that bear some lingering piece of her goddessâ power. She is knowledgeable about ancient magic, rune magic, and ancient practices. </p>
<p>The herald has no compunction about killing something that defies her or appears to be withholding information or objects she wants (if she has to, she can compel answers from its corpse using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/limited-wish">limited wish</a> to duplicate <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-dead">speak with dead</a>). She feels her pseudo-mortality at all times and fears death, and is likely to flee any encounter in which she feels outmatched.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-and-Society"></a>Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>She normally keeps a âstableâ of charmed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> near her (using her <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/limited-wish">limited wish</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> to duplicate <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-monster">charm monster</a>) so she can slay and consume one if necessary. Her devotion to law and hatred of chaos means her minions are usually <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/protean">proteans</a>; though she finds their flesh repugnant, she would rather destroy a minion of disorder than a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil">devil</a> or similar lawful evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsider</a>. She is stern but courteous to these minions, who obey and respect her power even beyond the enforced friendliness of the magic that binds them to her.</p>
<p>Because of her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Chaotic">chaotic</a> associates, she has survived many hostile encounters in which opponents attacked her with lawful magic (such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/o/order-s-wrath">order’s wrath</a>)âsuch attacks do not harm her, giving her a few vital seconds to decide whether she wants to retaliate or abandon her minions and flee.</p>
<p>The herald spends her infinite hours wandering the planes in search of her goddess or visiting the prime material plane to bask in places sacred to her missing goddess, trying to detect echoes of her masterâs presence like an old widower smelling his dead wifeâs clothes for a hint of perfume to spark a long-forgotten memory.</p>

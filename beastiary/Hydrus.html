<h4><a name="TOC-Burst-Ex-"></a>Burst (Ex)</h4>
<p> A hydrus that has successfully invaded a creature will attempt to eat its way out, using its bite as a Tiny piercing weapon. It attacks from the inside each round (opponentâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class">Armor Class</a> is equal to 10 + 1/2 the creatureâs natural armor). It eats its way free after dealing 1/10 of the creatureâs total <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. Victims of a hydrus burst take an additional 1d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> each round until they receive a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> check or any amount of magical healing. </p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Invasive-Ex-"></a>Invasive (Ex)</h4>
<p> A hydrus feeds by crawling inside a creatureâs mouth and eating it from the inside. When a hydrus successfully hits an opponent, it may make an invasion combat maneuver as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. It adds its size modifier to combat maneuver checks as a bonus rather than a penalty. Once it crawls in the creatureâs mouth and down its throat, the hydrus gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition. Once inside, the hydrus will try to eat its way out (see Burst). A hydrus can only invade creatures that are at least one size category larger than itself. </p>

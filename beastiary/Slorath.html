<h1>Slorath</h1>
<p class="description">Slithering from the snow emerges a 40-foot long serpent with glossy-white scales and a bluish-white underbelly, its long, slender, icy-blue tongue flickering. Its vertical-slit pupils glow an otherworldly greenish-blue and rows of sharpened teeth line tremendous mouth.</p>

<p>Alternately, a slorath can use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/3rd-party-feats/frog-god-games/monster-feats-3pp-frog-god-games/gaze-to-ray">Gaze to Ray</a> feat to release a ray of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis">paralysis</a> (range of 30 ft.) as a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>. After using its gaze attack in this manner, the slorath cannot use its paralyzing gaze for 1d4 rounds and it is disoriented during this time (-2 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>, saves, skill checks, and ability checks). The save is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<p>The great sloraths are found only in the coldest and most desolate regions, though close enough to civilization to hunt and stage raids against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> settlements when the slorath goes hunting. Highly intelligent and aware, the slorath is a fierce predator that defends its hunting ground with precision tactics and power. Small villages within a slorath’s territory sometimes strike deals with these creatures; offering sacrifices in return for the protection the slorath can offer.</p>
<p>Slorath are generally nocturnal carnivores. They exist on a diet of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/chromatic-white">white dragons</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/bear/polar-bear">polar bears</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/frost-man">frost men</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/barbegazi-ice-gnome">barbegazi</a>. They are particularly fond of white dragon meat and often go out of their way to hunt for such creatures. Frost giants often strike deals with sloraths so it is not uncommon for the two to be encountered together working toward a common goal.</p>
<p>Slorath lairs are either enormous tunnels deep under the ice and snow or abandoned white dragon lairs. Encounters are almost always with a solitary creature. In rare instances young sloraths or eggs might be found in a lair. Young slorath resemble their parent in all respects. Slorath eggs are stark white in color.</p>
<p>A slorath usually begins an encounter by hiding under the snow waiting for prey to wander by, or by lying unmoving on the snow itself where its coloration offers it camouflage against the white background. When prey comes within range, the slorath assaults it with its paralyzing gaze. Helpless creatures are then attacked with its powerful bite. Those that attempt to avoid its gaze witness the slorath project its gaze as a ray of blue energy (using the Gaze to Ray feat).</p>
<p>Continued aggression against a slorath results in it unleashing a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/cone-of-cold">cone of cold</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ice-storm">ice storm</a> on its foes. If faced with particularly powerful foes, it uses its <i>ice storm</i> and <i>glacial storm</i> special abilities. A slorath does not fight to the death and flees if combat goes against it. Note however, if young slorath are present and they are threatened, a slorath fights to the death.</p>

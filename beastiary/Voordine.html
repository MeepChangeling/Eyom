<h1>Voordine</h1>
<p class="description">This graceful purple jellyfish effortlessly propels itself through the void. Its dozens of tentacles trail behind, each one emitting a pulse of electricity.</p>

<p>Voordines are massive, intelligent, space-faring jellyfish. Typically limited to a single solar system, they travel from planet to planet to indulge their curiosity. They find planets where changes occur rapidly the most interesting. Voordines’ main bodies measure 19 feet in diameter, and their tentacles trail behind it for 40 feet.</p>
<p>They weigh 2,500 pounds and live for 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Voordines subsist on solar radiation and can absorb it out to the far reaches of a solar system.</p>
<p>However, voordines seeking to escape their solar systems- usually when the entire system is at war, or the parent star is dying-must absorb quantities of fire to survive a long-term flight.</p>
<p>They find arcane casters or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental/elemental-fire">fire elementals</a> to supply the necessary energy for their travels. Voordines require fire damage equal to 1/10 their total hp per day to sustain themselves for interstellar flight.</p>
<p>They inflict this damage on a creature made of fire, so they align with creatures capable of healing this damage each day.</p>
<p>The peaceful voordines have an affinity for imperiled creatures and often come to the rescue with uses of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/air-bubble">air bubble</a>, giving them the moniker of ‘space angels’ from those they have saved. Negotiating travel with voordines to specific locations in a solar system is difficult and convincing them to leave their solar systems entirely is almost impossible. Those wishing to travel with voordines must convince the creatures of a compelling reason to visit their destinations, especially if voordines plan to travel elsewhere to satisfy their own curiosities. Fortunately, the creatures are patient and entertain stories or discussions for a long time and typically relent after a few hours. Voordines also agree to let travelers accompany them and can fit eight Medium creatures in their mesoglea for the journey. They do not respond well to threats and react aggressively to bullying attempts.</p>
<p>The nigh-immortal voordines rarely produce young, especially with the creatures far flung across the galaxy. In cases where more than one voordine live in a solar system, the hermaphroditic creatures mate once a century and produce one to three offspring who travel with their parents until they reach adulthood at 50 years. Oddly, childbearing voordines often ‘beach’ themselves on planet while they await the birth of their children. These voordines are extremely dangerous as they become protective of their young.</p>

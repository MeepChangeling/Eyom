<h4>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</h4>
<p>A book golem is immune to any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> that allows <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a book golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save).</li>
<li>A magical attack that deals fire damage does double damage to a book golem (as per a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>).</li>
<li>A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> would cause the golem to exceed its full normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it gains any excess as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>. A book golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A book golem is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> with no free will of its own, designed and made for a specific purpose, only able to follow the orders given to it at the time of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Creation">creation</a> (outside of a few simple commands from the person it has been bonded to obey). It has no possessions and no weapons. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/books-paper-writing-supplies#TOC-Book">Book</a> golems cannot speak, although they can emit an unsettling whisper with their pages; they move stiffly, as if not in complete control of their bodies.</p>
<p>Although most book golems are mindless there are persistent rumors of some that gain the collected knowledge printed upon the many pages comprising their body. Certainly most who construct book golems prefer mindless slaves over free-willed creations, and as a result intelligent book golems are a barely explored concept, treated as fanciful stories from old <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a>.</p>
<p>A book golem stands 8 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.</p>
<p>Comprised of various tomes stacked into the shape of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>, the book golem requires no less than four tomes per limb (along with unguents and bindings worth 500 gp).</p>
<p>Any book can be used, although several <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a> have found that crafting tomes of knowledge and learning seems to grant the golem a sense of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/cunning" style="font-style: italic">cunning</a> and personality (and just as many have discredited that as wishful thinking).</p>
<p>Several attempts to create a book golem with access to the spells contained within tomes bound into its body have thus far proved unsuccessful.</p>

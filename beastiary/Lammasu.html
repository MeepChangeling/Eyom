<b>Treasure</b> standard </p> Although most of these winged sentinels prove wise and knowledgeable about those who would seek to do evil in their lands, many races find lammasus arrogant, dismissive, and patronizing, taking umbrage at their superior attitudes and affectations. Such reactions confuse and sometimes insult these highly honorable creatures, who seek only to do good and aid those weaker than themselves. Lammasus who witness members of other races actively combating evil typically prove more sensitive and address such allies as equals. Should good-aligned creatures prove their skill and overcome any differences of attitude they might have with one of these majestic beings, they find a true and noble ally and an invaluable resource for those hoping to defeat evil. 
 <p>Lammasus are quite parental toward those who join their cause, bringing a lifetime of experience to any struggle. This often makes them stern, but those who know lammasus find them to be extremely caring about those they protect. A lammasu eagerly lays down its own life to protect those in peril if such a sacrifice might win the day. Most lammasus are 8 feet in length and weigh approximately 900 pounds.</p>

<h1>Guardian, Gargoyle</h1>
<p class="description">The head of this sinisterly carved statue of a devil slowly scans its surroundings, every motion making the faint sound of stone grinding upon stone.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Freeze-Ex-"></a>Freeze (Ex)</h4>
<p>A gargoyle guardian can hold itself so still that it appears to be a statue. A gargoyle guardian that uses freeze can take 20 on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Snatch-Ex-"></a>Snatch (Ex)</h4>
<p>A gargoyle guardian can start a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> when it hits with both claw attacks, as though it had the grab ability. If it grapples a creature of size Medium or smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic claw damage with a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. A gargoyle guardian can fly while holding a creature that weighs 350 pounds or less. It cannot throw creatures it is carrying, but can drop them as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or wing (2â8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Many races adorn their buildings and structures with carved gargoyles to make them look more fearsome, to ward off evil spirits, or in the hope of making real <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/gargoyle">gargoyles</a> think another tribe is already occupying the area. Many magic-users also create constructs in the shapes and forms of gargoyles, emulating those creaturesâ ability to blend in with stone structures and taking advantage of the pervasiveness of sculpted gargoyles to create stealthy protectors and watchdogs. Many spellcasters construct gargoyle guardians that have special abilities, making them even more capable and vigilant sentinels.</p>
<h3>Variants</h3>
<p><b>Gargoyle Sentry (+0 CR)</b>: These gargoyle guardians are created with eyes of citrine linked to a 1-foot diameter orb of the same stone. The orb always displays what the gargoyle guardian sees, though without the constructâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision">darkvision</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision">low-light vision</a>. If the gargoyle sentry is destroyed, its eyes and the linked orb shatter into worthless dust.</p>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p><b>CL</b> 10th; <b>Price</b> 30,000 gp; 50,000 gp (sentry)</p>
<p>A gargoyle guardianâs body is made from 1,000 pounds of dense stoneâtypically of the colors and designs of the structure or memorial it is meant to guardâand treated with 1,000 gp worth of rare minerals and precious filigree.</p>

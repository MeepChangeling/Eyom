<h1>Grimm</h1>
<p class="description">This monstrous beast stands well over 9 feet tall and has glistening black flesh. Its head is oval with deep sunken black eyes. Its mouth is wide and large and sports double rows of razor-sharp fangs. A purplish-black tongue flicks in and out of its mouth. The monsterâs powerful arms and legs end in filthy wicked claws that sport broken, black fingernails.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Aura-of-Evil-Su-"></a>Aura of Evil (Su)</h4>
<p> A grimm constantly exudes an aura of evil around its form. This aura deals 2d6 points of profane damage to all creatures in any space adjacent to the grimm. Evil creatures do not take this damage. </p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Blur-Su-"></a>Blur (Su)</h4>
<p> As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, a grimm can <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blur">blur</a> its form (as the spell of the same name). This grants it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> (20% miss chance).</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Devour-Su-"></a>Devour (Su)</h4>
<p> If a grimm pins a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> creature, it deals 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Strength drain</a> each round the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pin</a> is maintained. Each time the grimm drains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>, it gains a +1 bonus to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> score. These bonus points are temporary and the grimm loses them at the rate of 1 per hour.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Ethereal-Jaunt-Su-"></a>Ethereal Jaunt (Su)</h4>
<p> A grimm can shift from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane">Ethereal Plane</a> to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> as part of any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a> and shift back again as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. It can remain on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane">Ethereal Plane</a> for 3 rounds before returning to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. The ability otherwise resembles the spell of the same name (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> 20th).</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Fey-Spell-Resistance-Ex-"></a>Fey Spell Resistance (Ex)</h4>
<p> Against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> magic (spells or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like</a> abilities used by any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> creature including elves) a grimmâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Spell-Resistance-Ex-">spell resistance</a> is 28.</p>

<p>A grimm is perhaps one of the most evil of all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>. Conceived and created by members of the Unseelie Court, the monsterâs only purpose seems to be the destruction of life and that which is beautiful. Legends among the fairy folk say powerful members of the Unseelie Court (specific legends say a circle of powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/quickling">quicklings</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerers</a> are the grimmâs creators) created this fell beast to avenge the death of their own who were slain in battle when the Unseelie Court and Seelie Court did battle.</p>
<p>Grimms dwell in the deepest and darkest mountains making their lairs in deep recesses or hard to access caves and caverns, venturing forth only to kill and to eat. Grimms prefer a diet of meat, particularly goodaligned <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> creatures, but they are not particularly picky and will gladly eat anything (or anyone) that crosses their path. Slain prey that is not immediately eaten is stored in the grimmâs lair for later consumption. These creatures are highly territorial and do not associate with other creatures, not even their own kind.</p>
<p>A grimm stands 9 feet tall and weighs in excess of 1,200 pounds. Stout and powerfully built, its body teems with muscle and is always covered in a glossy sheen.</p>
<p>A grimm opens combat slashing with its claws and gnashing with its terrible bite. If it can grab a foe, it does so, pinning it and draining its strength in order to increase its own. If fairing poorly, a grimm employs its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blur">blur</a> special ability. Against overwhelming odds, a grimm shifts to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane">Ethereal Plane</a> to avoid its foes.</p>

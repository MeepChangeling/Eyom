<h1>Star Vampire</h1>
<p class="description">An unnatural tittering issues forth from the fanged maw of this floating mass of talon-tipped tentacles, all as red as freshly spilled blood.</p>

<h4><span id="Blood_Healing_Ex">Blood Healing (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever a star vampire starts its turn within 10 feet of a creature suffering a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> effect (other than itself or another star vampire), it heals 5 points of damage as minuscule tendrils slither out from its body to leech away the dripping blood with disgusting efficiency.</p>
<h4><span id="Flight_Su">Flight (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A star vampireâs ability to fly is supernatural and doesnât function in areas where magic doesnât work. Furthermore, when engorged with blood and thus visible, it takes a â10 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly">Fly</a> checks.</p>
<h4><span id="Loathsome_Embrace_Ex">Loathsome Embrace (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The slithering wet tentacles and suckered tendrils a star vampire uses to feed with and clutch its prey are particularly disgusting to experience. Any creature that is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> by or that grapples a star vampire must attempt a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to avoid being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1 round. A new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save is required each round the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> is maintained, but once a creature succeeds at its saving throw against a star vampireâs loathsome embrace, it becomes immune to the loathsome embrace of all star vampires for 24 hours. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Partial_Invisibility_Su">Partial Invisibility (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A star vampire is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> in its natural state, although the eerie tittering it constantly emits makes locating it easier than normalâtreat a star vampire as if it were in combat or speaking for the purposes of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks against it. When a star vampire feeds on blood (either as a result of a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Blood-Drain-Ex-">blood drain</a> attack or by gaining the benefit of its blood <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a>), it becomes visible, its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseating</a> appearance laid bare by the blood that infuses its entire being. A star vampire that becomes visible in this manner remains visible until it takes 2 consecutive rounds of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage or 10 minutes pass after it last drained blood or gained the benefit of blood healing.</p>
<h4><span id="Scent_Blood_Ex">Scent Blood (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A star vampire has the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-">scent</a> ability against all living creatures that have blood, and it gains a +10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks against creatures currently taking <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Weakness_to_Bleed_Effects_Ex">Weakness to Bleed Effects (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When subjected to a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> effect, a star vampire suffers wracking pain that leaves it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> as long as the bleed effect persists. Consumed blood drains rapidly from a star vampireâs body when it is affected by a bleed effect, and after 2 consecutive rounds of bleed damage, a star vampire that had become visible after drinking blood becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> once again.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any air<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or clot (3â8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Star vampires descend upon worlds to feed upon the blood of the living. Naturally invisible, star vampires expose their offensive shapes when they feed, for the blood they gorge upon infuses their bodies with a glistening crimson hue. Tangled masses of writhing feelers surrounding toothy maws, star vampires can extend three long tentacles tipped with talons to lacerate foes, allowing the aberrations to drink the blood from the air with thousands of tiny feeding tendrils.</p>
<p>A star vampire is approximately 10 feet in diameter, yet weighs a mere 300 pounds.</p>
<p>Star vampires are effectively immortal and can live forever if not slain through violence, accident, or disease. The bulk of these creatures drift through the vastness of the Dark Tapestry, but without the starflight ability (like that of byakhees), thousands or even millions of years can pass before one manages to find a planet where it can descend to feed. Once a star vampire arrives on a planet, it adopts the new world as its personal feeding ground and very rarely, if ever, returns to space.</p>
<p>It is far more common for a star vampire to show up on a world after being conjured from the depths of space via certain rare spells or rituals. Many of these rites are deliberately ambiguous promises of the aid of a powerful spirit from the depths of spaceâdesigned to serve up the unsuspecting occultist as a hungry star vampireâs inaugural meal on the new world. The source of these dangerous rituals is unclear, for it is unlike the alien mind of a star vampire to conceive of such tactics. Likely, these treacherous spells were inflicted upon the world by a misanthropic lunatic eager to bring pain and doom upon those foolish enough to attempt to contact alien beings.</p>
<p>The strange noises issued by a star vampire seem to serve no purpose, although they tend to sound like mocking laughter at times. These creatures can speak if they wish (although few know any language other than Aklo), but their voices are wet and slobbery and do not prevent the tittering sounds they emit from continuingâonly when feeding do these monsters fall relatively silent.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Ancient beyond most worlds, whatever realm first spawned these interstellar predators is long gone, vanished even from the memories of the star vampires themselves, along with any culture or name for themselves they may have once had. Yet, the star vampires do not mourn this loss. They have no need for companionship, no desire to leave a legacy, and no drive to colonize new worlds, for their minds and motivations are as alien as their strange shapes to most planet-bound societies.</p>

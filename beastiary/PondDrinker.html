<p class="description">Skimming along on six legs, this tiny carapaced vermin suddenly lifts from the surface of the water and darts toward you.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Blood-Drain-Ex-"></a>Blood Drain (Ex)</h4>
<p>A pond drinker drains blood at the end of its turn if it is grappling with a foe, inflicting 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> damage. A pond drinker will never drink more blood than 1 point per its Hit Dice per day.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Leaping-Strike-Ex-"></a>Leaping Strike (Ex)</h4>
<p>A pond drinker can make a single leap from the surface of a body of water to attack a creature with its bite. This movement and attack is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> that does not draw an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Water-Walking-Ex-"></a>Water Walking (Ex)</h4>
<p>Pond drinkers can walk on the surface of water as most creatures can walk on land. They can even use the surface of water as solid ground from which to leap.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Ultrasonic-Aura-Ex-"></a>Ultrasonic Aura (Ex)</h4>
<p>Pond drinkers constantly produce an ultrasonic drone that is disruptive to spellcasters and those with spell-like abilities. Any creature attempting to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability within the ultrasonic aura must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a> check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Environment</b> any river/lake<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or colony (2-8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>Pond drinkers are specialized vermin said to have originated in the lands of the fey. They possess no hive mentality but will gather in small groups to hunt for warm bodies. Pond drinkers are found in the lakes and rivers of the deepest, most ancient forests. Here they plague fey creatures and magical beasts alike, feeding on their blood and disrupting their foeâs ability to combat the verminous plague with their innate magic.</p>
<p>Fey will attack pond drinkers on sight, considering the vermin an aberration to the natural order of the world. For all their varied abilities, at their heart, the pond drinkers are vermin who need the blood of other creatures to live. Over the eons, they have transformed into the water walking, leaping, and magic-disrupting creatures that exist today.</p>
<p>Some suggest that the pond drinkers are magical beasts created by the gods to harry the fey and keep their numbers under control but, as the pond drinkers have demonstrated no advanced intelligence, magical, or supernatural abilities, these tales are largely discredited. Pond drinkers are also not selective feeders. They will drink the blood of any living creature they encounter.</p>

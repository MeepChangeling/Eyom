<h1>Fogwarden</h1>
<p class="description">This creature resembles a humanoid formed of fog and mist. The only discernible facial feature is its icy blue eyes.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Animate-Dead-Su-"></a><b>Animate Dead (Su)</b></h4>
<p>The electrical aura of the fogwarden can animate dead creatures within 20 feet. This is otherwise identical to an <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead">animate dead</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> 4th). The animated creatures resemble <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombies</a> (and use their stats) and are under the control of the fogwarden that animated them. They are not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> however, and cannot be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/turn-undead">turned</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/command-undead">rebuked</a>. If the fogwarden is slain or moves more than 20 feet from a zombie, the animated creature collapses dead and cannot be animated again.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Electricity-Discharge-Su-"></a><b>Electricity Discharge (Su)</b></h4>
<p>Electricity constantly plays across a fogwardenâs form. Any metal object (including metal weapons) that contacts a fogwardenâs body takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Magic items receive a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saving throw to reduce the damage by half. Nonmagical items and objects receive no save and automatically take full damage. A creature holding the object or weapon at the time of contact takes 3d6 points of electricity damage as well (DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save for half).</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Gaseous-Form-Ex-"></a><b>Gaseous Form (Ex)</b></h4>
<p>The fogwardenâs natural form is that of fog or mist. This ability is similar to the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form">gaseous form</a> spell (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> 8th), except that a fogwarden does not lose its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> abilities or its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/lightning-bolt">lightning bolt</a> ability, and has a fly speed of 40 feet. It is immune to and cannot perform <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuvers</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Vulnerability-to-Sunlight-Ex-"></a><b>Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)</b></h4>
<p>Fogwardens shun sunlight. A fogwarden exposed to sunlight is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for as long as it remains in the sunlight, and is destroyed utterly after 1 hour of exposure if it cannot escape.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold plains and hills<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or troupe (1-6 zombies [see text])<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The fogwarden is sometimes called the ice apparition, for much like the standard apparition, the fogwarden feeds on the fear of its victims. The fogwarden, however, is not undead. A fogwarden is usually found inhabiting the coldest and most desolate areas of the world. The fog surrounding it flashes with its life force. These flashes are often mistaken for the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/will-o--wisp">will-oâ-wisp</a>.</p>
<p>Fogwardens favor instilling fear and panic in their opponents to actual combat. In melee, the fogwarden attacks by launching a bolt of lightning at its foes. When a fogwarden is destroyed, it evaporates completely, leaving no trace of its existence.</p>

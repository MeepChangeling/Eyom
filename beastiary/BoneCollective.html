<p><b>Before Combat</b> Bone collectives prefer to spy and skulk but if cornered fight without fear or hesitation, seeking to strip the flesh from their foes.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> If a bone collectives hit points fall below 18, their hive mind disappears and the remaining posthumes fall apart, scattering in all directions to find another collective.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Alternate-Form-Ex-"></a>Alternate Form (Ex)</h4>
<p>A bone collective can act as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> (composed of dozens of posthumes), or it can grant a single member (called an exarch) control, acting as a singular creature. Changing between forms is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>. In its non-swarm form, the collective can no longer use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> attacks, but it can use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack">sneak attack</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a>, and spellcasting, if it has caster levels. It can use its skills normally in either form.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Command-Undead-Su-"></a>Command Undead (Su)</h4>
<p>Bone collectives gain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/command-undead">Command Undead</a> as a bonus feat. For this purpose alone, they are considered to be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">clerics</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a> level equals HD) with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-">channel negative energy</a> class feature.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Hive-Mind-Ex-"></a>Hive Mind (Ex)</h4>
<p>All posthumes of a bone collective within 50 miles of their main body constantly communicate. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. No posthume in a group is considered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking">flanked</a> unless all of them are. Any bone collective with at least 1 hp/HD (or 18 hp for a standard collective) forms a hive mind, giving it an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> of 14. (This is an exception to the usual <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> rules.) When a collective goes below this hp threshold, it becomes mindless.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Poison-Ex-"></a>Poison (Ex)</h4>
<p>Bone collectives distill minerals and cave dragon blood with elements of deadmind poison to create a reddish toxin, called wyrmblood venom, which they smear on their fangs. The resulting freakish red mouths on tiny skeletons are somewhat disturbing, and the effect of the toxin is deadly.</p>
<p><b>Injury</b>âbite; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 22; <i>onset</i> 1 round; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Cha</a>; <i>cure</i> 2 saves.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Superior-Disarm-Ex-"></a>Superior Disarm (Ex)</h4>
<p>With their dozens of tiny fingers, bone collectives are exceptionally adept at grabbing or turning aside a weapon and disarming foes. They gain a +2 bonus to any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a> attempt and always wind up with a foe’s weapon in their hands if they succeed.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or hive (2â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Bone collectives’ tiny bones rustle when they move, as quiet as moving sand. Their long finger bones and hooked claws help them climb on their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombie</a> mounts and control them. Bone collectives almost always wear robes or cloaks, the better to pretend to be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>. They understand that most creatures find their natures disturbing.</p>
<p>Bone collectives exist in numbers too small to have a proper society. They tend to latch onto the societies around them, whether <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin">goblin</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghoul</a>. They prey on the living and the dead, using and discarding them when no longer useful and replenishing lost component bones. They follow goals of their own, unrelated to other creatures alive or dead. The only exceptions are their interactions with necromancers, some <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire/vampire">vampires</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">liches</a>, all of whom they may serve and obey.</p>
<p>Bone collectives live in most environments, but they dislike extreme heat, as it makes their bones brittle.</p>

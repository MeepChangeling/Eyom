<h4><span id="Craft_Item">Craft Item</span></h4>
<p>Charon is treated as having access to all Item Creation feats plus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/craft-construct-item-creation">Craft Construct</a> for the purposes of creating magic items or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Curse_of_Ages_Su">Curse of Ages (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The first time in a round that Charon strikes a creature with a weapon or a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, that creature must succeed at a DC 40 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or instantly grow decrepit and feeble, as if the target suddenly became venerable. The targetâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> scores are reduced by 6, but its mental ability scores are not increased. If Charon touches or strikes a venerable target (either a naturally venerable creature or a creature suffering from this effect or a similar magical effect), that creature is subjected to memory loss (see below). <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Curse-Su-">Curse</a> of the ages is an aging and a curse effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Memory_Loss_Su">Memory Loss (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When Charon strikes a creature with a Stygian bolt or touches or strikes a venerable target, he can affect that creature with memory loss. A creature affected by memory loss must succeed at a DC 40 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or gain 2 permanent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> as swaths of memory are wiped away.

If these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> cause the targetâs total number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> to equal or exceed its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>, instead of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a> the target enters a catatonic state that lasts as long as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> from the Stygian bolts continue to cause its total number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> to equal or exceed its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>.

<h4><span id="Reach_of_the_Styx_Su">Reach of the Styx (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per hour as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, Charon can transport himself and any adjacent creaturesâsuch as passengers on his skiffâto any point touched by the River Styx, even if he is not currently on a plane through which it flows, traveling as if via a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plane-shift">plane shift</a> spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Stygian_Bolt_Su">Stygian Bolt (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, Charon can spit four blasts of Stygian water from his mouth. Each of these Stygian bolts can target a different creature. These attacks are treated as ranged attacks with a range increment of 100 feet. On a hit, a Stygian bolt deals 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage and inflicts memory loss.</p>
<h4><span id="Stygian_Bond_Ex">Stygian Bond (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Charonâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> cannot be overcome by any means when he is in physical contact with the River Styx or when he is aboard his skiff while on the River Styx.</p>
<h4><span id="Transform_Mount_Su">Transform Mount (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, Charon can cause his mount, the Pale Horse, to transform into a skiff that can carry up to four passengers plus himself. He can also transform this skiff back into the Pale Horse as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, in which case he automatically mounts the Pale Horse and any passengers or cargo in the skiff are dumped into adjacent squares.</p>

<p>Charon, the Horseman of Death and Boatman of the Styx, is ancient even by comparison to his kindred Horsemen.</p>
<p>Of all the Four, he alone was an original Horseman, the firstâand onlyâLord of Death. Yet Charonâs title obfuscates his true focus: not simply death as a whole, which is the purview of all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a>, but specifically death by old age. Even the most virile mortals must eventually succumb to that looming specter, and in this sense, itâs unsurprising that the Boatman remains the most powerful of the Four. Like mortalityâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/inevitable">inevitable</a> end, Charonâs patience is legendary.</p>
<p>Charon resembles his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/thanadaemon">thanadaemons</a>, and most presume that he modeled them after himself. Charon, however, is so ancient as to have preceded the creation of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> life and thus his current form is likely nothing more than a modern guise, with his original form long discarded.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">Daemons</a> in Charonâs service range far and wide across <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>, often riding the Styx to other reaches of the cosmos, hunting souls in his name. Unlike those of the other Horsemen, Charonâs servitors often act in understated and subtle ways, yet they harvest just as many souls as others. When approached independently by a traveler, Charon sometimes simply carries the guest off to be consumed. Other times, however, he makes legitimate deals, though his bargains work toward ends hundreds or thousands of years in the making. Charonâs dealings also serve him well in other ways, with even his fellows among the Four often quietly acquiescing to his authority.</p>
<p>Charonâs domain is the largest of the Four, particularly when one takes into account the fact that the River Styx stretches into or borders the othersâ realms, the unclaimed wastes, and the planes beyond. Every branch of the Styx ultimately flows back to Charonâs citadel, the Drowning Court, which comprises hundreds of mobile islands, ships, and floating castles swirling around a massive central whirlpool.</p>
<h3><span id="Charons_Cult">Charonâs Cult</span></h3>
<p>Charon is worshiped by ferrymen and -women, grave robbers, undertakers, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, and so very many doomed and damned would-be immortals. The Horseman of Death is served by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/thanadaemon">thanadaemons</a>, his deacon servitor race, along with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/fiendish">fiendish</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/kraken">krakens</a>, grim reapers, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag">hags</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/hydrodaemon">hydrodaemons</a>, river monsters, and numerous varieties of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>.

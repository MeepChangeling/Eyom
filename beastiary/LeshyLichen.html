<p>The lichen <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-leshy">leshyâs</a> attacks envelop the target in a lattice of delicate digestive growths. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a creature can tear away any such growths. If a creature ends its turn without having removed the growths, the tendrils fall away as they release <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Acid">acid</a> that deals 2d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Acid">acid</a> damage, and the victim must succeed at a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Expert_Climber_Ex">Expert Climber (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A lichen leshy can adhere to nearly any surface, as though constantly under a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural</a> version of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spider-climb">spider climb</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Filaments_Ex">Filaments (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A lichen leshy can spit a tangle of filaments as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>) and affects the target with the lichen <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-leshy">leshyâs</a> degradation ability. The filaments have a range increment of 20 feet and a maximum range of 100 feet.</p>
<h4><span id="Weathering_Ex">Weathering (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A lichen leshy can release a slow-acting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Acid">acid</a> that dissolves stone and organic material. By remaining in contact with a 5-foot-square area for 8 hours, the leshy can deal 3d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Acid">acid</a> damage to the surface, ignoring <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> less than 10.</p>

<p>Like the curious plantlike organisms from which theyâre composed, lichen leshys are rugged creatures able to survive in unforgiving climates. Unlike most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/leshy-subtype">leshys</a>, lichen leshys are rarely content to stay in one place for long, instead using their survival skills to reach the grandest vistas, harshest environs, and most daring heights. There, they rest in quiet contemplation and awe, slowly breaking down inhospitable rocks into nutrient-rich soil that can sustain new plant life.</p>
<p>Lichen leshys almost always wear cozy rain cloaks that they use to blur their outlines and better camouflage their forms. They often secret away tiny mementos within their garb to remind them of their greatest achievements, and one can earn a lichen leshyâs ready assistance if willing to listen to its rambling tales of how it found each trophy.</p>
<p>This mossy clothing functions as masterwork padded armor for a lichen leshy, but not for any other creature.</p>
<h3><span id="Growing_a_Lichen_Leshy">Growing a Lichen Leshy</span></h3>
<p>A lichen leshy can grow nearly anywhere thatâs exposed to clean air, though most creators prefer large, rocky escarpments. The creator prepares an unguent of spores, aromatic salts, and pure rainwater, which she uses to paint an image of the leshy-to-be on the growing surface. Once the leshy has matured, it peels itself off the prepared surface. Left to its own devices, it can construct its rain cloak and other gear from available materials within a day.</p>

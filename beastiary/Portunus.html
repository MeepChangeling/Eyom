<h4><span id="Alter_Luck_Su">Alter Luck (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>, the portunus can spend a point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power">mythic power</a> to roll its surge die and apply the result as a positive or negative modifier on a d20 roll after the result of the original roll is revealed.</p>
<p>This can change the outcome of the roll. The affected creature must be within 60 feet of the portunus.</p>
<h4><span id="Bonded_Harbor_Ex">Bonded Harbor (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, a portunus attunes itself to a natural bay, fjord, or inlet.</p>
<p>While in its bonded harbor, a portunus is considered to be on its home plane and does not gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Extraplanar">extraplanar</a> subtype. A portunus loses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a> when not on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Water">Plane of Water</a> or within its bonded harbor.</p>
<h4><span id="Boon_Su">Boon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Though a portunus cannot grant spells, it can grant a minor boon to those who properly propitiate it. To receive the boon, a character must perform a 1-minute ritual in or adjacent to the portunusâs bonded harbor and succeed at a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) check. The ritual fails if the portunus is not in its harbor or if it has an attitude of unfriendly or hostile to the supplicant. If the ritual is a success, the character can call upon this boon once within the next 24 hours to roll twice on a skill check and take the better result. A character cannot benefit from more than one boon at a time and cannot attempt this check more than once per day. Granting a boon requires no action by the portunus, and there is no limit on the number of boons it can grant.</p>
<h4><span id="Capsize_Ex">Capsize (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A portunus can attempt to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Capsize-Ex-">capsize</a> a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and attempting a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check. The DC of this check is 25 or equal to the result of the boat captainâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession">Profession</a> (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the portunus, the portunus takes a cumulative â10 penalty on this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check.</p>
<p>The portunus can spend points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power">mythic power</a> (as part of this action) to reduce the penalty by 10 for each point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power">mythic power</a> spent.</p>
<h4><span id="Liquid_Form_Sp">Liquid Form (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a portunus can turn into a mobile pool of water. This functions as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form">gaseous form</a>, except the portunus canât fly in this form, but it can enter water. It retains its base speed, and its swim speed doubles to 120 feet. The portunus can end this ability as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Transparency_Su">Transparency (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A portunusâs body is transparent, rendering it effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> when underwater. It can become visible or transparent at will as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>

<p>Portunuses are a kind of water elemental who inhabit natural harbors. They embody both the regular rising and falling of the tides and the inconstant shifting of the weather. Humanoids who live along bays inhabited by portunuses often revere them as genii loci, and they may give prayers and offerings to the elementals in hopes that their ship will come inâwhether literally or figuratively.</p>
<p>A portunus is naturally invisible underwater, but when it chooses to be seen, it resembles a translucent, statuesque humanoid with four arms and two faces. The portunusâs faces can be the same or different genders. They move about the elementalâs head independently, sometimes facing in opposite directions and at other times cheek to cheek. The portunus can sense and speak from either or both faces, though it has a single mind.</p>
<p>When standing, a portunus towers nearly 24 feet tall and weighs around 12,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Portunuses are rarely seen, even by those who live along the harbors where they dwell. A portunus shows its approval by granting its boon and by using its spell-like abilities to provide unseen aid. If humanoids donât give the proper respect to its harbor, a portunus shows its displeasure with subtle acts of sabotage, such as causing small leaks in ships or rusting away anchor chains. Only if these hints are ignored does the portunus resort to more destructive magic. A portunus revealing its true form is a sign that momentous events are occurring. The portunus may do so to punish a spellcaster who offends the gods or to defend its harborâand its pious residentsâfrom a disaster or invasion. Rarely, a portunus may reveal itself to a fellow servant of nature or fate in order to provide information or assistance.</p>
<p>Portunuses do not actively seek out treasure, but over the years, they may accumulate a hoard from the offerings tossed into their harbor by supplicants and the lost cargo of ships that sink nearby. Even so, those who attempt to salvage a portunusâs treasure find their efforts stymied by the unseen elemental. Yet, a portunus is sometimes willing to give some of its treasure to those in need. Such recipients may never know who their benefactor is, as these gifts appear to be merely washed up on the beach.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>On their native plane, portunuses are most often found where the Plane of Water borders other planes, playing among the storms where it meets the Plane of Air or hiding within the chasms where it meets the Plane of Earth.</p>
<p>Large chunks of other elements floating in the endless sea might also contain hollows where portunuses dwell. On the Material Plane, each portunus is bound to a specific natural harbor, which serves as a link to its home plane. A portunus can leave its bonded harbor, but these excursions are infrequent and usually short.</p>
<p>Though they might be found along any coast, portunuses are most common in regions with many inlets, islands, and fjords.</p>
<p>Portunuses serve as protectors of their harbors and the creatures that live there. While they may be initially wary of humanoids making use of their harbors, most portunuses come to view them as just another part of the bayâs ecosystem, as long as the humanoids are respectful of nature.</p>

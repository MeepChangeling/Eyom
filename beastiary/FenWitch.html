<h1>Fen Witch</h1>
<p class="description">This creature appears as a female humanoid with one nostril, webbed feet and hands, and fiery red eyes. Her body is cloaked in tattered robes of gray or brown. Her hands end in razor-sharp claws and her hair is usually long and unkempt.</p>

<p>Fen witches rarely engage in combat, relying on their death speak ability to slay a creature almost instantaneously (and hopefully drive off the victimâs comrades by instilling fear in any remaining creatures). Failing this, the fen witch prefers direct combat to subterfuge and attacks relentlessly.</p>

<h4><span id="Death_Speak_Su"><a name="TOC-Death-Speak-Su-"></a>Death Speak (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Whether the fen witchâs Death Speak ability is successful or not, the targetâs name remains fresh in her mind for 24 hours. After that, she must use her mind probe ability again to retrieve a creatureâs true name.</p>
<h4><span id="Hag_Ex"><a name="TOC-Hag-Ex-"></a>Hag (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A fen witch counts as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag">hag</a> for the purpose of joining a hagâs coven.</p>
<h4><span id="Horrific_Appearance_Su"><a name="TOC-Horrific-Appearance-Su-"></a>Horrific Appearance (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The sight of a fen witch is so revolting that anyone within 60 feet (other than another fen witch or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag">hag</a>) who sets eyes upon one must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or instantly be weakened, taking 1d8 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Strength damage</a>. Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same fen witchâs horrific appearance for 24 hours. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Mind_Probe_Su"><a name="TOC-Mind-Probe-Su-"></a>Mind Probe (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a fen witch can peer into the mind of a living creature within 60 feet in an attempt to extract the creatureâs true name. The target can resist the mental trespassing by succeeding on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. If the save fails, the fen witch has learned the creatureâs true name and can use her death speak ability. Creatures with an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score of 2 or less and creatures with no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score are immune to this ability. Psionic creatures can use defense modes or other psionic abilities to counter this probe. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same fen witchâs mind probe for one day. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> based.</p>
<h4><span id="Swamp_Stride_Ex"><a name="TOC-Swamp-Stride-Ex-"></a>Swamp Stride (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A fen witch can move through any sort of natural <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#Difficult-Terrain">difficult terrain</a> at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a fen witch normally.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate swamp<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>

<p class="description">This bright-eyed, doll-sized woman wears jewels and silks. She has pointed ears, four-fingered hands, and a mischievous grin.</p>

<h4>Foolâs Inspiration (Su)</h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a danthienne can designate a single <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Monstrous-Humanoid">monstrous humanoid</a> as her companion. An unwilling or unaware target can resist being made a companion by succeeding at a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save, but it is not aware that it was targeted by an effect. The danthienne is constantly aware of her companionâs health, location, and general mood, as if she had cast <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/status">status</a> on the target. So long as she remains within 5 feet, the danthienne can also share spells with her companion, as if it were her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions">animal companion</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/familiar">familiar</a>, and the companion can use the danthienneâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier instead of its own on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> checks and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks.</p>
<p>So long as a creature remains a danthienneâs companion, it automatically takes 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Charisma drain</a> every 24 hours.</p>
<p>A danthienne can dismiss a companion at will, and must do so if she wants to select a new companion. A companion who wishes to break the bond can attempt a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save once per day to do so. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/break-enchantment">break enchantment</a> spell automatically severs this link. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any urban<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or clique (2â4 danthiennes)<br/><b>Treasure</b> double (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Jewelry">jewelry</a> and magic items only)</p>
<p>Rejected from the courts of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> realms, danthiennesâsometimes <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/called">called</a> gossip <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/pixie">pixies</a>ânevertheless delight in courtly intrigue. They adore the trappings of wealth and class, but lack a deeper understanding of politics, and focus most of their energy on personal entertainment and accumulating wardrobes of rich fabrics and random <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Jewelry">jewelry</a>. These tiny <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> spend their time skulking around academies, guilds, and noble courts, stealing valuables and influencing mortal minds to create drama.</p>
<p>When they do reveal their presence, danthiennes portray themselves as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a> granters, offering to make a personâs dreams come true in exchange for services and treasures.</p>
<p>In reality, they have no special gift to grant wishes and rely on their magic, bluffs, and mundane theft to uphold their end of any bargain.</p>
<p>Danthiennes rarely operate alone, usually enticing a desperate courtier into serving them in exchange for popularity.</p>
<p>More rarely, they assemble lesser fey into mock courts, drafting unsuspecting mortals into their sometimes-deadly intrigues. As degenerate, urban cousins of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/nymph">nymphs</a>, they have the ability to bond with mortal creatures and invest them with passion and confidenceâbut the bond is a deadly one, slowly draining the life force from their temporary partners and ultimately leaving them catatonic.</p>
<p>Danthiennes stand just 10 inches tall and weigh only a few pounds, despite their plump forms.</p>

<p>A memory child is an extraplanar being from an unknown plane of existence whose sole purpose is the harvesting and collecting of memories from all of those it encounters. Such memories function as food for the memory child (though it retains all memories collected; that is, they are not actually devoured and do not disappear). Memory children take delight in traveling to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> and so are most often encountered there, especially in places where intelligent creatures reside such as cities and towns.</p>
<p>A memory child waits until the perfect moment to use its abilities. It rarely if ever engages in melee, preferring to flee rather than engage a foe in combat. If possible, it uses its special abilities to make such combat unnecessary.</p>
<p>To the observer, a memory child looks exactly like an ordinary child (male or female) about 7 or 8 years old with delicate features, pale skin, and innocent eyes of blue (all memory children have blue eyes). Regardless of its actual age, a memory child never seems to grow up or grow old.</p>

<h4><span id="Barbed_Blademaster_Ex">Barbed Blademaster (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Moloch is proficient with all weapons. In addition, any piercing or slashing weapon he wields sprouts cruel, wicked barbs that increase the weaponâs critical multiplier by 1 for as long as he wields it. Targets that have fortification gain only half their usual chance of ignoring Molochâs critical hits.</p>
<h4><span id="Call_Weaponry_Su">Call Weaponry (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Moloch can call his weapons Goreletch (a +3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a> <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy">unholy</a> <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/vorpal">vorpal</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/axe-battle">battleaxe</a>) and Ramithaine (a +3 <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/axiomatic">axiomatic</a> <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/cruel">cruel</a> <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy">unholy</a> <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/wounding">wounding</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a>) to his hands at will as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> from any distance (even across <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/planar">planar</a> boundaries). If one of these weapons is destroyed, he can remake it and cause the rebuilt weapon to appear in his hand as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>; if needed, he can instead remake both weapons as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>. Remaking a weapon in this way provokes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>, but <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Calling">calling</a> a weapon does not.</p>
<h4><span id="Fiendish_Furnace_Ex">Fiendish Furnace (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature that comes within 10 feet of Moloch or begins its turn within this area takes 2d8 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/special-hazards/hellfire-cr-3/">hellfire</a> damage (no save). In addition, creatures that strike Moloch in melee are affected by his burn ability unless they succeed at a DC 43 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save. Whenever Moloch would take cold damage, he can choose to block all cold damage from that attack, but doing so causes his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/fiendish">fiendish</a> furnace ability to be negated until the start of his next turn. Choosing to do so is reflexive and does not require any action on Molochâs part. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Incinerate_Su">Incinerate (Su)</span></h4>
<h4><span id="Infernal_Fortress_Su">Infernal Fortress (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, Moloch can cause a towering fortress to erupt from the ground at a point within 30 feet. Treat this ability as if Moloch used an <a class="item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/instant-fortress">instant fortress</a>, save that the fortress is 60 feet square and 90 feet tall, and sized for a Huge inhabitant.</p>
<p>Once created, this fortress is permanent until Moloch uses the ability again, whereupon the previous fortress vanishes; any objects and creatures within the fortress fall to the ground at this time.</p>
<h4><span id="Spirit_of_Hellfire_Su">Spirit of Hellfire (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever Moloch creates an effect that would normally deal fire damage, it instead deals <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/special-hazards/hellfire-cr-3/">hellfire</a> damage. Half of the damage dealt by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/special-hazards/hellfire-cr-3/">hellfire</a> is fire damage, with the other half being <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy">unholy</a> damage that is not reduced by fire <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance">resistance</a> or fire <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Swallow_Whole_Su">Swallow Whole (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever a creature takes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/special-hazards/hellfire-cr-3/">hellfire</a> damage as a result of being swallowed whole by Moloch, it must succeed at a DC 43 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be so overwhelmed with pain that it can do nothing but shriek and wail in agony, and can take no other action; this is a pain effect.</p>
<p>Each round that such a victim shrieks in pain, Molochâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Frightful-Presence-Ex-">frightful presence</a> is automatically activated and he gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> to the save DC to resist its effects. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>

<p>Moloch is the dread general of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hellâs</a> armies, both his own hordes in the pits of Malebolge and the legions serving his lieutenants throughout the plane. He is fiercely loyal to Asmodeus and to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a> itself, and he marshals not only <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil">devils</a> but also lost souls, other denizens of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>, and interplanar mercenaries in brutal, endless campaigns.</p>
<p>He can recount the dispositions and particulars of every military formation in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>, and he brooks no insubordination or disobedience in martial matters, under threat of burning torments that are terrible even by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hellâs</a> standards. Moloch is surprisingly responsive to his mortal worshipers, and he is quite willing to exchange his favor for gifts of provisions, supplies, and soldiers for the infernal armies. Those sacrificed to him in the fires of the mortal world or ritually cremated in his honor after death face an eternity of soldierly slavery in his legions.</p>
<p>Moloch is a hulking <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant">giant</a> of fire and steel, standing 24 feet tall and weighing 5 tons. What appears to be his armor is in fact his flesh, inside which lies nothing but flames, ash, and bits of scorched bone from previous victims. Despite his fiery appearance, he is a cool and professional tactician who has studied war for eons and has put every known tactical theory into practice in the endless war against the celestial hosts and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/fiendish">fiendish</a> rivals of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>.</p>
<h3 class="header"><span id="Molochs_Cult">Molochâs Cult</span></h3>
<p>Moloch is worshiped by warlords and tyrants alike.</p>
<p>Unlike for many archdevils, his worship is often public, with monolithic temple complexes and pits of eternal flame where sacrifices to the Ashen Bull are made to pass through the fire, or their hearts are cut out and burned to sear their courage into the immortal armies that the Lord of the Sixth marshals at the behest of the high lords of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>. His sacred places are altars of blackened stone and twisted iron, replete with massive gongs and braziers to sound the knell of death that war will bring to all.</p>
<p>Molochâs unholy symbol is a shadowed red-and-black bullâs head with a sickly yellow flame within. Although he can use any weapon (and favors the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/axe-battle">battleaxe</a> Goreletch and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a> Ramithaine), his favored weapon is the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/whip">whip</a>, as he prefers his worshipers to drive armies by the lash. He grants access to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil">Evil</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fire">Fire</a>, Law, and War domains, and to the Ash, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil">Devil</a>, Smoke, and Tactics subdomains.</p>

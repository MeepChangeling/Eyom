<h1>Hand of the Inheritor</h1>
<p class="description">This masculine, golden-skinned angel stands taller than the greatest human champion. His halo is a spinning wheel of blades above his head, and with a gesture it flies to his left arm like a deadly spiked shield, while great wings of brilliant energy manifest from his back.</p>

<h4><span id="Truespeech_Su"><a name="TOC-Truespeech-Su-"></a>Truespeech (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The Hand of the Inheritor can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tongues">tongues</a> spell (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> equal to angelâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>). This ability is always active.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any good-aligned plane<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or squad (the Hand plus 2â5 astral devas)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> double (+2 <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Axiomatic">axiomatic</a> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Holy">holy</a> spiked heavy steel shield) </p>
<p>The Hand of the Inheritor is a warrior angel, first to answer his gods call. As fast as the greatest angels, he leads the charge when her celestial armies must go to war. A veteran of countless sorties into the Abyss, the Hand fights with a song of battle on his lips and unbreakable courage in his heart. He looks like a tall, golden-skinned angel with a halo of sword-like blades, which he can also wear on his arm like a spiked shield. He may manifest or hide a pair of feathered wings at will, which may be any color, though he does not actually need them to fly.</p>
<p>The Hand is not a diplomatic angel, and is rarely called upon when the situation requires someone willing to mince words.</p>
<h4><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h4>
<p>The Hand of the Inheritor does not need to eat or sleep, though he is known to take a long pause after a great battle to think about fallen comrades with other veterans.</p>
<p>He sometimes refers to his halo-shield as if it were an independent being, though it acts according to his will; as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> he can pull a +2 longsword from the halo-shield at any time and wield it as a weapon, though the sword vanishes if ever separated from him.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society">Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>The angel focuses on honorable combat, the preservation of just rulers, and valorous deeds. When he is not needed, he guards noble souls through the Astral plane, patrols the borders of his lords realm in search of abominations from the Abyss, duels devils on neutral ground to better learn their tactics, and watches over youths his patron has marked for greatness.</p>
<p>He enjoys battle hymns and marching music, though his voice is more suited for harmonizing with a true performer than leading a song. He is adept at determining if a rampaging monster intends evil or if it is merely hungry, and is merciful enough to only slay the ones intending to do wrong. Likewise, he feels no guilt in slaying those who embrace evil, but strikes to subdue when his opponent is magically controlled or otherwise compromised in his decision-making.</p>

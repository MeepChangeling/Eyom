<p>Alseid are the graceful woodland cousins to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/centaur">centaurs</a>. Because they are rarely seen far from the wooded glades they call home, they are sometimes called âgrove nymphs,â despite being more closely related to elves than <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/nymph">nymphs</a>.</p>
<p>Disrespectful strangers may follow the same tail to their doom. Male alseid have antlers growing from their foreheads. These antlers grow very slowly, branching every 10 years for the first century of life. Further points only develop with the blessings of the forest. No 14-point imperial alseid are known to exist, but many tribes are governed by princes with 13 points. Because antlers signify status, alseid never use them in combat. Cutting an alseid’s antlers is one of the direst punishments an alseid can receive. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">Elf</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">rangers</a> have reported a lone alseid exile, wandering the forest, its antlers sawn off near the scalp.</p>
<p>Alseid have a deep connection with the magic of the forest. Their leaders favor the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">ranger</a> classes.</p>

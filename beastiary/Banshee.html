<h4><span id="Hear_Heartbeat_Ex"><a name="TOC-Hear-Heartbeat-Ex-"></a>Hear Heartbeat (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A banshee can sense the beating hearts of living creatures within 60 feet, as if it had the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Terror_Su"><a name="TOC-Terror-Su-"></a>Terror (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature damaged by the bansheeâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> must make a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. Failure means that the victim cowers in fear for 1d3 rounds. If a target is protected against fear by a dispellable effect (such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heroes-feast">heroesâ feast</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mind-blank">mind blank</a>), the bansheeâs touch attempts to dispel one such effect with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic#greater">greater dispel magic</a> (CL 14th). Negative energy damage caused by a bansheeâs touch can only harm the living; it cannot heal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Wail_Su"><a name="TOC-Wail-Su-"></a>Wail (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per minute, a banshee may wail as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>. The wail lasts until the beginning of her next turn. All creatures within 40 feet of the banshee when she begins her wail, as well as all creatures that end their turn within that radius, must make a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. (This save is only required once per wail.) Creatures under the effects of a fear effect take a â4 penalty on this save. Creatures that make their save are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1d6 rounds. Those that fail take 140 points of damage (as if affected by a CL 14 <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wail-of-the-banshee">wail of the banshee</a>). If a wailing banshee is damaged during a wail, she must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save (DC 15 + damage taken) to maintain the wail; otherwise it ends. This is a sonic death effect. Banshee wails are supernaturally powerful, and penetrate the effect of any spell of 3rd level or lower that creates silence. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

  <h4><span id="Greater_Banshee_CR_15"><a name="TOC-Greater-Banshee-CR-15-"></a>Greater Banshee (CR 15)</span></h4>
<p>When a female <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elven</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a> of at least 10th level perishes under conditions that would normally transform her spirit into a standard banshee, she instead becomes a much rarer and more dangerous variant of the banshee. Known variously as dread banshees, white women, caoineags, or simply as greater banshees, these spirits have the abilities of standard banshees, but with the following three additional abilities. </p>
<h4><span id="Improved_Wail"><a name="TOC-Improved-Wail"></a>Improved Wail</span></h4>
<p>Those who fail to save against a greater bansheeâs wail are slain immediately rather than being reduced to â1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. Any female <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elf</a> slain by a greater bansheeâs wail rises in 1d4 rounds as a banshee under the control of the greater banshee who slew her. These newly created banshees are always standard bansheesâa greater banshee cannot spawn another greater banshee. </p>
<h4><span id="Intelligent"><a name="TOC-Intelligent"></a>Intelligent</span></h4>
<p>Greater banshees retain their minds and are capable of executing long and complex plots to spread death and dismay. A greater banshee has an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score of 16 rather than 5, and gains additional skill points as appropriate for her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score. She gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate">Intimidate</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (any), and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform">Perform</a> as class skills. </p>
<h4><span id="Bardic_Magic"><a name="TOC-Bardic-Magic"></a>Bardic Magic</span></h4>
<p>A greater banshee casts spells as a 10th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>. A typical greater banshee knows the following spells:</p>

<p>A greater banshee is a CR 15 monster, although many of them are advanced in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> beyond the standard banshee, increasing their CR by 1 for each additional 4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> gained. The most powerful greater banshees also have additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a> levelsâthese <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a> levels stack for the purposes of determining what <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> and additional spells the greater banshee has access to. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>A banshee is the enraged spirit of an elven woman who either betrayed those she loved or was herself betrayed. Maddened by grief, a banshee visits her vengeance on all living creaturesâinnocent or guiltyâwith her fearsome touch and deadly wails.</p>
<p>A banshee is the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> spirit of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elven</a> woman who, in her last moments of life, either committed some sort of heinous betrayal of her friends and family or was herself dealt a soul-shattering, torturous death at the hands of those she thought were her allies and loved ones. In either event, the spirit of the slain elf rises with the next sunset as a creature of indiscriminate vengeance whose hatred of the living targets both innocent and guilty with equal ferocity. Only the cleansing rays of true sunlight, a symbol of healing, renewal, and forgiveness, evokes anything resembling fear in these nearly mindless harbingers of death. </p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society">Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>As <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> elves, banshees are generally found in regions where elves are prominent, yet elves find banshees to be shameful and hideous Curses, and swiftly mobilize to destroy those that appear within <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elven</a> society. As a result, most banshees dwell in regions where elves once dwelt but, for whatever reason, were forced to abandon. Curiously enough, banshees rarely if ever rise from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/drow-1">drow</a>âthe right mix of catalysts in a dying <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/drow-1">drow’s</a> soul simply arenât tragic enough when compared to an uncorrupted <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elf</a> who falls to betrayal or mortal sin. </p>

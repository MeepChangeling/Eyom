<h1>Rajput Ambari</h1>
<p class="description">Standing motionless, this creature could easily be mistaken for a huge skeletal display of a long-dead war elephant. At further glance, its eyes burn a smoky black and pieces of stench-ridden flesh hang from crusty bones. Rusty barding drapes loosely over its skeletal spine, and ancient, rotten finery hangs over its skull and drapes flaccidly toward the ground.</p>

<p>Rajput ambaris are completely subservient to their creators and any other creature capable of commanding <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>. A rajput ambari is treated as an undead creature of half its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> for the purposes of being commanded and when counting the total Hit Dice of undead an evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a> has under his control. A rajput ambari always understands the language of its master and anyone controlling it.</p>

<p>Horrors born from the depths of endless jungles, rajput ambari are undead elephants granted terrible powers through necromantic rites. Massive and terrifying, many of these earth-shaking undead behemoths retain the exotic trappings and elegant finery of the princes who once doted upon them. The glory of such beasts is long forgotten, though, as most serve as unholy slaves and fearless beasts of war for uncaring necromancers and deathless masters.</p>
<h3><span id="Creating_a_Rajput_Ambari"><a name="TOC-Creating-a-Rajput-Ambari"></a>Creating a Rajput Ambari</span></h3>
<p>A spellcaster of 18th level or higher can create a rajput ambari utilizing the <i>create undead </i>spell. In addition to the usual components required by the spell, though, the rite to animate a rajput ambari requires the full skeleton of an adult elephant and adornment of a regal bearing. At the very least, these additions add 400 gp to the spellâs total cost.</p>

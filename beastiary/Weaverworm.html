<h1>Weaverworm</h1>
<p class="description">The bloated white segments of a maggotâs body erupt in a torso of mixed feminine and insectile features. Pale humanoid skin and carapace meld together beneath a face with segmented eyes and mandibles chittering a song of discordant alien clicks and hisses, as overlong carapace claws weave cords of thick webbing between them.</p>

<h4><span id="Drag_Ex"><a name="TOC-Drag-Ex-"></a>Drag (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A weaverworm that successfully entangles a victim with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Web-Ex-">web</a> attack can retract the web, dragging the victim into its clutches. Each round, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> victim can attempt a CMD check to escape. Upon a failed check, the weaverworm forcibly drags its victim 20 feet toward it.</p>
<h4><span id="Paralytic_Nails_Ex"><a name="TOC-Paralytic-Nails-Ex-"></a>Paralytic Nails (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A weaverwormâs nails secrete a potent paralytic agent. Any creature damaged by its claw attacks must make a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> for 1 round. In addition, the weaverwormâs nails break off in the bodies of those it paralyzes. A paralyzed creature must make another save to avoid being paralyzed again at the beginning of its round, doing so every round until the nail is removed as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>. A weaverwormâs nail can be removed with either a DC 12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> check, which removes the nail and deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim, or a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> check, which deals no damage. A weaverwormâs paralytic nails donât affect any creature that is immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison">poison</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Weavers_Song_Su"><a name="TOC-Weaver-s-Song-Su-"></a>Weaverâs Song (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A weaverworm can play its webs like a grotesque musical instrument. When doing so, all non-weaverworms within 300 feet must make DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves. Those who make their saves are unaffected. Those who fail are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated">fascinated</a>, and on their turn, move toward the weaverworm by the most direct means available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving throw</a> to end the effect before moving into peril. A victim within 5 feet of the weaverworm simply stands and listens. This effect continues for as long as the weaverworm performs and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the victim is immune to the same weaverwormâs song for 24 hours. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<p>Foul servants of the goddess of disease and gluttony, weaverwormsâor simply âweavers,â as they are often calledâare terrifying abominations, combining the features of predatory insects, monstrously huge larvae, and deathly pale humanoids. Creations forgotten by their cruel mistress long ago, these horrors seek out the dark places of the world, sowing murder and fear from the darkness, and all the while raising unnatural songs in praise of the goddess of gluttony. Weaverworms typically measure 18 feet long, though the most bloated weigh upward of a ton.</p>
<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p>Weaverworms are also know for their clawsâ deadly nails, which function more like the stingers or barbs of many insects than weapons alone. These nails contain a potent paralytic fluid that passes into the bloodstream of a weaverwormâs victim, leaving it vulnerable to slaughter and ready for consumption. The nails often break off while embedded in the victimâs body, where they continue pumping the weaverwormâs toxins, filling potential meals with dose after dose of paralytic excretions. Occasionally, those who encounter a weaverworm and flee find themselves paralyzed well after they think theyâve escaped, again falling into the deadly clutches of the pursuing abomination.</p>
<p>The flesh of the creatureâs underbelly is relatively soft and slightly rubbery, running in shades of sickly brown flesh to pale blue. The exposed carapace is tougher and dotted with thousands of short bristles. Over time the weaverworm adjusts to match whatever environment it dwells in. The upper portion of the creature has a female body, but one disfigured by insectile traits. Such monstrous malformations vary between weavers, though all have deadly claws and heads with a terrible assortment of mandibles, pincers, spines, and segmented eyes. Typically, these appearances are similar to the faces of predatory insects common to the region the weaverworm inhabits, with spider features proving most prevalent, but the visages of horrible mantises and monstrous annelids also arise in warmer climates.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Much like larger arachnids, weaverworms are chiefly ambush hunters. They live in solitary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>s, near or within old ruins and similar places that tend to attract prey. While they tend to avoid colder climes, they prove resilient to most extremes of weather and terrain, tending to choose somewhat isolated areas where their hunting goes unnoticed. Typically, once a weaverworm claims a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>, she remains there for life. In this manner, weaverworms are largely consistent, enough so that they frequently catch the attention of primitive humanoids such as goblins, orcs, or, in particular, ettercaps who believe them the embodiment of various gods or fiends and pay them worship. The relationship between weaverworms and their worshipers tends to be brutal, as weaverworms have few qualms about eating worshipers who come too close.</p>

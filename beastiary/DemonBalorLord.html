<p>A balor lord relies upon its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> to fight foes wise enough to avoid melee range, favoring destructive powers like <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fire-storm">fire storm</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/implosion">implosion</a> and saving <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-monster">dominate monster</a> for use against the rare foe it would prefer to capture alive. A balor usually uses <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/telekinesis">telekinesis</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a> ranged weapons or pull foes into meleeâwith the use of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/quicken-spell-metamagic">quickened</a> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/telekinesis">telekinesis</a>, a balor lord can use the latter tactic and still inflict a full-round attack on a hapless foe. A balor lord reduced to fewer than 50 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> almost always seeks slay a neighboring creature, an ally if neccesary, in order to activate its life drinker <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> ability, otherwise it will flee via <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Teleportation">teleportation</a>, if both these tactics prove impossible it seeks to position itself such that, if it is slain, its death throes are as devastating as possible to the enemy host.</p>

<h4><span id="Rage_Ex">Rage (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>This balor lord can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-">rage</a> for 27 rounds per day, and gains +4 to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>, and -2 to AC</p>
<p><b>Knockback (Ex)</b>: Once per round, the balor lord can make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush">bull rush</a> attempt against one target in place of a melee attack. If successful, the target takes damage equal to the lords’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier and is moved back as normal. The balor lord does not need to move with the target if successful. This does not provoke an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>.</p>
<p><b>Scent (Ex)</b>: The balor lord gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent">scent</a> ability while raging and can use this ability to locate unseen foes.</p>
<h4><span id="Death_Throes_Su">Death Throes (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When killed, a balor lord explodes in a blinding flash of fire that deals 100 points of damage (half fire, half unholy damage) to anything within 100 feet. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save DC 35 halve the damage, this DC increases to 37 if the balor lord was killed in rage as the save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Entangle_Ex">Entangle (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If a balor lord strikes a Medium or smaller foe with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/whip">whip</a>, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/balor">balor</a> can immediately attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check without provoking an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/balor">balor</a> wins the check, it draws the foe into an adjacent square. The foe gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition, but the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/balor">balor</a> does not.</p>
<h4><span id="Flaming_Body_Su">Flaming Body (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A balor lord’s body is covered in dancing flames. Anyone striking a balor with a natural weapon or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a> takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/balor">balor</a> or is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> persists.</p>
<h4><span id="Lifedrinker_Su">Lifedrinker (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal">heal</a> spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per round.</p>
<h4><span id="Vorpal_Strike_Su">Vorpal Strike (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any slashing weapon a balor lord wields (including its standard <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/whip">whip</a>) gains the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Vorpal">vorpal</a> weapon quality. Weapons retain this quality for one hour after the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/balor">balor</a> releases the weapon, but after this the weapon reverts to its standard magical qualities, if any.</p>
<h4><span id="Whip_Mastery_Ex">Whip Mastery (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A balor lord treats a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/whip">whip</a> as a light weapon for the purposes of two-weapon fighting, and can inflict lethal damage on a foe regardless of the foe’s armor.</p>
<p>Even more terrible than the typical balor are those who do not call a demon lord their master, but instead are masters themselves. A balor lord typically rules over a region no larger than half the size of the realm in which it resides (as only full demon lords can command the rule of an entire Abyssal realm), and even though most balor lords rule much smaller regions (generally areas comparable in size to a single continent), their power is vast indeed.</p>
<p>A balor lord is typically a CR 21 to CR 25 monster (a range shared with the various unique nascent demon lords, with the range of CR 26 and above being the domain of the demon lords themselves), and as such serves quite well as the final villain in a long-running campaign. The majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger (although ranger balor lords never form bonds with animals), but some instead have levels of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard. Cleric balor lords are unknown, as they see themselves as objects of worship, not the other way around, although rumors persist of powerful balor clerics that directly serve demon lords or even evil gods.</p>
<h3><span id="Additional_Special_Abilities">Additional Special Abilities</span></h3>
<p class="source"><b>Source</b> PCS:DR</p>
<p>In addition to any benefits a balor lord might gain from its class levels, all balor lords possess one additional unique ability over and above those granted by its race and class. Listed here are three sample balor lord abilities, but these samples are by no means the entirety of the strange powers a balor lord might wield.</p>
<h4><span id="Angelslayer_Su">Angelslayer (Su)</span></h4>
<p>All weapon damage the balor lord inflicts, be it via <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> or wielded weapons, is treated as chaotic, evil, and epic for the purposes of overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> and halting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a>.</p>
<p>The balor lord automatically confirms all critical hits against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">angels</a>, and gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> to its AC and on all saving throws against attacks made by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">angels</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Lifedrinker_Su-2">Lifedrinker (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal" rel="nofollow">heal</a> spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per round. </p>
<h4><span id="Master_of_Magic_Su">Master of Magic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The balor lord has additional spell-like abilities (20 spell levels’ worth of 1stâ4th level spells usable at will and 20 spell levels’ worth of 5thâ8th level spells usable 3 times a day). </p>
<h4><span id="Soul_Swallow_Su">Soul Swallow (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a standard action, the balor lord can inhale the soul of a living creature within 30 feet. The target must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save (DC 10 + 1/2 balor lord’s racial HD + the balor lord’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha">Charisma</a> modifier) or die. The body of a humanoid creature killed in this manner immediately transforms into a demon under the balor lord’s command (a babau, succubus, or shadow demon, according to the balor lord’s whim).</p>
<h4><span id="Stormlord_Su">Stormlord (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The balor’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, death throes, and flaming body abilities can inflict electricity damage instead of fire damage, as appropriateâthe balor lord can decide to adjust its fire damage in this way instantaneously. Electricity resistance is halved against this electricity damage, and electricity <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> is treated as resist electricity 20. Up to once per round when the balor lord is targeted by electricity damage, it can choose to heal damage equal to the amount of electricity damage caused rather than simply be immune to the damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Swarm-Infested_Su">Swarm-Infested (Su)</span></h4>

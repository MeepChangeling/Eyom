<h4>Penetrating Question (Su)</h4>
<p>A luma can compel its victims to reveal deeply painful, intensely personal secrets merely by asking in a tone of mind-voice that cannot be denied. These questions are always designed to disturb the victim, or erode the trust and respect of any allies who hear the question (and response).</p>
<p>If the luma knows that its interrogation can trigger past emotional trauma, so much the better.</p>
<p>As a ranged attack action, the luma makes a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check (rather than a normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a>) against a single target within 30 ft. The target suffers damage of an unspecified energy type that bypasses all form of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo---rage-powers/energy-resistance-ex">energy resistance</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the target fails a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save with a DC equal to the lumaâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check result, the target must answer the stated question truthfully.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>, language-dependent, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any urban<br/><b>Organization</b> often accompanied by humanoid minions, using various low-level rogues<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (in lair)</p>
<p>Luma are sadistic blackmailers and spymasters. Extremely bigoted, luma believe that lesser intellects have no right to private thoughts or secret shames. The creatures are obsessive diarists, spending most of each day recording meticulous notes on every intelligent creature in their orbit â their secrets, their habits and schedules, the results of mind probes and torture. Luma collect secrets and actionable intelligence like a dragon hoards gold. The creatures do not eat in the conventional sense, and raping information from an unwilling mind somehow nourishes them.</p>
<p>Luma rarely work with others of their kind, but on the rare occasion they cross a fellow lumaâs path, the creatures are surprisingly gregarious. The two luma joyfully link minds and fully share their collection of secrets, a process that can take weeks for particularly well informed luma. Luma prefers to work with humanoids it controls through bribery, intimidation and blackmail, and the creatures often become the head of vast criminal conspiracies or established thieves guilds.</p>
<p>Luma are roughly child-sized reptiles. Their enormous eyes stare like blood-red lanterns in the dark. Their fleshy pink hides thicken to leathery ridges across their spine. This denser, gnarled flesh is the color of an old scab.</p>

<p>A terra-cotta soldier is crafted from clay and fired into ceramic, and is usually sculpted to resemble an armored <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> soldier, although terra-cotta soldiers resembling other races, such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/hobgoblin">hobgoblins</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/tengu">tengus</a>, or even <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a>, are also common. Terra-cotta soldiers are often created to guard the tomb of powerful rulers, standing in silent ranks to guard their liege even after his or her death. These soldiers stand vigil for centuries, animating only to defend the tomb and its riches from tomb robbers. Terra-cotta soldiers are typically painted with colored lacquer, though this decoration is often worn away from use or faded with age. A terra-cotta soldier stands 6 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.</p>

<h3><span id="Variants">Variants</span></h3>
<p>Unlike most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, a terra-cotta soldier carries within its form a spark of intelligence. This is hardly enough to grant the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> the ability to speak or otherwise engage in free will, but it is enough for it to carry out more complex tactics than most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> are capable of. It’s not unusual for a terra-cotta soldier to possess different feats or use different weapons. Two relatively common variants are summarized below.</p>

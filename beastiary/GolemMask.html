<h1>Golem, Mask</h1>
<p class="description">This creature is made of hundreds of metal masks, welded together to form a roughly humanoid body. The masks are mostly iron, but someâsuch as the hands, knees, and feetâ are made of silver lined with gold. The mask that makes up its head is made of porcelain with gold trim and has a large sapphire set into its brow. At the creature moves, the masks seem to shift and stare.</p>

<p><b>During Combat</b> A mask golem attempts to control any powerful melee combatant that moves to threaten it using its mask of obedience ability. Against ranged opponents, it uses its mask of solitude. If these do not work, it relies on its slam attacks instead.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> A mask golem fights to defend the area it has been built to protect, even if this results in its destruction.</p>

<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex"><a name="TOC-Immunity-to-Magic-Ex-"></a>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mask golem is immune to any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> that allows <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shatter">shatter</a> spell deals 4d6 points of damage (no save).</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/grease">grease</a> spell prevents the mask golem from using its masks of control ability for the duration of the spell (no save). Masks that are already in place are unaffected.</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/make-whole">make whole</a> spell heals the golem as normal and automatically restores one of its masks of control if any have been destroyed.</li>
<li>Any magical attack against a mask golem that deals sonic damage affects the mask golem normally.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Masks_of_Control_Su"><a name="TOC-Masks-of-Control-Su-"></a>Masks of Control (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a mask golem can force one of its masks onto a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> opponent’s face. This ability has a range of 30 feet. Attaching a mask in this way requires a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check and does not provoke an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. Once in place, the mask has one of two effects.</p>
<p><i>Obedience</i>: The target must make a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save each round or fall under the mask golem’s control for 1 round. This functions as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-person">dominate person</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><i>Solitude</i>: The target cannot speak, breathe, or hear while the mask is in place.</p>
<p>The mask can be removed with a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check against the mask <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a>‘s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a>. The mask can also be destroyed, but half of any damage dealt is made to the target instead of the mask. The mask has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">Hardness</a> 5 and 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. A mask golem has a number of masks equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (usually 4). If removed from a victim, the mask returns to the golem immediately and can be used again.</p>
<p>Destroyed masks are replenished at the rate of 1 per day.</p>
<h4><span id="Swarm_Form_Ex"><a name="TOC-Swarm-Form-Ex-"></a>Swarm Form (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a mask <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> can assume the form of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> of masks. While in this form, it gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> subtype, a fly speed of 60 feet (average), a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Distraction-Ex-">distraction</a> quality (DC 12). Anyone who takes damage from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> attack can also be attacked with one of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a>‘s masks of control as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> (assuming the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> has enough masks available). The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> is made up of Tiny creatures, but does not gain any additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>. A mask golem can maintain this form for a number of minutes equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. Any damage dealt to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> is subtracted from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a>‘s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, as normal.</p>
<p> Editor’s Note 
<p>Unlike a standard golem, this golem has an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Intelligence_Int">Intelligence</a> score, yet retains the standard golem immunity to mind-affecting effects. GM’s may want to consider removing this immunity to better balance the creature to its given Challenge Rating (or, alternatively, increasing the Challenge Rating by +1 or +2.)</p>
<p>GM’s should carefully consider the capabilities of this golem before using it, as its abilities are extremely powerful for its listed Challenge Rating.</p>

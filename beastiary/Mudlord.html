<p>Mudlords are agile creatures made of living mud. Some are natural elemental creatures, and others were created by long-term mixing of earth and magical water, such as by an enchanted fountain or pool leaking into the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>Regardless of their origin, mudlords are xenophobic and highly territorial. They avoid contact with humanoid creatures, and go to great lengths to ensure their mud-filled lairs are far from any humanoid settlements. If a group of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> settles too close to a mudlord enclave, the mudlords aggressively attempt to eradicate the humanoid infestation from their lands.</p>
<p>Because its natural form is a loose pile of mud and it can flatten itself even further, a common mudlord tactic is to blend in with a swamp, quicksand, or other depression in the earth (using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Freeze-Ex-">freeze</a> ability to resemble a mud puddle) and wait for intruders to approach.</p>
<p>Among their own kind, mudlords are rambunctious and playful, engaging in wrestling matches, mud-throwing contests, and races. They have been known to ally with earth, mud, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental/elemental-water">water elementals</a>, but consider themselves the superiors in these alliances because of their greater intelligence. Exceptional mudlords often become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druids</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle">oracles</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">rangers</a>, and are more tolerant of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>, often accepting tribute from tribes of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/boggard">boggards</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin">goblins</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/lizardfolk">lizardfolk</a> in exchange for truces. Some arise from contaminated sources (such as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon">demon</a> imprisoned in water) and these might ally themselves with fiends, slimes, or other strange creatures.</p>
<p>A typical mudlord stands 7 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.</p>

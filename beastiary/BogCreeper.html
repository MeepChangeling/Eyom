<p>The bog creeper is a creature native to the thickest, darkest swamps. It superficially resembles a man-sized rotted tree trunk sprouting several thorny tendrils each about 10 feet long and a single 6-foot long limb. Bog creepers are carnivorous, lurking amid dead trees and stumps waiting to ambush unsuspecting prey. The shattered boles and stumps make perfect camouflage for the sly bog creeper.</p>
<p>Marshes and swamps are home to the bog creeper and it moves through the territory with ease; it can swim the waters and shamble across the rare patches of dry or swampy ground in pursuit of its prey.</p>
<p>The treasure of a bog creeper is located in its pulpy gullet, and consists of the inorganic, indigestible remains and possessions of its victims.</p>
<p>A bog creeper attacks by ambushing its prey, lying in wait for someone or something to wander nearby. When prey comes within range, it lashes out with its single limb and slashes with its tendrils. It uses its tendrils to grab prey and either constrict it or transfer it to its mouth where it bites with its toothy maw. A desperate bog creeper can also vomit forth its powerful digestive sap in order to dispatch its opponents.</p>

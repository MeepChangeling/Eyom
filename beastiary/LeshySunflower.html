<p>Sunflower leshys reflect the sun and other sources of bright light from their faces onto all who come too close.</p>
<p>Any creature within 20 feet of a sunflower leshy must succeed at a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> for 1d4+1 rounds. A creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> once cannot be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> again by the same <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-leshy">leshy</a> for 24 hours. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Seed_Spray_Ex">Seed Spray (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day, a sunflower leshy can spray seeds in a 15-foot cone as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. The spray deals 1d4 points of piercing damage to all targets in its area of effect. Against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> targets, this attack instead deals 1d6 points of piercing damage. A successful DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saving throw halves the damage from this attack.</p>
<p>The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any warm plains or hills<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, bunch (3â8), or field (9+)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A circle of petals radiates from a sunflower leshyâs head, ranging in color from soft butter yellow to bright orange to plum with white tips. Serrated green leaves sprout like a ruff beneath its head. A sunflower leshy stands 4 feet tall and weighs 75 pounds.</p>
<p>Among the most social of leshys, sunflower leshys serve as the ambassadors and diplomats of leshykind.</p>
<p>They enjoy socializing and interacting in groups of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/leshy-subtype">leshys</a> or with other creatures. Solitary sunflower leshys are rare, as their need for companionship compels them to find others with whom to interact. Leshys who lack companionship for 1 week lose their petals and heliotrope aura as a result of being depressed. Being welcomed back into a group restores the aura in a day and petals after 1 week.</p>
<p>Sunflower leshys are peacemakers and shun martial activities and conflict unless forced into confrontation.</p>
<p>To avoid altercations with unfriendly creatures, they band together and trust that the presence of their heliotrope aura protects them.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/leshy-subtype">leshys</a> look to them to serve as mediators and help resolve differences.</p>
<h3><span id="Growing_a_Sunflower_Leshy">Growing a Sunflower Leshy</span></h3>
<p>Sunflower leshys grow in open fields under bright sunlight.</p>
<p>To grow a sunflower leshy, the maker plants a seed from an extant sunflower leshy and waters it daily. The maker must talk to the seedling daily to encourage the leshyâs growth. The conversation must be upbeat and positive; otherwise, the leshy emerges with withered petals and a permanent frown.</p>

<h1>Blood Golem</h1>
<p class="description">This creature looks like a hideous, bloated slug, blood red in color. Two long spindly arms protrude from its upper body. It has no other discernible features.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Blood-Consumption-Su-"></a>Blood Consumption (Su)</h4>
<p> Each time a blood golem hits a living opponent with a slam attack, it gains a number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> equal to the damage dealt. These bonus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> are added to the blood golemâs total even if the addition takes it above its current maximum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. A blood golem cannot gain more <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> than the maximum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> allowed by its HD (not including any bonus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> it may have from its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> score). For example, a 7-HD blood golem cannot gain more than 56 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>.</p>
<p>If a blood golem successfully hits an opponent with both of its slam attacks in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking 2d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> (DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save for half). A blood golem gains 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> per point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> it deals. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based and includes a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Cell-Division-Ex-"></a>Cell Division (Ex)</h4>
<p> When a blood golem absorbs enough blood to raise its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> to the maximum for its HD, it splits into two identical blood golems, each with half the originalâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. For example, a 7-HD blood golem that reaches 56 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> splits into two 7-HD blood <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golems</a> with 28 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> each.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Vulnerability-to-Magic-Ex-"></a>Vulnerability to Magic (Ex)</h4>
<p> A blood golem is slowed (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds by any cold-based attacks or effects.</p>
<p>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/purify-food-and-drink"><i>purify food and water</i></a> spell deals 1d6 points of damage per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> (maximum 10d6) to a blood golem. A blood golem can attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw (DC 10 + casterâs ability score modifier) to reduce the damage by half.</p>

<p>Blood golems, contrary to their name, are not constructs: they are slugshaped clots of living blood, animated by some ancient ritual by a now unknown and unremembered spellcaster. A typical blood golem is 10 feet long and weighs 700 pounds.</p>
<p>When living prey is detected, the blood golem rises up and appears as a slug-like headless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>. It attacks with its arms. When a blood golem reaches its maximum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> for its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>, it splits into two identical golems.</p>
<p>A blood golemâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>.</p>

<h1>Woghemoth</h1>
<p class="description">In addition to the two long, feathery fins streaming from the rear of this eel-like monstrosity, four fins radiate from the pectoral area of the pale-white body. Though eyeless, the creature flashes unerringly through the water towards its potential meal, opening a mouth filled with razor sharp teeth. As it swims, electricity crackles along its fins.</p>

<p>Woghemoths employ straightforward tactics and attack almost anything that moves through their waters, including (in times of poor hunting) each other. As they charge in, they release their electrical attack.</p>
<p>As soon as they are injured they flee, but combatants should not be fooled into thinking a fleeing woghemoth is defeated. They mindlessly charge in a few seconds later, as soon as they have built up another electrical charge.</p>

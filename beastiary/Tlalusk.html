<h4>Bellowing Blast (Ex)</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a tlalusk can create powerful sonic vibrations in a 60 foot cone. All creatures in the area are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deafened</a> for 1 day. A successful DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save negates the stunning and reduces the deafness to 1 round. A tlalusk can use this ability every 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p>This elephantine creature is shaggy and six-legged. Oversized tusks grow from its mouth, and curling horns rise from its brow.</p>
<p>Tlalusks are creatures of the tundra that supplement their diet of lichens and shrubs with energy derived from elemental cold. As such, they can live year-round in remote and desolate places, and are sometimes even found on other planes. They are semi-intelligent and social organisms. Even those that live alone use infrasound to communicate across miles and miles of terrain. They are incredibly loud when they vocalize at levels humanoids can hear, and can deafen creatures with directed blasts of sound. This bellow is as much a distress call as anythingâonce it is sounded, other tlalusks that can hear it may come to investigate and trample intruders.</p>
<p>Because of their speed, durability and ease of feeding, tlalusks are sought out by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/giant-frost">frost giants</a> as mounts and beasts of burden. Tlalusks can either be cowed into service through violence or bribed with tasty treats and ample mating opportunities. Tlalusks need calcium to build their horns and tusks, and so eat plenty of bones despite their general herbivory. Smart <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants">giants</a> keep their tlalusk steeds well fed with bone meal, otherwise their horns grow soft and the beasts are more likely to try to revolt.</p>

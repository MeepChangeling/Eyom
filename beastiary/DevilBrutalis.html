<h4><span id="Bardic_Performance_Su">Bardic Performance (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A brutalis devil can inspire courage or inspire competence as a 13th-levelÂ <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>. It always uses <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform">Perform</a> (oratory) when making a performance.</p>
<h4><span id="Hatespeech_Su">Hatespeech (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A brutalis devil can make attempt a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform">Perform</a> (oratory) check, requiring at least one minute, to whip a crowd of Neutral or friendlier NPCS into a frenzy.</p>
<ul>
<li>+1d6 if the hated target or group has committed a recent, notorious crime in the area</li>
<li>+1d6 if the brutalis devil merely asks the crowd to stand aside and allow the devil to kill or torture the target, rather than take direct action themselves</li>
<li>+1d4 if the brutalis devil can phrase its hatespeech in religious terms the group believes in</li>
<li>+5 if the brutalis devil uses its mass bullâs strength ability to empower the mob</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone in the crowd opposes the brutalis devil, they can attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform">Perform</a> (oratory) themselves. Doing so sets the check DC for the ability to their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform">Perform</a> (oratory) result if it is higher than DC 15. If the brutalis devil uses this ability again, the mood of the prior crowd suddenly shifts, and they are no longer (unnaturally) consumed with hatred for their target.</p>
<h4><span id="Vigilante_Justice_Su">Vigilante Justice (Su)</span></h4>
<p>If a brutalis devil personally slays a creature (or member of a group) targeted by its hatespeech ability, it recovers 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hp</a> per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> of the target if wounded. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">Hp</a>Â in excess of its normal maximum are gained as temporary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hp</a>, which remain for one hour.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Extraplanar">extraplanar</a>)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or accompanied by a lynch mob of whipped-up commoners and brawlers (usually 4d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/npc-classes/warrior">warrior</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/npc-classes/commoner">commoner</a> 3-5)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (including gear)</p>
<p>Brutalis devils embody the concept of âmight makes rightâ.</p>
<p>These brutish, sadistic thugs encourage the most brutal and draconian forms of law â merciless rule where any infraction if punished by public torture and execution. They revel in the brutality of police and civic watches, encourage nobles to test newly commissioned swords on the first peasants that offend them.</p>
<p>The least intelligent and ambitious Brutalis devils content themselves with stirring up lynch mobs and fermenting hate crimes. Older and more ambitious Brutalis devils set their sights higher. If their passionate and legally-sound but monstrous arguments can put into place systems of discrimination and oppression that will last for generations, the act greatly advances their stations in Hellâs hierarchy.</p>
<p>To advance Hellish law throughout the realms, Brutalis devils often become court advisers, military officers or royal executioners in lawful evil nations, working openly as an emissary of Hell.</p>
<p>Brutalis devils are enormous and sinewy, standing around ten feet tall and weighing tons. Their sandpaper hides are a dull golden, and their shoulders and the crown of their heads are crested with horns. They carry enormous swords of cruel flame. Brutalis devils carry themselves like soldiers, standing at a menacing parade rest most of the time, except when fighting or orating. They have deep, somber voices. A quirk of infernal magic means that their voice always sounds exactly like the father of whoever hears them.</p>

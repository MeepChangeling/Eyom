<h1>Bonethorn</h1>
<p class="description">Ligaments of stringy black fungus connect the bones of this filthy skeleton. In numerous places, the fungus has formed thorny growths.</p>

<h4><span id="Critical_Implantation_Ex">Critical Implantation (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If a bonethorn scores a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> with any of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a>, the victim takes a â4 penalty on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to resist the spore effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Positive_Energy_Absorption_Sp">Positive Energy Absorption (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>Those attempting to affect a bonethorn with positive energy quickly discover their mistake. Not only does positive energy <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal">heal</a> the bonethorn (as it is a living creature, not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>), but it also absorbs the positive energy, boosting its metabolism. Whenever a bonethorn is affected by positive energy, it gains the benefits of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a> 5 for 1 round. This duration increases to 2 rounds if the bonethorn is not wounded at the time it is affected by positive energy. The durations from multiple exposures to positive energy effects stack.</p>
<h4><span id="Spores_Su">Spores (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Each time a bonethorn deals damage with its sporeladen <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a>, its victim must attempt a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to avoid becoming infested by the fungus. If the victim fails, the fungus swiftly propagates through its body, erupting from wounds and ripping through undamaged flesh, dealing 2d6 points of slashing damage per round at the start of the infected creatureâs turn. A creature that has a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a> and that dies while infested with bonethorn spores is consumed over the course of 2d6 rounds, after which a new bonethorn rises from the remains. A new bonethorn created in this manner from a Large or larger body can animate only a Medium-sized portion of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a>, resulting in strange, partially skeletal hosts that have similar statistics to a bonethorn grown from a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> host. Burning or otherwise completely destroying the victimâs body before the spores complete their consumption prevents it from becoming a new bonethorn. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, gang (2â6), or pack (7â12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Bonethorns form from bodies devoured and reanimated by a hideous, flesh-eating fungus.</p>
<p>After consuming a creatureâs flesh, the fungus binds to the bones and takes the place of the bodyâs muscular system. As the fungus spreads across the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a>, it solidifies into numerous raised spikes used to implant fungal spores into other living creatures. Once permanently affixed, it uses the host <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a> to move around so as to spread spores and create more bonethorns.</p>
<p>A bonethorn has a rudimentary intellect, but spends most of its time <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/seeking">seeking</a> new hosts. When flesh isnât available, the fungus goes dormant and can remain so for hundreds of years. While dormant, the bonethorn is inanimate. As soon as the fungus senses life, it reanimates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a>âan action easily <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a> for a corpse rising from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a>. This can fool <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">clerics</a> into trying to turn the creatures, which absorb the positive energy to their benefit.</p>
<p>A typical bonethorn is 6 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds.</p>

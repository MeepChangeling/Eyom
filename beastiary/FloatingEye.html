<p>Floating eyes are small saltwater fish that have transparent bodies and a single large eye about the size of a walnut located in the center of their body. Floating eyes are most often found underground in forgotten dungeon waterways and underground lakes and seas. The creatureâs eye is capable of bioluminescence, and it has such minute control over the intensity and patterns of the light that it can mesmerize other creatures that see it. Floating eyes are part of an unusual symbiotic relationship with a variety of predatory fish, including sharks. Once the floating eye has mesmerized its prey, predatory fish move in and consume it. After they have eaten, the floating eye moves in and gorges itself on the scraps.</p>
<p>Floating eyes avoid combat, relying on their hypnotic gaze ability. If forced into combat, they bite an opponent.</p>

<h1>Badger, Deep</h1>
<p class="title">Deep Badger <span class="level">CR 5</span></p>
<p class="description">This fierce looking terrestrial creature strongly resembles a badger, but is far larger and more feral, its fur littered through with bits of dirt and soil.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Deep badgers dig around their prey, making the area into difficult terrain for creatures that lack a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> speed.</p>

<p><b>Morale</b> Deep badgers fight to the death to defend their territory; if encountered elsewhere, a deep badger flees at 12 hp or less.</p>

<p>Deep badgers are as stubborn, territorial, and unlikeable as their dvergr keepers, and unlike their cousins on the surface these weasels grow to enormous sizes, becoming as large as a horse by maturity. To survive underground, deep badgers hunt down entire packs of creatures, picking them off one at a time and gorging on the prey of its kin (consuming enough food for months at a time with each feeding). The only time one of these beasts can be safely approached after it has completely filled its gullet, and even master dvergr animal tamers are wont to deal with a thin deep badger.</p>
<p>Mature deep badgers stand 4 to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh between 1,000 and 2,000 pounds.</p>

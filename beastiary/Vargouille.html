<h4>Kiss (Su)</h4>
<p>A vargouille can kiss a helpless target by making a successful melee touch attack (this provokes attacks of opportunity). A kissed opponent must succeed on a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or begin a terrible transformation that changes the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the transformation). First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim’s hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Intelligence_Int">Intelligence</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-" rel="nofollow">drain</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha">Charisma</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-" rel="nofollow">drain</a> equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours thereafter, when the victim’s head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation’s progress is paused by sunlight or any light spell of 3rd level or higher, but stopping the transformation requires <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease" rel="nofollow">remove disease</a></i> or a similar effect. The transformation is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.</p>
<h4>Poison (Su)</h4>
<p>Biteâinjury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 12; <i>frequency</i> once; <i>effect</i> damage caused by bite can only be healed with magic if the spellcaster succeeds on a DC 20 caster level check; <i>cure</i> 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<h4>Shriek (Su)</h4>
<p>Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended mouth to shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see the creature must succeed on a DC 12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same vargouille’s shriek for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> pair, cluster (3â6), or mob (7â12))<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A vargouille is larger than a human head, typically between 12 and 20 inches high with a 15- to 35-inch wing span. Vargouilles are not natives of the Material Plane but can often be found there nevertheless, occupying graveyards, ancient battlefields, or anywhere one can find remnants of death and decay. These hideous monsters come from the fiendish outer planes, where they flop and flap through strange and haunted skies in constant search of fresh souls to torment. In these nightmare realms, vargouilles play a role similar to that of a raven or vulture, although they augment these roles with a malevolent delight in causing pain and anguish that no scavenger bird could ever hope to match.</p>
<p>Vargouilles attack by swooping in on their opponents, shrieking them into paralysis, and then biting them with rows of razor-sharp teeth. When multiple vargouilles take up a common cause and fight as allies, they overwhelm their victim with bites and shrieks, tearing it to shreds.</p>

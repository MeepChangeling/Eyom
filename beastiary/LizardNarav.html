<h1>Lizard, Narav</h1>
<p class="description">This bulky smooth-scaled lizard has a long prehensile tail that gently sways as it moves. A ribbon-like tongue flicks out from its wide maw.</p>

<h4><span id="Autotomic_tail_Ex">Autotomic tail (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A narav can detach its tail from its body as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>. This deals 1d6 points of damage to the narav, but thereafter the narav’s tail can act on its own for a number of minutes equal to the narav’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> score. A narav that is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> or pinning a creature can detach its tail at the start of its turn before making a check to maintain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>. This allows the detached tail to maintain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pin</a> while freeing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/lizard/lizard-common">lizard</a> to take other actions.</p>
<p>While detached, a narav’s tail acts on the narav’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative">initiative</a> count as a separate <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/medium">Medium</a>-sized creature. Blind and effectively mindless, the tail gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Tremorsense-Ex-">tremorsense</a> with a 5-foot range and attacks any adjacent creature other than the narav that detached it. The tail has the same statistics as the narav except as follows: Size <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/medium">Medium</a>, AC 16, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> 10, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a> 14; hp 8; <b>Immune</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effects; Speed 0 ft.; Melee tail slap +7 (1d8+4 plus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a>); Space 5 ft., Reach 5 ft.; <b>CMB</b> +7 (+11 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>), <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> 19 (can’t be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip">tripped</a>); <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Int</a> -.</p>
<h4><span id="Lesser_Bite_Ex">Lesser Bite (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Naravs’ jaws lack the powerful musculature of its tail. The narav’s bite attack only adds 1/2 its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> bonus on damage rolls.</p>
<h4><span id="Regrow_Limb_Ex">Regrow Limb (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Naravs can regrow a lost limb or tail.</p>
<p>This regenerative process takes one month during which time the narav requires roughly 50% more food than normal. As long as a narav’s detached tail remains active, it can reattach to the creature’s body if pressed firmly against the creature’s tail stub for at least 1 minute. In this case, the narav cannot use its tail for 24 hours while its internal structures rebind and recover. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate">regenerate</a> spell or an effect that grants the narav the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> universal monster ability removes this recovery period.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate or warm forests and plains<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or lounge (3-12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The narav lizard was one of the first creatures domesticated. Naravs are employed as working beasts or mounts, and also bred for their hide which produces a tough but supple leather. Narav lizard meat is tough, stringy, and tasteless; most Kylornians would only consider eating it in exceptional circumstances. A typical adult narav stands between 4 and 5 feet high at the shoulder, is 16 feet long from snout to end of tail and weighs around 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Naravs live for about 30 years, they lay clutches of around 10 eggs and bury them, these hatch after 8 months of incubation.</p>
<p>Naravs are frugivorous, enjoying a diet of fruit or berries when available, but can subsist on meat or other plant life if necessary. The consistent environment of the Sunset lands suits the narav lizard’s ectothermic nature, giving it ample opportunity to regulate its temperature and bask in sunlight.</p>
<p>Naravs are natural herd animals, banding together for mutual protection. Naravs are able to rear up on their hind legs while stationary. A lounge of wild naravs usually station at least one lookout, who rises up to monitor the area for danger. When the group is threatened, one or more adult naravs use their tails to restrain the intruder while the lounge either flees or attacks the foe in concert. Domesticated naravs are loyal and curious beasts, and often approach other creatures simply to investigate them.</p>

<p>A narav companion’s detached tail is one size category smaller than the narav.

Detaching the tail deals 1 point of damage per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> of the narav, and the detached tail has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> equal to twice the narav companion’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>.</p>

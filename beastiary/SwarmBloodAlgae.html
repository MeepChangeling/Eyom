<p>Once every 2d4 rounds as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> while underwater, a blood algae <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> can release a cloud of red pigment in a 10-foot radius centered on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a>. In this area, the water turns blood red and becomes opaque, blocking vision as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/o/obscuring-mist">obscuring mist</a>. The pigment persists for 3 rounds before dispersing. The pigment colors the skin and clothes of any creature within the area a blood-red color for 1d4 hours, at which time the pigment fades. Scrubbing for several minutes with strong alcohol also removes the pigment.</p>
<h4><span id="Cling_Ex">Cling (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If a creature leaves a blood algae swarmâs square, several of the squirming creatures continue to cling to the victim. A creature with blood algae clinging to it takes 2d6 points of damage at the end of its turn each round. The creature can remove the algae with a successful DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>. Any amount of damage from an area effect destroys all clinging algae, and the clinging algae also drop off automatically if the victim leaves the water or moves more than 30 feet from the blood algae swarm. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate or warm rivers<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or colony (2â6)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Blood algae swarms are diurnal, floating toward the waterâs surface in sunny weather and sinking to the bottom at night. These creatures absorb some nutrients directly from the water, but to survive longer periods of time, they must feed on living creatures such as crustaceans, fish, or mammals. Blood algae attach themselves to their preyâs skin, inserting needlelike protrusions in the flesh, through which they can feed.</p>
<p>Because blood algae <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarms</a> can color the water red, there are many superstitious beliefs in Taldor about evil spirits that turn the water into blood to punish people.</p>

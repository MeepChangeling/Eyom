<h4><span id="Vulnerability_to_Sunlight_Ex"><a name="TOC-Vulnerability-to-Sunlight-Ex-"></a><b>Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)</b></span></h4>

<p>When mortal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> find themselves exposed to profound, supernatural evil, a horrific, occult transformation can strip them of their souls and damn them to the tortured existence of a bodak. Changed into a twisted, misanthropic husk, a bodak wanders the endless tracts of evil-aligned planes, periodically stumbling into other realms by passing through portals or otherwise being conjured elsewhere. Possessing only fragmented memories of its former existence, the bodak is driven by profound emptiness, sorrowful longing, and vengeful hatred of all life. A bodakâs appearance is profoundly disturbing. Its flesh looks dried, taut, and desiccated, though it possesses a strange, otherworldly sheen. Its body is disproportionate and distinctly androgynous. Hairless and with only vague hints of facial structure, the bodakâs eyes are deep set in their sockets and constantly weep foul-smelling smoky vapors. A planes-wise traveler who recognizes its shape knows to flee, for most travelers can outrun the relatively slow bodak.</p>
<p>Bodaks vehemently despise all living creatures and immediately seek to destroy any they encounter. A bodak retains the ability to speak one language it knew in life (typically Common), but it rarely engages in conversation, instead spitting out an incomprehensible stream of vile accusations, curses, and threats. On occasion, a bodak might wield weapons, but most rely primarily upon the effects of their deadly gaze. Bodaks are rarely encountered outside of the Abyss. As they are slow-witted, powerful evil creatures such as liches and nabasu demons sometimes use bodaks as thralls, assassins, or guardians. Bodaks encountered on the Material Plane exude extreme malevolence when forced to confront the realization of their abhorrent transformations. So great is their desire to fascinate ability their fate upon others that many attempt to drag off the bodies of their slain victims and guard them until they rise as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>.</p>
<p>A 20th-level spellcaster can use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-undead"><i>create greater undead</i></a> to create a bodak, but only if the spell is cast while the spellcaster is located on one of the evil outer planes (traditionally the Abyss).</p>
<p>Torture victims endure days, weeks, or years of horrible, mind-bending pain and misery. Those lucky (or unlucky) enough to survive these horrors are forever changed.</p>
<p>Yet for some, bearing witness to true horror and supernatural evil does more than twist their mindsâ it ravages their souls to such a degree that they are themselves transformed. Requiring evil far beyond that normally found among mortals, this rare transformation occurs when unprepared mortals venture deep into those extraplanar spaces where humanity was not meant to treadâthe deepest hiding holes of the evil planes. In these repositories of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Unholy" style="font-style: italic">unholy</a> knowledge, things are seen that cannot be unseen, and which indelibly stain the souls of the foolish. The creatures that emerge from these places are mortal no longer. Rather they are bodaksâ misanthropic husks whose very eyes smoke with the horror of all theyâve seen, destined to wander the planes and bring their terrible visions to the living.</p>
<p>The transformation into a bodak is as physically painful as it is spiritually damning. As the images of the horror are replayed over and over in the victimâs mind, his body is wracked with pain, causing him to thrash about in debilitating seizures. The victimâs eyelids clamp shut in a nearly unbreakable bondânothing short of prying or cutting the eyelids apart will force them open. Those who witness this transformation and live to tell of it say that the victimâs eyes seem to migrate about the face, growing and shrinking in size as if trying to escape from the personâs head. Shortly thereafter, the rest of the body undergoes a change as well, with the limbs elongating, hair falling off, and skin drying out on the bones, giving the victim an emaciated, androgynous frame.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours, the conversion is complete and the victim has become a bodak. Only then do its eyes open once more, though now they are blank orbs set deep in cavernous sockets, constantly weeping foul, smoky vapors. The conversion seriously damages the muscles, giving the bodak a slow, shambling gait. The intellect of the victim also dwindles to pure, base instinctsâyet strangely, it does not lose the ability to speak. When a bodak speaks, its words are full of venom, gibberish, and horrific threats and insults, reflecting its extreme anger and desire to fascinate ability its own terrible fate on others. The purifying touch of sunlight also becomes intolerable to the bodak. Even a tiny sliver of sunlight damages and burns the creature, enraging it and forcing it to flee. For this reason, bodaks on the Material Plane only come out at night and must find a secluded place to hide during the day.</p>
<p>The eyes of the bodak serve as a conduit to the horrors that spawned its transformation. The shimmering, milky orbs briefly mesmerize anyone unlucky enough to catch a direct glimpse of them. If a victim lacks the will to break the gaze, he is quickly overwhelmed by its power and dies shortly thereafterâthe transformation into another bodak begins immediately. Survivors of the bodakâs deadly gaze speak of a flood of bizarre memories, flashes and snippets of the event that caused the bodakâs transformation. Although a person lucky enough to resist the gaze is unharmed, these memories of the darkest reaches of the planes may haunt the survivor periodically for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Bodaks are tortured creatures, driven by endless sorrow, terrible longing, and an extreme bitterness and jealousy toward the living. Bodaks lack even the malevolent joy that fiends seem to feel when tormenting and killing mortal creatures. Only by forcing living creatures to gaze into their eyes and perish do they find anything resembling relief, although that too is very short lived, forcing the bodak to find even more victims in an endless cycle. Some bodaks are so overwhelmed by their desire to turn the living into more of their kind that they drag off victims of their deadly gazes to secluded places in order to watch over the transformation and make sure nothing interrupts it. Once the new bodak arises, however, its creator typically loses interest, leaving the spawn on its own. In rare instances, however, bodaks band together in small units called gangs. This does not seem to reflect any true sense of companionship, but is most common when a bodak kills either a former loved one or the person who led it to the point of its original transformationâthe bond between them is now twisted together into hate and loathing, but still unbreakable.</p>
<p>Though inclined to wander the planes when given their freedom, the slow-witted bodaks are rarely seen outside the evil-aligned planes, and especially the Abyss, where powerful demons find them useful minions. On that plane, they often serve as guardians, assassins, or thralls, particularly for nabasu demons or liches (both of which are immune to its gaze). Extremely skilled necromancers are able to use powerful magic, notably <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-undead"><i>create greater undead</i></a>, to create bodaks, but only if the spellcaster is located on one of the evil Outer Planes. Mortal spellcasters who dare to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Summon-Sp-">summon</a> a bodak must protect themselves with other magic to keep its deadly gaze at bay.</p>
<h4><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h4>
<p>Scholars and theologians have long debated the exact nature of these strange <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, positing that itâs the very act that creates a bodakâwitnessing some evil and hideous occurrence beyond all mortal capacity for understandingâthat gives unholy life and purpose to these creatures. In some sense, the bodak is the very manifestation of such an act, a curse upon the living, its life force scarred to such a degree that only causing others to gaze into its eyes and share its agony gives it some sort of relief. Most researchers believe that mundane evil is not enough, arguing that only traumatic deaths in the darkest pits of the planes are pure enough to form a bodak, with the creatureâs animating energy being drawn from the evil Outer Planes where it met its fate. Yet others insist that itâs not the place that causes the transformation, but rather the purity of the evil and horror involved, thus making it possible for an ordinary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> (or, more likely, a summoned demon) to spark the transformation, provided the horrors it shows to the victim are heinous enough. Regardless, such quibbles are academic and unimportant in the face of the dangerous creatures themselves.</p>
<p>Bodaks exist only to find the living and damn their souls to a similar fate. In many ways, bodaks found on the Outer Planes are worse off than those on the Material Plane, if only for the distinct lack of living <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> upon which to fascinate ability their particular method of torment. The longing of Abyssal bodaks is akin to an eternal, insatiable hunger, which is perhaps mirrored in the bodakâs emaciated form, and helps to explain their slowwitted willingness to serve demons who provide them with living fodder from time to time. No bodak has ever been witnessed feasting on the meat of its victims, but some have been seen to enter into a violent frenzy after having killed a living creature with its deadly gaze.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society">Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>When given the opportunity, many bodaks return to the places that once brought them comfort and joy in their mortal lives, following their fragmented memories to destroy their loved ones and acquaintances with their deadly gazes. Astute investigators can sometimes deduce the former identity of a bodak based on the trail of dead and missing persons, especially if the bodak is the spawn of an attack rather than the result of unholy visions. Yet ultimately, a bodak wanders with little control over where it ends up, and those who succumb far from home rarely make it back, simply taking what victims they can find.</p>
<h4><span id="Campaign_Role"><a name="TOC-Campaign-Role"></a>Campaign Role</span></h4>
<p>Bodaks are the physical manifestation of a metaphysical eventâ what happens when a mortal being is exposed to pure supernatural horror. In this way, bodaks are a great way to introduce themes of innocence lost or illustrate for players the price of unbridled curiosity into the dark arts. Bodaks are perfect wandering monsters for adventures that take place on the Outer Planes (especially the evil ones), as well as creatures that evoke both pity and horrorâparticularly if the bodak used to be a friendly NPC.</p>
<p>Bodaks work well as bogeymen, waiting patiently in the shadows until they find lone victims to ambush and transform into others of their kind. If a bodak fails to kill a victim with its gaze, it may still tear him apart with its claws, leaving behind bloody gobbets and few clues as to the true nature of the killer. Adventurers who make it to the Abyss itself may find themselves hunted by bodaks almost immediately, drawn by the presence of living creatures in their infernal realm.</p>
<p>As relatively slow monsters, bodaks are better ambush predators than outright combatants, as most PCs who survive the initial meeting can quickly distance themselves and run for safety. This shortcoming can be mitigated by having the PCs encounter the bodaks in confined areas, or can be played up for greater effect, with the PCs fleeing but knowing that the bodak is still behind them, following slowly, tirelessly, and utterly without mercy.</p>
<h4><span id="Treasure"><a name="TOC-Treasure"></a>Treasure</span></h4>
<p>Bodaks that roam the Abyss never seek out or collect treasure of any kindâvictims are too far and few between to hoard prizes, and the scant few mortals found roaming the plane are killed and transformed without thought to the gear they carry.</p>
<h4><span id="Bodak_Apocalypse"><a name="TOC-Bodak-Apocalypse-"></a>Bodak Apocalypse?</span></h4>
<p>Because of their ability to propagate through their deadly gaze attack, bodaks can spread through an area in a frighteningly short period of time. GMs could set up a scenario where local people speak of people being turned into the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> at an alarming rate, with those attacked by the creatures turning into <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> as well. Most players would immediately presume that the town or area was under assault by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombies</a> or some other relatively weak <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> that spread quickly. This is a perfect setup for fooling the adventurers into thinking that they can walk into the area and easily clean up the mess.</p>
<p>Over time, a village or other lightly populated area may turn into a literal graveyard, as the entire population is transformed into a small army of potent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>. Adventurers that expect to clean out a low-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> infestation will find themselves in for quite a shock upon discovering high-CR bodaks running amok, so bodaks make perfect candidates for bringing the classic âzombie apocalypseâ adventure to higher-level characters. And of course, the original bodak in the town had to come from somewhere, and adventurers may also have to deal with a powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizard</a>, or demon, making the situation even more perilous.</p>
<p>Most bodaks begin as normal humanoids that fall prey to another bodakâs gaze or a scene of mind-bending, incomprehensible planar evil, yet on extremely rare occasions, other creatures may fall prey to these effects as well. The unique natures of these transformations create bodaks with some unusual twists to their forms and abilities. Even among ordinary humans, a few manage to retain enough shreds of their former lives to retain some of their class levels and abilitiesâironically making them even more dangerous to their former allies.</p>
<p><b>Larger Bodaks</b>: A giant that falls prey to a bodakâs deadly gaze retains its larger size, as well as its natural armor bonus if that bonus is larger than the bodakâs normal natural armor bonus. To generate statistics for a giant bodak, adjust its statistics as necessary for its larger size and advance its undead racial Hit Dice to match the total number of humanoid racial Hit Dice the giant possessed while it lived. If the giant had 10 or fewer racial Hit Dice, then no change to the standard bodak (apart from size) is necessary. The bodakâs CR should be adjusted upward to account for its greater size and HDâas a general rule, every 2 HD added should increase the bodakâs CR by +1.</p>
<p><b>Smaller Bodaks</b>: Small humanoids that become bodaks have all the appropriate bonuses and penalties for dropping from Medium to Small size (â4 Str, +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dex</a>, +1 size bonus on attack rolls and to AC, reduced natural attack damage, etc.). A Small bodakâs CR does not changeâit remains a CR 8 monster.</p>
<p><b>Multiple Heads</b>: A bodak created from a creature with multiple heads, such as an ettin, becomes deadlier because it has more eyes with which to project its horrific stare. The save DC against a multi-headed bodakâs death gaze increases by +2.</p>

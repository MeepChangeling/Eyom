<p>Frost mites are miniscule, flying insects that travel in tight groups. As they move, the air around them freezes, disguising the horde of unnatural monsters in a natural fog. The mass of insects seeks out warm bodies to feed upon, eager to slay their victim and convert its body into an icy host. Unlike other insects, frost mites lay their eggs in trees or in small holes in the ground before the spring thaw. The eggs hatch during the fall months and the larvae turn into these flying mites by the first snow of the season. Winterâs peak is when these creatures are in full force. Animals and travelers have been found frozen to death anywhere from wintery forests to cozy barns. Their deaths have been credited to these tiny, wintery pests.</p>
<p>Frost mites infect their victims with a magical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases">disease</a> known as frost scars. Victims of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases">disease</a> suffer intense cold as their flesh continues to freeze and slough off in grotesque ice crystals. Those who survive a frost mite swarm attack and the ensuing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases">disease</a> are commonly marked by horrible deep scars with a blue tint. These scarred survivors are considered lucky compared to those that contract the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases">disease</a> and never recover. Tales of unfortunate villagers growing weak, sluggish and clutching a blanket to stay warm are told to children to keep them away from the depths of forests. These tales are also heeded by adults.</p>

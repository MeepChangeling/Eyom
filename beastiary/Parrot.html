<p>The parrot is a colorful bird native to tropical climes. They range from 1 foot to 3 feet in length.</p>
<p>Parrots are natural mimics, and are famed for their ability to repeat words and short phrases they have been taught. They are seed eaters, and not generally aggressive, but their powerful beaks are fully capable of severing a finger that is poked too close to them. They can manipulate objects using their feet and beaks with enough dexterity to put a key in a lock and turn it if they have been trained to do so.</p>

<p>Parrots can be domesticated and trained, but they have no hunting skills. However, they can be taught to talk and retrieve items.</p>

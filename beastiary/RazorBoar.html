<h1>Razor Boar</h1>
<p class="description">This enormous boar has a black-bristled hide marked by hundreds of old scars. Its eyes are wild and bloodshot, and its tusks are more than three feet long, gleaming like polished ivory and sharper than many swords.</p>

<p> On a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> against a creature of up to one size category larger than itself, the razor boarâs gore attack severs the opponentâs head (if it has one) from its body. Though some creatures, such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golems</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> other than <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/vampire">vampires</a>, are not affected by the loss of their heads, most creatures die when their heads are cut off.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate or warm forests or mountains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A razor boar attacks intruders on its territory without provocation or warning. If attacking more than one target, it tramples one and slashes the other with its tusks and fore-hooves. The creature is swift for its size, and the thickness of its hide allows it to shrug off many lows. Razor boars have been known to recover from seemingly mortal wounds, track down their attackers, and exact revenge.</p>

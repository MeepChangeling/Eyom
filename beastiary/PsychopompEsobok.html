<h4><span id="Eater_of_the_Dead_Su">Eater of the Dead (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Esoboks enjoy eating <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> flesh, and are immune to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> conditions.</p>
<h4><span id="Wrench_Spirit_Su">Wrench Spirit (Su)</span></h4>
<p>If an esobok begins its turn <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> a living or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature, it can attempt to wrench that creatureâs animating spirit free as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. If the target succeeds at a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save, it takes 1d6 points of force damage; if the target fails, its spirit is stripped from its body.</p>
<p>This effect instantly destroys mindless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> that have fewer <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> than the esobok and leaves all other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a>.</p>
<p>All other targets are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a>. Once per round, a creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> by this effect can attempt a new saving throw to free its soul from the esobokâs jaws. An esobok canât use its bite attack while it holds a disembodied spirit, but it can release the spirit as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, at which point the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daze">daze</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis">paralysis</a> effect ends. Creatures without souls (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a>) and creatures whose bodies and souls are one unit (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>) are immune to this ability.

<p>Esoboks are the blunt and vicious predator caste of psychopomps. They patrol as feral hunters, hungry for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> flesh. Though as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> esoboks donât have to eat and draw no sustenance from this behavior, the spark of undeath is a feast for their every sense, and they pursue and ravenously consume <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures given the chance.</p>
<p>Esoboksâ unruly nature and limited intelligence make them ideal border guards and âattack <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>,â although their behavior can be alien and unsettling to those who expect them to display either more animalistic instincts or the sophisticated intellects of other psychopomps. These predators are never trusted to retrieve the souls of the fallen, but they are often called to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> to help contain outbreaks of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>âin such situations, their joy at the taste of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> flesh generally prevents them from attacking living targets, despite their lust for battle.</p>
<p>Some psychopomps (particularly vanths) have developed methods of training esoboks to realize greater potentials, allowing the creatures to tap into newfound reservoirs of magical ability. These trained esoboks have the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/advanced-creature-cr-1">advanced creature</a> simple template and gain access to the following <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, each usable once per day: <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/ear-piercing-scream">ear-piercing scream</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haunting-mists">haunting mists</a>, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">teleport</a>.</p>
<p>The typical esobok stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder, is nearly as wide, and weighs upward of 300 pounds.</p>
<p>While as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> they have no need to eat or drink to survive, esoboksâ gnawing hunger and focused purpose cause them to grow restless, irritated, and unpredictable if denied prey too long. They favor unliving meals, but will hunt anything they can chase. Esoboks prefer rich sources of negative and positive energyâsuch as characters who can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-">channel energy</a>, beings that radiate these energies naturally, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions">potions</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls">scrolls of</a> various cure and inflict spellsâbut most every entity in the multiverse holds some shining seed of energy that an esobok would savor.</p>
<p>Packs of esoboks roam like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/canines/wolf/">wolves</a>, constantly searching for intruders and those who would raise the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> or interfere with their tombs. These feral packs carve out territories and defend them from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> and even other psychopomps. While they prefer the taste of undeath, esoboks eat their fill of infernal or celestial trespassers. Only <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/petitioner-cr-1">petitioners</a> and other psychopomps escape their predation.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/psychopomp/psychopomp-vanth">vanths</a> serve as eerily disciplined soldiers, morrignas hunt fugitives of the system, and other psychopomps tend to the bureaucracy of death, esoboks are her guardian beasts. Uncorrupted by ethical questions or personal desires, they simply shred whatever they encounter.</p>
<p>Their unruly nature and limited intelligence make esoboks ideal border guards and attack <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>. Like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/psychopomp/psychopomp-vanth">vanths</a>, their behavior is alien and unsettling, seemingly devoid of the mortal heritage of most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>. Vanths find the creatures comforting, and frequently recruit them to direct their savage fury against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/astradaemon">astradaemons</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/night-hag">night hags</a>, and others who might profit from interfering with the River of Souls. Only the most disciplined of esoboks are permitted within sight of great palaces of justice and record halls, and even then only when tightly chained.</p>
<p>Esoboks are never trusted to retrieve the souls of the fallen. Despite their fondness for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/petitioner-cr-1">petitioners</a>, they are rough and simple-minded brutes that are difficult to control. Even if allowed to visit the mortal world, they require short leashes and disciplined masters. They most frequently accompany <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/psychopomp/psychopomp-vanth">vanths</a> to sites of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> infection, and more rarely act as muscle for morrignas tired of subtlety. Occasionally, mortal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner">summoners</a> call forth esoboks to contain outbreaks of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>âtheir joy at the taste of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> flesh usually keeps them from causing much harm to other creatures. If they lack <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> prey, however, esoboks stranded on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> prey on whatever they can chase and catch.</p>
<p>Though esoboks respect and fear more powerful psychopomps, only <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/psychopomp/psychopomp-vanth">vanths</a> seem capable of training them into anything more than crude <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>. Such trained esoboks grow substantially in power, as their newfound discipline taps into their latent magic. These war dogs have the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/advanced-creature-cr-1">advanced</a> simple template and gain the following <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, each usable once per day: ear-piercing scream, haunting mists, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">teleport</a>.</p>

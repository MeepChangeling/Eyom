<p>A layer of superheated blood and fat just beneath the steam bearâs thick hide both insulates the great beast from the biting cold of its arctic home, and provides a potent defense against other predators <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Native">native</a> to the tundra.

<p>Steam bears have a strong resemblance to the ordinary animals which inspired their name. The âsteamâ portion of their common name comes not only from their boiling blubber layer, but from the gout of flesh-scalding steam they can blast from an opening just above their snout. Steam bears use this geyser to bring down whales and other great sea-beasts, to battle for reproductive dominance, or for spectacular waterspout displays that seem to serve no real purpose. Some are even clever enough to use this boiling stream to selectively weaken portions of their glacial home to create pit traps for their prey, or carve out simple lairs for their brood.</p>
<p>The breath in the creatureâs mouth and sinuses is superheated by the boiler in its guts: the steam bear poaches flesh as it tears away at it.</p>

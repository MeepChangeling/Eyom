<h4><span id="Constrict_Ex">Constrict (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The double-headed snake can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, when it makes a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage).</p>
<h4><span id="Swallow_Whole_Ex">Swallow Whole (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If the double-headed snake begins its turn with an opponent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> in one of its mouths (see <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">Grab</a>), it can attempt a new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check (as though attempting to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pin</a> the opponent). If it succeeds, it temporarily dislocates its jaw and swallows its prey, up to one size category above or below the double-headed snake. The opponent takes bite damage.</p>
<p>A swallowed creature takes damage each round, 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus 5d6 acid damage, AC 24, 20 hp.</p>
<p>A swallowed creature remains in the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition, while the double-headed snake does not.</p>
<p>A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any slashing or piercing weapon, or it can just try to escape the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the double-headed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake">snake</a> cannot use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-">swallow whole</a> again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>, success puts it back in the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake">snakeâs</a> mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.</p>
<h4><span id="Fast_Swallow_Ex">Fast Swallow (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The creature can use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-">swallow whole</a> ability as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> at any time during its turn, not just at the start of its turn.</p>
<h4><span id="Intimidating_Gaze_Su">Intimidating Gaze (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, the double-headed snake can use both of its heads to instill paralyzing fear in its victims. Requires a DC 28 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> for 2d6 rounds. This effect ends if the victim is attacked by the double-headed snake. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm swamps or jungle<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The double-headed snake resembles a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake/snake-constrictor-anaconda">giant anaconda</a>, but has a fully functioning head at both ends of its body, and a paralyzing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a>. They are revered for their rarity and prowess.</p>
<p>There are many slithering predators hiding in jungles, forests, and swamps, but itâs a luckyâor unluckyâparty that stumbles upon a double-headed snake. As large as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake/snake-constrictor-anaconda">giant anaconda</a>, but with a fearsome head at each end, the double-headed snake is revered and respected for its awesome power. It is incredibly strong, Stealthy, and is capable of taking down and devouring creatures the size of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant">elephants</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/dinosaur">dinosaurs</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants">giants</a>. Their mottled skin gives them exceptional camouflage, and they have a stare that paralyzes their prey.</p>
<p>Double-headed snakes can exceed 60 feet in length and are an exceptional foe to contend with.</p>

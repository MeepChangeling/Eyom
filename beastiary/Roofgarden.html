<h4><span id="Creeping_Cover_Ex">Creeping Cover (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A roofgarden can unfurl a large, dense carpet of cysts, thorns, and vines in a 40-foot radius as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, the roofgarden can disappear from its current location and reappear at any point within this area; this movement does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>. The area within a roofgardenâs creeping cover is treated as if affected by an <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/entangle">entangle</a> spell (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 17). The roofgarden can retract its creeping <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, but while the cover is deployed, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> cannot move beyond its area of effect. While this lush carpet is a part of the roofgardenâs body, attacking the creeping cover deals no damage to the roofgarden.</p>
<h4><span id="Volatile_Pods_Ex">Volatile Pods (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The roofgardenâs fruits store alchemically potent fluids that explode when jostled or struck. The plant can launch 1 or 2 pods up to 50 feet each round as ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> attacks. A pod explodes on contact, inflicting 4d6 points of fire damage in a 10-foot-radius burst. A roofgarden contains a number of pods equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (typically 10), and ejected pods regrow in 24 hours.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forest or urban<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Originally native to forests, where they laze about in the canopy to snare birds and small game, roofgardens are largely sedentary predatory plants whose bodies generate volatile oils that both render them resistant to heat and allow them to start the raging infernos required to cast their seeds into the wind. Vigorous logging efforts in their primordial homeland have spread roofgardens to several cities. Roofgardens have since come to thrive on the broad, unobstructed, elevated surfaces of their namesake, providing the territorial plants with plenty of birds, sunlight, water, and even human victims.</p>
<p>Roofgardens derive their names from the large mass of vines and moss they spread over the area around them to collect sunlight. The plants are gluttons for both warmth and water, and they consequently find most northern environments inhospitable, though the potential exists for them to spread along coasts, driving increased scrutiny of lumber for the tiny seeds it might conceal.</p>

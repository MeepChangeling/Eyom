<h4><span id="Acidic_Su">Acidic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature that touches a warpglass ooze or strikes it with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attack</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a> takes 1d4 points of acid damage unless it succeeds at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save. A creature that strikes a warpglass ooze with a melee weapon must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save, or that weapon takes 1d4 points of acid damage. Ammunition that strikes a warpglass ooze is automatically destroyed after it inflicts its damage. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Buoyant_Ex">Buoyant (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A warpglass ooze can move on the surface of water-based liquids as if using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/water-walk">water walk</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Compelling_Reflection_Su">Compelling Reflection (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A warpglass ooze displays supernaturally captivating images of nearby creatures. A creature within 30 feet of a warpglass ooze must succeed at a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save at the beginning of its turn or be compelled to move toward the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> and take no other actions for 1 round, avoiding any other dangers along its path (including any movement that would provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>). A creature can avoid the need to make the saving throw by not looking at the warpglass ooze, as with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> attack. If an affected creature ends its turn adjacent to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a>, it touches the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> and takes a â1 penalty on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a>– and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based checks from the harrowing images it sees. This penalty stacks, up to a total of â4. The penalty is a curse effect that slowly fades with time, reducing the penalty by 1 every 24 hours until it reaches 0. A creature that successfully saves against this effect canât be affected again by the same warpglass oozeâs compelling reflection for 24 hours. Sightless creatures canât be affected by this ability, nor can creatures that cast no reflection (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire/vampire">vampires</a>).

<p>Warpglass oozes lurk in marshes and forests, masquerading as a simple puddle or stretching across the surface of a larger body of water. Tales say that a traveler can indeed see her future in the reflections of a warpglass ooze… if she can survive the creatureâs enchanting magic and acidic caress. In fact, creatures that look upon these ambush predators do see a warped reflection of themselvesâpossibly dressed as a regal knight, weeping over an open grave, or holding aloft a valuable baubleâthough there is no evidence the images are founded in reality.</p>
<p>Warpglass oozes arenât particularly intelligent, but they are patient, favoring subtlety over brute combat.</p>
<p>The oozes enthrall their prey with fanciful images, compelling their victims to touch its acidic surface so the ooze can break down and digest the victimâs flesh. A warpglass oozeâs images might be whimsical or terrifying, but they always feature the viewing creature reflected in the oozeâs surface. Creatures that shake off the oozeâs compulsion find their minds lingering on the distorted reflections as they attempt to meetâor avoidâthe fate they witnessed. If attacked, warpglass oozes extrude knots of protoplasm to bludgeon foes, but they often retreat in the face of powerful opposition. Warpglass oozes typically donât pursue escaping prey as long as other food sources remain available, but if hungry enough, an ooze may follow a solitary creature.</p>
<p>A typical warpglass ooze is about 4 feet in diameter and a few inches thick, and it weighs about 250 pounds.</p>
<p>Barely sentient, warpglass oozes primarily concern themselves with the basics of survival. A warpglass ooze seeks out a spot where it can hide in plain sight, but with sufficient traffic to keep them sated. Warpglass oozes can subsist on nearly any sort of organic material, but they strongly prefer fresh meat to vegetation or carrion. As their preferred prey are animals and humanoids, both of whom are affected by their compelling reflection, warpglass oozes are usually found in well-used watering holes, ditches alongside well-traveled trails, and ponds near busy settlements. They generally avoid lairs near swift-moving water, as they arenât skilled swimmers and can mimic only still water. Warpglass oozes remain in their selected location as long as food remains plentiful, moving on only if prey becomes scarce or if they are harassed or threatened.</p>
<p>Warpglass oozes reproduce asexually, splitting into two separate oozes after gaining sufficient mass through feeding (an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> preparing to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Split-Ex-">split</a> might have the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/simple-template-giant-cr-1">giant creature</a> simple template). A pool of several warpglass oozes may form in particularly favorable areas where enough food allows them to frequently <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Split-Ex-">split</a>.</p>
<p>Sages disagree on the origins of these strange oozes.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Though warpglass oozes thrive in nearly any environment, they frequently drift toward rural, stony areas where standing water is common. They are not unheard of in urban areas, but they rarely survive long there; larger cities donât provide the time and privacy the oozes need to lure, slay, and digest prey, while smaller villages become alarmed more quickly at missing residents and seek out threats. Warpglass oozes can survive in arctic or desert climates, although they grow sluggish in such conditions. In cold environments, warpglass oozes learn to stiffen their surface to more closely resemble a sheet of ice. Desert denizens are frequently protective of watering holes and suspicious of small, clear puddles, so warpglass oozes often lurk under stony overhangs or amid enticing hot springs.</p>
<p>Warpglass oozes arenât intelligent enough to form true societies, although pools of oozes sometimes work together. These pools often position one or two warpglass oozes to draw in prey, while the others slowly slink around behind their victims to cut off escape.</p>

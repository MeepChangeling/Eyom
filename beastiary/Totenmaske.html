<h4><span id="Charisma_Drain_Su"><a name="TOC-Charisma-Drain-Su-"></a>Charisma Drain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A totenmaske can eat the hopes and dreams of a creature it bites, dealing 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> drain unless the victim makes a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Fleshdrink_Su"><a name="TOC-Fleshdrink-Su-"></a>Fleshdrink (Su)</span></h4>
<p>If a totenmaske hits a single creature with both claw attacks, the hollow claws drain away some of the targetâs flesh, dealing 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> damage and making the victim <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> and reduces the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> condition duration to 1 round. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Shape_Flesh_Su"><a name="TOC-Shape-Flesh-Su-"></a>Shape Flesh (Su)</span></h4>
<p>By spending 1 minute in contact with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> creature, a totenmaske can reshape the targetâs face, causing flesh to cover vital features. The target may attempt a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to resist. Changes are permanent, but can be reversed with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal">heal</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">restoration</a>, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate">regeneration</a>, or by surgically opening the sealed flesh with a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> check that takes 1d3 rounds and deals 1d4 points of damage even if the check is not successful.</p>
<p>A totenmaske can use this ability on one of four different features per use: ears (target becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deaf</a>), eyes (target becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blind</a>), mouth (target cannot speak or eat), or nose (target cannot smell). Multiple uses can have increasingly serious effects (such as sealing the mouth and nose, which causes suffocation). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land or underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Consumed by the same lusts and excesses that led them in life, the souls of some sinners rise as totenmaskes, drinking the flesh and memories of living creatures and even stepping into their lives to once more pursue their base desires. Incapable of resuming their sinful pursuits in their natural form, totenmaskes often keep their victims alive for as long as possible, renewing their stolen identities regularly in order to continue indulging in pleasures of the flesh.</p>
<p>A totenmaske can be created from the corpse of a sinful mortal by a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a> of at least 18th level using the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-undead"><i>create greater undead</i></a> spell. A totenmaske is 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.</p>

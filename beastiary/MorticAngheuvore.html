<p>Angheuvores gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-">scent</a> ability, but only for corpses and badly wounded creatures (creatures with 25% or fewer <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>).</p>
<h4><span id="Flesh_Consumption_Ex">Flesh Consumption (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If an angheuvore consumes at least 1 pound of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> flesh, it gains a number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> equal to double its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> for 24 hours. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> stack with other sources of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>, but not with other uses of this ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Paralytic_Saliva_Su">Paralytic Saliva (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day, as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a> an angheuvore can affect a living creature it bites with paralytic saliva. An affected creature is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. Elves are immune to this effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>The connection between <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elves</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghouls</a> is not clearly understood; <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elves</a> are resistant to ghoulsâ paralyzing touch, but not the disease that transforms humanoids into ghouls. Angheuvore mortics, or âhalf-ghouls,â are lanky, pallid creatures with an insatiable hunger for flesh. They have the long ears and featureless, dark eyes characteristic of elves but have a larger jaw filled with sharp teeth. Born from elven parents afflicted with ghoul fever or otherwise subjected to necromantic energies, angheuvores are often shunned as children due to their appetites. They typically grow up on their own or among degenerate communities of other angheuvores. Never fully satisfied without a belly full of humanoid flesh, angheuvores lurk at the edges of civilization looking for opportunities to sate their appetites. Some angheuvores keep other humanoids as prisoners to feast upon at their leisure, and the victims in these âlardersâ live in constant fear of becoming the next meal. Angheuvores living within humanoid communities often keep a low profile by subsisting on corpses and frequently work as gravediggers, morticians, or physicians.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elves</a>, angheuvores are long lived, often drifting from community to community for centuries. They share an appreciation for art, although angheuvore aesthetics are often unpleasant to other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>, as they predominantly center on the look and smell of blood, flesh, and organs. Unlike <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elves</a>, angheuvores arenât particularly patient and donât take any particular care to live in harmony with their surroundings.</p>
<p>Angheuvores and ghouls get along reasonably well, and they often share hunting territory or even coexist in the same isolated communities. Angheuvores enjoy the elven immunity to the ghoulsâ paralyzing toxin, but angheuvores are as susceptible to ghoul fever as any other humanoid, and can become infected via infighting or even by sharing food. An angheuvore who dies from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghoul</a> fever always putrefies and rises as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul/ghast">ghast</a>. These ghasts retain their memories and any class levels acquired by the angheuvore; the transition from living to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> is not as jarring a step for an angheuvore.</p>
<p>Angheuvores are typically 6 feet tall and weigh about 125 pounds.</p>

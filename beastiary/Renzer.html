<h1>Renzer</h1>
<p class="description">A massive, grayish-white shark-like creature swims forth. Its head is horrifically human-like in appearance, but completely hairless, having neither hair, nor eyebrows, nor lashes. Its teeth are long and pointed and its tongue is forked and brown in color. Its shark-like pectoral fins end in three-fingered claws and it has two dorsal fins, side-by-side. Its tail fins curve sharply and are a bit lighter in color than the rest of its body. </p>

<p>The deadly renzer roams the seas and oceans preying on fish, aquatic plants, and very often – travelers that enter its domain. Thought to be the result of a wizard’s deadly experiment gone awry, the renzer hates most other forms of life and attacks them on sight.</p>
<p>Renzer are a malevolent and vile race and care little for anyone one, including others of their kind. They are solitary, selfish creatures that derive great pleasure from killing other creatures, and so they spend a large amount of time hunting prey; sometimes for food, other times for the thrill of the hunt. Most intelligent races avoid the renzer, but some have actually in recent times opened trade with these creatures. Certain colonies of sahuagin trade goods and services with them, though the deals prove shaky at best. Even the sahuagin don’t really like or trust the renzer.</p>

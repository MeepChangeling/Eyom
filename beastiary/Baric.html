<p>Barics are strange rat-like creatures that hunt in packs. The average baric is 3 feet long and weighs 50 pounds, though they can grow to a length of 7 feet and weigh about 150 pounds. Some races keep barics as pets, though more often than not, these unpredictable monsters turn on their masters within a short time of entering captivity.</p>
<p>Barics hunt in small packs. When prey is encountered, they slowly circle it, moving in to attack with claws and bites. If more than half the pack is slain, the remaining barics usually flee, unless they are very hungry, in which case they all fight to the death.</p>

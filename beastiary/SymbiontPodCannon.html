<h4><span id="Thorn_Blast_Ex">Thorn Blast (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The pod cannon symbiont can fire a blast of sharp thorns as a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> that deals piercing damage. This blast targets all creatures in a 10-ft. cone as per the scatter <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/firearms">firearm</a> quality and fills the 10-ft. cone with thorns that act as caltrops. These thorns rapidly decay, lasting only 2 rounds.</p>
<p>A pod cannon has enough thorns to use this ability 10/day.</p>
<h4><span id="Thorn_Blast_Ex-2">Thorn Blast (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The host may use the pod cannonâs thorn blast ability using the symbiontâs attack modifier or its own, whichever is higher.</p>
<h4><span id="Seed_Pod_Ex">Seed Pod (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day the symbiontâs host can fire a seed cluster from the pod cannon as a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> with a range of 40 ft. On a successful hit the target takes 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage and gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> condition for 1 minute. Entangled creatures must succeed at a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or also be anchored in place if they are adjacent to a solid surface and cannot leave their space.</p>
<p>Flying creatures (not using <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> flight) that fail their save begin to fall immediately and become anchored to the first surface they <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>The pod cannon symbiont attaches its roots to one of the hostâs shoulders, a long stem extending behind the hostâs back toward the other shoulder. The stem gradually expands into a large, roughly cylindrical shape which rests on the hostâs other shoulders, held down by numerous vines wrapping under the hostâs arm and upper arm. The pod cannon symbiont is one of the few symbionts bred to produce reproductive seeds, which form the basis of the sticky material of its pod weapon.</p>
<p>However, the process that bestows the seed clusters with their resinous, alchemical nature also renders them sterile.</p>
<p>When not attached to a host, a pod cannon symbiont takes on a quadrupedal form measuring about 4 1/2 feet long and standing 5 feet high. The length of its body is comprised of the hollow cannon shaft, with a twitching ring of teeth around the muzzle.</p>
<p>The erahthi developed pod cannon symbionts at the height of the Century War, where they were used by soldiers against the enemyâs frontline <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighters</a>. The erahthi used the pod cannons to impede enemy movement while other units fired from a distance or closed in for the kill. Since the war, pod cannon symbionts have seen use among big game hunters, allowing them to stagger their prey from a distance.</p>

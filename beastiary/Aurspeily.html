<p><b>Before Combat</b> Aurspeily hide in the rocks and crags above their prey, waiting for an enemy to walk near a precipice so it can shove them off.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Aurspeily focus their claw attacks on single targets (so as to deal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Rake-Ex-">rake</a> damage) but when an enemy opens themselves to being shoved out of the combat, the creature takes advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Aurspeily are fearless and tenacious, fighting to the death, although when young are present, thereâs a 50% chance the last remaining adult moves to defend them when reduced to 24 hp or less.</p>

<h4>Unstoppable (Ex)</h4>
<p>An aurspeilyâs density makes it incredibly difficult to stop once it has made up its mind to move. It gains a racial +8 bonus on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush">bull rush</a> checks, as well as a +12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> checks to burst through walls or other inanimate objects.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> mountains, any underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or family (2 plus 1-2 young)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Cousin to the smaller <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/aurumvorax">aurumvorax</a>, the aurspeily is a perpetually hungry beast that stalks the mountainsides, seeking ore or preferably living creatures to devour (rarely leaving even a scrap of stone behind once they have set their mind of devouring something).</p>
<p>Their incredible mobility around the mountains only makes them more fearsome. While they are typically unable to leap from one cliff side to another due to their weight, taking to the air is the only way to escape an aurspeily. Fortunately, their size vastly limits the amount these truly omnivoric creatures are able to consume. While they can stay put for weeks or months at a time once theyâve found something they are interested in eating, the metallic felines almost always pursue live prey when it is available, killing their targets and dragging them into an enclosed space to devour them in entirety.</p>
<p>Much like the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/aurumvorax">aurumvorax</a>, aurspeily can quite easily be trained when young. Acquiring one is an exceedingly dangerous task however, for they are jealously watched over by their mothers until the cub is large enough to strike out on its own.</p>
<p>With the amount of stone and metal that is normally part of their diet, aurspeily are incredibly dense creatures, often weighing nearly a thousand hundred pounds despite their size of only four ft. high at the shoulder and 5 ft. long.</p>

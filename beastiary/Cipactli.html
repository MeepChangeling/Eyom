<h4><span id="Devour_Su">Devour (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any time a cipactli kills or destroys a creature with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-">swallow whole</a> ability, it gains a number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> equal to 5 Ã the slain creatureâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Destructive_Ex">Destructive (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A cipactliâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> are treated as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a> for the purpose of damaging objects.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a cipactli can bellow out a terrible, deafening roar. All creatures within 300 feet must succeed at a DC 33 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be permanently <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deafened</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked">panicked</a> for 1d4+4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save against this effect are instead <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1d4+4 rounds. This is a sonic effect; the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked">panicked</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> effects are sonic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> fear effects.

<h4><span id="Hibernation_Ex">Hibernation (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A cipactli can enter a state of hibernation at will as long as it is submerged underwater. Doing so takes 1 minute. While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a>, as if it were in a deep <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep">sleep</a>. It can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes. While in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. If it is damaged while hibernating, it awakens immediately but must succeed at a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to avoid being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1d6 rounds.</p>
<h4><span id="Ravenous_Bite_Ex">Ravenous Bite (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A cipactli adds 1-1/2 times its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> bonus to the damage from its primary bite attack.</p>
<h4><span id="Regeneration_Ex">Regeneration (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A cipactliâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> can be suppressed by damage from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic">mythic</a> sources or by a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> from an effect that deals negative energy damage. Alternately, any amount of negative energy damage dealt to the cipactliâs stomach from a swallowed creature suppresses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a>. A cipactli can regurgitate any number of creatures from its stomach as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Swallow_Whole_Su">Swallow Whole (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature swallowed by a cipactli not only takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage as the creatureâs mouth-lined gullet consumes its body, but also suffers an additional effect depending on the cipactliâs dedicated focus (as listed below) each round. The save DCs for the following abilities are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<p><i>Consume Artistry</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of devouring the creations of mortals damages its victimsâ armor and weapons and any items it swallows.

A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> swallowed by this type of cipactli takes 6d6 points of damage in addition to the 20d6 points of damage normally caused by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-">swallow whole</a> ability.</p>
<p><i>Consume Clarity</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of consuming clarity causes its victims to experience distracting and confusing thoughts while imprisoned in its stomach. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a> for 1d4 rounds. A creature affected by this <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">confusion</a> effect adds 10 to its roll when determining the effects of the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">confusion</a> effect. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect.</p>
<p><i>Consume Grace</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of devouring grace causes its victims to become clumsy and careless. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Dexterity drain</a>. Affected creatures also take a â4 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saves for 1d3 days. This penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saves is a curse effect.</p>
<p><i>Consume Lore</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of devouring lore strips knowledge from its victims. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or take 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Intelligence drain</a>. In addition, each round the creature is swallowed, it forgets up to 30 minutes of its memories as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/modify-memory">modify memory</a>. This experience typically results in erasing the strongest memories first, such as recently considered facts about the victimâs current goals or precious formative memories.</p>
<p><i>Consume Rule</i>: A cipactli created for the purpose of consuming the organizing principle of rule causes its victims to suffer feelings of worthlessness and incompetence. A swallowed creature must succeed at a DC 33 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or take 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Wisdom drain</a> and 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Charisma drain</a>.</p>

This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect.</p>

<h4><span id="Trample_Ex">Trample (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a cipactli deals damage to a foe with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Trample-Ex-">trample</a> special attack, it can immediately attempt to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> the trampled foe with a â20 penalty on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check. If it succeeds at this check, it can immediately swallow the trampled creature whole.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any water<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Ravenous forces of destruction, cipactlis are created by the gods to scour worlds of specific mortal qualities. It is believed that primal and destructive forces of nature spawned the first cipactli, and that it was wrought upon the world as an insatiable agent of annihilation. Stories claim that the gods saw fault in this creation and set a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps/">trap</a> to destroy the first and most powerful cipactli, but such legends suggest that this destruction wasnât complete.</p>
<p>All cipactlis are attuned to certain aspects of their worlds, and when not slumbering in wait, they tear through mortal civilizations in a swath of destructive feasting. Thankfully, these creatures are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Essentially ageless, many a cipactli has been defeated by great heroes, only to have a portion of its body sink below the waters and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate">regenerate</a>. After such a defeat, a cipactli often goes into a state of hibernation that can last for centuries.</p>
<p>Though they are destructive creatures, they have immense knowledge of the world. Those who can calm them may learn secrets about the universe to which most mortals are not normally privy.</p>
<p>A cipactli is 50 feet long and weighs 18,000 pounds.</p>

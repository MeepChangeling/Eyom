<h1>Crayfish, Monstrous</h1>
<p class="description">This creature looks like a giant lobster with a sharp snout and eyes on movable and flickering stalks. Two large claws protrude from its thorax in front of four other pairs of spindly walking legs. Its exoskeleton is dark brown in color.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Water-Dependency-Ex-"></a>Water Dependency (Ex)</h4>
<p>A monstrous crayfish can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>. Beyond this limit, a monstrous crayfish runs the risk of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suffocation">suffocation</a>, as if it were drowning.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> Temperate or warm aquatic<br/> <b>Organization</b> Solitary or colony (2â5)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> None</p>
<p>Giant crayfish are freshwater creatures that dwell on the bottom of seas, lakes, ponds, and other shallow waters. They are predators and scavengers and exist on a diet of decaying flesh (dead fish and other water-based animals), algae, snails, worms, and other animals (including swimmers who come to close to their lair).</p>
<p>Giant crayfish make their homes under rocks or in underwater tunnels burrowed out by the crayfish. Most underwater tunnels extend over long distances and include a âchimneyâ found along the edge of the water or even as far as 100 feet away from the water which allows the giant crayfish to enter and exit its passageways onto dry ground.</p>
<p>Giant crayfish are often hunted as food by dragon turtles, humans, storm giants, and giant turtles.</p>

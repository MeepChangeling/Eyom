<h4><a name="TOC-Daemonic-Pact-Su-"></a>Daemonic Pact (Su)</h4>
<p>Urdefhans are infused with daemonic energy; as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>, an urdefhan can attempt to allow this energy to consume its soul (50% chance of success per attempt). If it succeeds, the urdefhan dies and releases a 5-foot-radius burst of negative energy that deals 2d6 points of damage (DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> half). The save DC is Con-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Strength-Damage-Su-"></a>Strength Damage (Su)</h4>
<p>An urdefhanâs bite drains vitality, turning the skin and muscle around the wound transparent and causing 2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> damage unless the target succeeds on a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. The flesh remains transparent until the Strength damage is healed, but this does not have any other effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>

<p>Infused with fell energies, urdefhans are an unsightly race dedicated to war. They have developed many strange weapons, but none are more iconic than the two-bladed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/rhoka">rhoka sword</a>. Rhoka swords are exotic one-handed melee weaponsâall urdefhans are proficient in their use. With such weapons, an urdefhan seeks to inflict as much death as possible upon the world before it perishes, so that its daemonic lords are pleased. Most male urdefhans are sterileâas a result, the women often turn to conjured daemons for mates. The products of such unions are usually typical urdefhans, but sometimes result in half-fiend urdefhansâthese monsters usually rise to positions of great power in their violent society.</p>

<p class="source"><b>Source</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/160125752X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=160125752X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&amp;linkId=AKZJFVX4SEMW6HO3" target="_blank">PCS:ISMC</a></p>
<p>Travellers most often encounter urdefhans in patrols seeking slaves and foodâthese terms are synonymous to urdefhans. Surface dwellers might also come across a group of a few urdefhan merchants en route to one of the prominent underground hubs to trade for supplies, but these merchants are always accompanied by a squad of 8â10 guards, who seize every opportunity to gather more flesh. Hunting patrols usually consist of four to eight soldiers. If the terrain allows, one to three <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul/skaveling">skaveling</a> riders and their mounts accompany the soldiers.</p>
<p>In and around their fortresses, which are built from scavenged materials or usurped from previous inhabitants, urdefhans appear in smaller groups of two to three soldiers while <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul/skaveling">skaveling</a> riders patrol the air in pairs. They are often bolstered by nearby reinforcements, especially if the fortress hosts a powerful half-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Daemon">daemon</a>.</p>
<p>Urdefhans are much more furtive aboveground, keeping to shadows not because they fear the light (though they shy away from fire), but because the darkness maximizes their victims’ fear.</p>
<p>Urdefhans are vicious combatants who surround their enemies and deliver jagged, painful wounds that kill victims slowly with their signature dual-bladed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/rhoka">rhoka</a> swords. Even when faced with tougher opponents, urdefhans use their savagery to their advantage in hopes that the terrible, bloody death of a strong foe will demoralize its weaker allies. Unless the urdefhans are looking for slaves, they don’t wait for their defeated victims to die before they begin feasting. Urdefhan spellcasters use magic to cause as much pain, fear, and destruction as possible; whether they do this with directly offensive spells or by calling up <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> or otherworldly minions is simply a matter of ghoulish taste.</p>

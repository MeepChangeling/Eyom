<p> Oil-covered hairs at the bottom its feet allows a skate spider to glide across the surface of still or slow-moving water. It can move on water at its normal land speed but will sink if it moves less than half of its normal movement in a turn. Fast moving water is treated like difficult terrain for the skate spider. A skate spider cannot swim and can drown if it becomes submerged in water. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or family (2-10)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p> A skate spider is capable of hunting on land or water. Tiny hairs and secreted oils on the bottom of its feet allow this spider to skate along the surface of lakes, ponds and moving streams without incident. Stopping, however, causes it to sink. If it successfully attacks a creature while on the water, the skate spider has to grab its prey with its fangs or else the meal sinks. </p>
<p> A skate spider is dark brown in coloring. It possesses a faint odor of decay, from the bits of its last meal mingling among the hairs that keep it afloat. They feed on creatures that come near river banks and lake shores. The giant skate spider is 15 ft. long and 500 pounds. Larger and smaller varieties of skate spiders exist. </p>

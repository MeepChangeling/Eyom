<h4><span id="Absorb_Essence_Ex">Absorb Essence (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever a creature that has been <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrified</a> is destroyed within 60 feet of a euryale, the euryale gains the effects of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/cure-serious-wounds">cure serious wounds</a> spell and a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">restoration</a> spell (both at CL 20th).</p>
<h4><span id="Gaze_Su">Gaze (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The euryaleâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> attack has a range of 30 feet and turns the target to stone permanently (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> DC 32 negates). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Irresistible_Poison_Ex">Irresistible Poison (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A creature must roll twice and take the lower result on all saving throws against a euryaleâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> effects. If the creature would normally be immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> doesnât apply, but it only needs to roll its save once. <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/delay-poison">Delay poison</a> doesnât <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Delay">delay</a> her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> effects; they still occur immediately. A euryale gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a> cast against her to negate her venomous attacks.</p>
<h4><span id="Poison_Ex">Poison (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Snake bite, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake/snake-viper">viper</a> fangs, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake/snake-viper">viper</a> rodâinjury; <em>save</em> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 32; <em>frequency</em> 1/round for 6 rounds; <em>effect</em> 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dex</a> damage, 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> damage, and vulnerable to sonic for 1 minute; <em>cure</em> 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Profane_Visions_Ex">Profane Visions (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A euryaleâs prophetic visions allow her to avoid misfortune. She gains a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class">Armor Class</a> equal to her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> bonus, and whenever she would be forced to reroll a d20 or to roll a d20 twice and take the lower result, she takes the higher result of the two rolls instead.</p>
<h4><span id="Shattering_Shriek_Su">Shattering Shriek (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever a euryale uses one of her sonic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, any sonic damage dealt by the spell increases by 1 point per die. In addition, sonic damage from her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> bypasses the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrified</a> creature, and the damage is not halved when applied to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrified</a> creatures. (A typical Medium <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrified</a> creature has 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>.) A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrified</a> creature that is destroyed by the effects of a euryaleâs shattering shriek explodes into a 20-foot burst of jagged stone shards, dealing 4d6 points of slashing damage to any creatures in that area (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 30 half); this explosion heals the euryale as detailed in absorb essence above. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Snake_Independence_Ex">Snake Independence (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A euryaleâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake">snakes</a> are independently intelligent and can attack even when she doesnât. No matter what action the euryale takes, she can still always make all six <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake">snake</a> bite attacks on her turn. Even when she doesnât attack with any other weapons that round, her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake">snake</a> bites always count as secondary attacks.</p>
<h4><span id="Spells">Spells</span></h4>
<p>A euryale casts spells as an 18th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle">oracle</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Statue_Control_Su">Statue Control (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A euryale can control the statues of any creatures she petrifies via her spells or special abilities as long as they remain within 120 feet of her. Petrified creatures are treated as animated stone objects. While the typical Medium <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/animated-object">animated object</a> is almost insignificant in a CR 20 encounter, the euryale often commands these statues to move so as to provide her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> or to place them in areas where she can <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shatter">shatter</a> them to deal the most damage to foes (see the shattering shriek ability). The euryaleâs control over these statues is a purely mental act that takes no action.</p>
<p>A euryale can control a number of statues at once equal to her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier (10 for the typical euryale).</p>
<h4><span id="Viper_Rod_Su">Viper Rod (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any blunt weapon or object a euryale holds becomes a rod of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake/snake-viper">viper</a> with a +5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement bonus</a> that uses her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> instead of its usual <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. She can flick the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake">snake</a> head of her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake/snake-viper">viper</a> rod to fire poisoned fangs as a ranged attack. Treat these attacks as if she fired arrows from a +5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longbow">longbow</a>; fangs launched in this manner deliver her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, triumvirate (3), or cult (1 plus 4â17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/medusa">medusas</a>)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Euryales are powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/medusa">medusa</a> matriarchs.</p>
<p>These rare heretical euryales have alignments other than chaotic evil as well as additional powers gained through their struggle to control their own destinies. Typically they advance by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>, although itâs also fairly common for them to take up to 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle">oracle</a> levels to improve their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle">oracle</a> spellcasting and to represent the curse the Mother of Monsters inflicted upon them for daring to cross her.</p>
<p>A euryale is 7 feet tall and weighs 460 pounds.</p>

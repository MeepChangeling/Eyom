<p>Sand stalkers are agile, 12-foot-long, aggressive, hunting spiders with voracious appetites. Thankfully they are found only in deserts and usually away from civilized areas. The sand stalker is a wanderer; though some do occasionally build lairs. These consist of an open hole constructed in areas where the ground is hard enough to prevent a flood of sand and debris from filling the lair. Some sand stalkers cover their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>s with a “trapdoor” (noticeable with a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check). If the ground is unsuitable for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing, the stalker takes up residence in whatever shelter is available, such as an abandoned temple or beneath a rocky outcropping.</p>
<p>Sand stalkers are typically solitary creatures though on some occasions a few of the creatures nest together. A typical nest consists of 1d4+1 sand stalkers, usually two males, and two females with the female sand stalkers being the dominate forces in the nest.</p>
<p>Sand stalkers are carnivores and hunt all manner of desert-dwelling or desert-traveling creatures. Aggressive predators, they prefer to use stealth to attack by surprise. They <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> just beneath the surface of the sand, leaving their front forelegs exposed where the wind catches them and plays an eerie flute-like sound. They use this deception to attract prey. Creatures that are affected by the hypnotic sound are attacked as soon as they come close. If hungry or threatened, a sand stalker uses its superior speed to run down its prey.</p>

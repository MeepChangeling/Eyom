<p>Hela is a fairly poor combatant, preferring to use her raw power, mastery of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> and arcane might rather than actual combat training or tactics. She is extremely knowledgeable about the structure of the multiverse and nature of reality and souls, funeral rites and the various afterlives.</p>

<h4><span id="Cowards_Bane_Ex">Cowardâs Bane (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Helaâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> are both overcome by epic weapons with the <em>coward-spurning magical property</em> (see below).</p>
<p>Attacks from creatures with theÂ <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter#TOC-Bravery-Ex-">bravery</a>Â class feature at +5 or who are immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> overcome Helaâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-">DR</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> as if they were made with <em>coward-spurning</em> weapons.</p>
<h4><span id="Cowards_Insanity_Ex">Cowardâs Insanity (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature that attempts to interact directly with Helaâs thoughts (such as via <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-">telepathy</a>) must succeed at a DC 55 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be driven permanently insane. This duplicates either the effect of the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/insanity">insanity</a> spell, or as described in the standard insanity rules, in which case the save DC is also the ongoing insanity DC.Â Additionally, any creature driven insane by Helaâs presence permanently loses any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter#TOC-Bravery-Ex-">bravery</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> they possess. This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> remains until the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/insanity">insanity</a> is cured. Helaâs insane victims are cowardly and deeply traumatized, often unable to engage in combat.</p>
<h4><span id="Cry_of_the_Grave_Su">Cry of the Grave (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Anytime Hela uses her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>, she automatically summons up to two <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> of her choice, of up to CR 21, who appear in any square affected by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>.</p>
<p>These summoned <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> appear after the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> occurs, so they are neither harmed nor healed by the positive energy. Once she uses this ability again, existing summoned <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> vanished and are replaced by newly summoned creatures.</p>
<p>Any creature slain by this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> arises as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> roughly equal to the slain creature and under Helaâs control within 1d6 rounds. Hela may choose which <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> are created from each slain creature.</p>
<h4><span id="Queen_of_Undeath_Sp">Queen of Undeath (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>Hela is a goddess of death and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>. She may call and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-undead">create undead</a> servants with an ease, and in numbers impossible for mortal necromancers.</p>
<p>As a full-round action, Hela may use either <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead">animate dead</a> or call of the dead. She may always choose to create burning or bleeding <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeletons</a> with call of the dead without increasing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Casting-Time">casting time</a> Each time she uses call of the dead, all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeletons</a> previously created by this spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disintegrate">disintegrate</a>. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> created by any prior casting of call of the dead legion also <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disintegrate">disintegrate</a> when Hela casts that spell again.</p>
<p>It only requires one minute for Hela to use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-undead">create undead</a>, and only a single hour for her to use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-undead#TOC-Create-Greater-Undead">create greater undead</a>.Â In addition to the normal options provided by the spell, she may create any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> desired up to CR 25 in this manner.Â There is no limit to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> worth of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">Undead</a> Hela can command at any given time.</p>
<p>Finally, when she uses her <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/trap-the-soul">trap the soul</a> ability, Hela uses one of the millions of corpse-nails she wears as the spellâs focus rather than a gemstone.</p>
<h4><span id="Spirit_Touch_Ex">Spirit Touch (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Helaâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a>, as well as any weapon she wields, are treated as though they had the <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ghost-touch">ghost touch</a> weapon special ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Spirit_Sense_Su">Spirit Sense (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Hela notices, locates, and can distinguish between living and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures within 60 feet, just as if she had the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> ability. This sense does not allow her to detect objects, but it does allow her to notice living things that are not creatures (such as normal trees).</p>
<h4><span id="Unspeakable_Presence_Su">Unspeakable Presence (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Helaâs mere presence inflicts horrible mental anguish and torment upon all creatures within 300 ft. who can clearly see and hear Hela. All affected creatures drop to their knees and present their necks, as if for a headmanâs axe, chanting incoherent, suicidal gibberish and becoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> while in the presence of any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature for as long as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> remains in view and for 1d3 hours after. Affected creatures are always considered willing to accept spells and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> cast upon them by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, even if such effects would be harmful or even fatal.</p>
<p>A successful DC 55 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save negates this effect.</p>
<p>A creature who saves cannot be affected by Helaâs unspeakable presence for 24 hours; this is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Extraplanar">extraplanar</a> (the realm of Hel or other corpse-planes)<br/><b>Organization</b> Hela commands an army of dead warriors, murderers and monstrosities from every species that has ever died.<br/><b>Treasure</b> at least triple standard (in lair)</p>
<p>Hela is the primordial model for Undead-kind, a cruel and capricious goddess of death, entropy and undeath. She claims she is the first being to ever come to consciousness: she waited all alone in the darkness of the unborn Multiverse waiting for another intelligence to be born, so she could murder it. She talks knowledgeably about the end of time, when all matter and energy collapses in on itself and everything ends. The only reason Hela has not expunged all life in the multiverse at once is that she enjoys the game of reaping souls in (relative) handfuls at a time. Further, she knows it will all be hers in the end, so Hela, while grasping, is not greedy.</p>
<p>Hela rules an endless corpse-plane named for herself. This endless, nearly lightless expanse is a hellscape of cold rains and endless fog, peopled by the infinite souls of the dead. Hela claims evil and sadistic souls, but also cowards, those who died after long illness or by suicide and the dim, animal-like souls of the stillborn. She has no interest in claiming the good or noble souls, nor the souls of true warriors â these glowing souls would be beacons of hope in a drab realm she wishes to keep hopeless.</p>
<p>Hela appears as well-built, physically powerful and eerily perfect woman with corpse-white skin. She would be considered beautiful, if not for the madness in her black eyes, her fanged smile, and the unnerving, herky-jerky wrongness of her movements. She dresses only in ravensâ feathers and the fingernails of dead women, which her strange powers have formed into a clacking, clicking robe.</p>
<p>She is lusty and vile, raping the souls of hanged men until the ghosts become so irreversibly mad all traces of humanity are lost. She laughs, snarls, barks and moans in orgasm as she fights, relishing any wounds her opponents manage to actually inflict. If truly wounded, especially by a coward-spurning weapon, she stops enjoying the fight long enough to utterly destroy her attacker, before returning to her violent revels.</p>
<p>Hela is also a skilled crafter who specializes in necromantic artifacts of great, morbid beauty.</p>
<p>Helaâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> can be defeated by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/mythic#TOC-Mythic">mythic</a> weapons with this magical property, which is reprinted here from other sourcebooks.</p>
<p>Coward Spurning Weapon Property</p>
<p>This weapon is especially accurate and lethal when wielded by a courageous warrior, but obstinately refuses to land a solid blow in the hand of a coward.</p>
<p>If wielded by a character with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter#TOC-Bravery-Ex-">bravery</a> class feature or one who is immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a>, the wielder may add their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter#TOC-Bravery-Ex-">bravery</a> to the damage inflicted with the weapon. (Thus a wielder with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter#TOC-Bravery-Ex-">bravery</a> +3 would inflict 3 extra points of damage with a Coward-Spurning weapon.) This stacks with the weaponâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement bonus</a>, and this additional damage is not multiplied on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">Immunity</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fear-Su-or-Sp-">fear</a> is considered to function as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter#TOC-Bravery-Ex-">bravery</a> +5 for the purpose of wielding this weapon.</p>
<p>However, if the wielder succumbs to any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect, retreats in combat, or otherwise acts in a cowardly manner, for 24 hours, all coward-spurning weapons become more difficult to wield. During this time, the benefit of this property does not apply, and the wielder suffers a penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a> with any coward-spurning weapon equal to either -3 or their negative <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter#TOC-Bravery-Ex-">bravery</a>, whichever is greater.Â This effect can be removed by gaining the benefit of either a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/good-hope">good hope</a> spell, an <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/atonement">atonement</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse">remove curse</a> effect.</p>

<p>The terrifying riptide horror is a giant, sightless tubeworm found in sea caves or deep within desolate marshes. They are carnivorous creatures and have a voracious appetite that is only sated with meat, preferably that of warm-blooded humanoids or reptiles.</p>
<p>Opportunistic, ambush hunters, riptide horrors wait for prey to come to them. They can go several weeks without eating, and sometimes do, but if a meal is readily available, the horror does not hesitate to kill and devour it. Such a meal is placed in a “reserve” stomach-like sac. When the food supply is low, the riptide horror delves into its reserve and draws sustenance from the stored food.</p>
<p>Riptide horrors mate once a year, usually in flooded sea caves. The female crawls into the male’s lair and deposits a sticky, greenish-tan mass of eggs on the wall of the cave. The male fertilizes the eggs and in 4 months, the eggs begin to hatch. Juveniles are excellent swimmers and leave the cave as soon as they hatch. As a riptide horror ages, its body secretes a substance that forms a shell-like carapace on its dorsal side.</p>

<p>Velvet ants are not really ants at all but a form of wasp. The females are wingless while the males have wings. Velvet ants have a bright red abdomen and thorax and a black head and black legs. Its thorax and abdomen are covered with short, coarse, red hairs. Typical adults reach a length of 1 inch.</p>
<p>Velvet ants feed on the nectar of flowers, though on some occasions, the adults have been known to feed on other wasps and bees, particularly bumblebees or honey bees. Other such insects are generally left alone.</p>
<p>Velvet ants typically make their lair in bee hives or nests they have taken over. Generally an assault is short and quick, with the velvet ants swarming the bees and quickly gaining the upper hand, slaying all bees in a single nest. Slain bees are kept as food for the velvet ant larvae.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Drowning-Touch-Su-"></a>Drowning Touch (Su)</h4>
<p> Creatures that take damage from the riverswell spiritâs chilling touch begin to have their lungs fill with water from the spiritâs drowning touch. If the creature is not already making <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> checks to keep from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Drowning">drowning</a>, the creature must succeed a DC 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> check. If the creature made a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> check in the previous round to keep from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Drowning">drowning</a> (either from following the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Drowning">drowning</a> rules or from previous drowning touch attacks), increase the DC by 1. This DC is in addition to the standard DC increase gained every round from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Drowning">drowning</a> rules and is cumulative with each successive drowning touch attack. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> checks continue until the creature takes a full round action to spit up all the water accumulating in their lungs and breathes air, receives a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> check from another creature as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> to force the water out of their lungs, is the target of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse"><i>remove curse</i></a> or similar spell, sustains any amount of fire damage, or fails the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> check. Creatures that fail the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> check begin to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Drowning">drown</a> as per the normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Drowning">drowning</a> rules. Creatures that do not need to breathe or can breathe water ignore drowning touch. </p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Haunt-Su-"></a>Haunt (Su)</h4>
<p> A riverswell spirit cannot be killed by destroying the spirit. Instead the physical body to which the riverswell spirit is tied must be destroyed or blessed. If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> of the spirit are reduced to 0, it rises again the following time the river floods and hunts for a new victim. A riverswell spirit cannot travel more than 400 ft. from its physical body. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any inland aquatic<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or gang (3-6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p> A riverswell spirit is the drowned victim of a flood or violent downpour. Its spirit haunts the banks near its bloated, decomposing body, seeking out others to meet its watery fate. While this vile creature can appear at anytime, it frequently appears when a riverâs banks rise and flood the surrounding landscape. Apart from drowning living creatures, this undead horror appears to have no goals or motives. Communication has not been successful with the restless spirit but sages (those that have survived an encounter) believe that it is possible. A riverswell spirit would stands between five and six feet high if it ever walked on its feet. Whether through the water or air, it flies wherever it goes. </p>

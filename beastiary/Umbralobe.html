<p>Any creature with at least 10 HD who is slain by the umbralobeâs bloating rot poison rises in 1d4 rounds as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mohrg">mohrg</a> under the umbralobeâs command. These rotting, ravenous corpses are never allowed into the inner sanctum of the umbralobeâs lair, and form an outer, protective perimeter around the creatureâs habitat. These semi-controlled <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mohrg">mohrgs</a> farther deplete the countryside around the lair, and add to the umbralobeâs dark legend.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a particularly clever <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mohrg">mohrg</a> is allowed into the lair as a personal servant, but this is fairly rare.</p>
<h4><span id="Murderous_Hatred_of_the_Light_Ex">Murderous Hatred of the Light (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An umbralobe despises the light, and those who wield it. The umbralobe receives a +5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus">morale bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> against any spellcaster who casts a spell with the light or fire descriptors within the umbralobeâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares">threatened</a> squares. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">Concentration</a> checks made while casting a spell with these descriptors suffer a -5 penalty.</p>
<h4><span id="Poisoned_Web_Ex">Poisoned Web (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>This ability functions identically to the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/web">web</a> ability, but it affects all creatures in a 10 ft. radius burst. In addition, any creature hit by the web must save against the umbralobeâs bloating rot poison.</p>
<h4><span id="Profane_Umbra_Su">Profane Umbra (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An umbralobe receives a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class">Armor Class</a> and saving throws equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier (+3).</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> ruins, underground and cold mountains<br/><b>Organization</b> always solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> double standard (in lair)</p>
<p>An umbralobe is not a spider, though it wears an arachnid form. It is a hateful, obsidian bolus of darkness, greed and envy given form and consciousness.</p>
<p>Umbralobes keep to the worldâs dark places, preferring remote caverns and mountain lairs, far from the hated light of the sun. Umbralobes exist solely to feed, and the species has no community nor sense of common purpose. Umbralobes make their lairs a continent away from their nearest rivals â at minimum â because the creatures know if they encounter another of their own kind, murder is the only option.</p>
<p>Umbralobes hold grandiose and horrific dreams of eating the stars themselves, of murdering all things in the multiverse until they are alone in the darkness of pure entropy. Despite their boasts, and their murderous fantasies, umbralobes are too small an evil to extinguish the stars. The spider-like outsiders are phenomenally lazy, in a torpor for months at a time. Once an umbralobe establishes a lair, it hunts the surrounding area to extinction, allowing a dark legend to grow up around it. The utortures and devours any creature who comes into its lair, and does not actually lead, nor inspire the evil beings that often come to worship it as a living god of darkness.</p>
<p>However, if it can convince some unfortunate hominids living nearby to sacrifice to it, the lazy creature welcomes the easy meat.</p>

<h4><span id="Awfulness_Ex">Awfulness (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An unrisenâs form is horrifically distorted. Any creature that sees an unrisen within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p>Once a creature is subjected to an unrisenâs awfulness aura, it is immune to that unrisenâs awfulness aura for 24 hours. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Essential_Salts_Ex">Essential Salts (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An unrisen destroyed by fire damage, disintegration, or as a result of its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection">resurrection</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> is reduced to a handful of metallic blue-green salts. Reducing an unrisen to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> while the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> is in the area of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/consecrate">consecrate</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hallow">hallow</a> effect also reduces the creature to its essential salts. These salts can be used as a material component for the casting of spells that restore life (such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead">raise dead</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection">resurrection</a>, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-resurrection">true resurrection</a>), reducing the total cost of that spellâs material <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a> by 1,500 gp per handful of salts.</p>
<h4><span id="Meant_to_Live_Su">Meant to Live (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An unrisen takes no damage from positive energy. Whenever a positive energy effect would otherwise deal damage to an unrisen, the unrisen heals half that amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> instead.</p>
<h4><span id="Resurrection_Vulnerability_Su">Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead">raise dead</a> or similar spell cast on an unrisen destroys it (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.</p>
<h4><span id="Rise_Again_Su">Rise Again (Su)</span></h4>
<p>One round after an unrisen is destroyed (unless it was reduced to its essential saltsâsee above), it returns to unlife at half its maximum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> (26 hp for most unrisen), reforming in the square in which it was destroyed. Any creature that witnesses an unrisen rising again must succeed at a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round; this is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect. An unrisen can rise again no more often than once per hour; if killed a second time within this hour it is permanently destroyed (note that this does not reduce it to its essential salts). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blasphemy">blasphemy</a> (3â14)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Even by the standards of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, unrisen are an affront to life. An unrisen is rarely created intentionally, as most come about when a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection">resurrection</a> attempt is poorly performed and results in a mishap, or through experimental alchemical processes that attempt to restore life to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a>.</p>
<p>The unrisen cling to unlife with unparalleled resilience.</p>
<p>Their half-living organs drink in positive energy, taking a form of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> from the life-giving power. Even devastating violence cannot truly slay an unrisen, as the magic that created them reforms them over and over in a horrifying rebirth. Only the purifying touch of fire or the unrisenâs dissolution to essential salts can grant these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures permanent rest.</p>
<p>An unrisen is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.</p>

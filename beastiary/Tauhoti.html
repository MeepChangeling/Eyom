<h4>Excellent Memory (Ex)</h4>
<p>A tauhotiâs brain readily catalogues information that it can recall much later, granting it a +4 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> checks to remember factsâ typically the location of caches or identities of other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>. A tauhoti also gains a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on saving throws against effects that would damage, drain, or reduce its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> ability scores.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests or hills<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or emporium (3â8)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Tauhotis are ground squirrels famed for their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>-like proclivity for trading with other animals.</p>
<p>Tauhotis avidly cache food across a wide territory during warmer seasons so they have ample food to eat during the winter. Though tauhotis share their plentiful larders with other animals in distress, this is no gift. A tauhoti can remember the scent and appearance of hundreds of animals, and it recalls which ones have taken or given it food. The following season, the tauhoti watches for its debtors, at first chirping at them and then nipping them until they provide some repayment. Some birds and mammals maintain mutual relationships with tauhotis, bringing them offerings of hard-to-access food either in exchange for something else the tauhoti has or to gain the rodentâs assistance in burying a morsel for later. Itâs a common belief that anyone who can maintain a tauhoti as a pet is trustworthy, for the rodents practically never forget a slight and eagerly reward upstanding companions. Selective breeding has produced an albino variety that especially appeals to Kalistocrat owners.</p>
<p>A spellcaster can select a tauhoti as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-">familiar</a>. As a special ability the master gains a +3 bonus on one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession">Profession</a> check of her choice, selected when gaining the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/familiar">familiar</a>.</p>

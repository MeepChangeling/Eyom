<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a shadow fern can expel a cloud of poisonous spores in a 10-foot-radius burst that lingers for 1 minute before dispersing. A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gust-of-wind">gust of wind</a> spell, disperses the cloud in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round. A new shadow fern grows out of the corpse of any creature that dies as a result of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> from this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> after 1 week.</p>
<h4><span id="Vulnerable_to_Light_Ex">Vulnerable to Light (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Shadow ferns use darkness for essential life functions in the same way normal plants use sunlight for photosynthesis. Their fast healing is suppressed in areas of normal light and bright light, and they are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> in areas of bright light.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any forests or underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or patch (3-12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Shadow ferns grow in large patches throughout dark-dwelling societies-including caligni, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a>, and especially <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-duergar">duergar</a>-cultivate the plants underground, since they thrive in the lightless depths. Over the millennia, the plants have even spread into the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Shadow-Plane">Plane of Shadow</a>, leading travelers using shadow walk to encounter the plants with increasing frequency during their umbral jaunts. Some shadowcasters believe that elder specimens of shadow ferns are capable of existing simultaneously on both the Material and Shadow Planes, and many such casters have a number of potted shadow ferns in their laboratories for further study. Malevolent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druids</a> have been known to weaponize shadow fern spores, killing their victims and seeding new patches of the invasive plant in their victims’ corpses.</p>

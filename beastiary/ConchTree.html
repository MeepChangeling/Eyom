<h4>Collapse (Ex)</h4>
<p>Once a conch tree swallows a creature whole, it can collapse into a smaller hard shell to protect itself while it digests its prey. The tree curls around its prey, reinforcing its own outer flesh and changing colors to represent mud or stone. Its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a> to AC increases to +20 and it gains a +20 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks on ocean floor terrains. Against creatures trapped inside the conch tree, the tree gains a +8 bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> and to the bludgeoning damage it deals with its stomach. A swallowed creature must succeed on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> in order to cut their way out. A swallowed creature takes half the damage dealt to the collapsed conch tree by weapons and spells.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any ocean<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or grove (4-30)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Conch trees are frequently cultivated as living barriers, unsporting hedges against unwanted incursions. After centuries of breeding and experimentation, they developed an instinct for discerning regular travelers among their groves from visiting prey. In the wild, entire schools of fish can vanish instantly over a conch grove.</p>
<p>Conch trees reproduce by implanting a single seed in a partially digested corpse. The corpse is then expelled so the seed can absorb nutrients before sprouting and taking root.</p>
<p>Conch trees never stop growing, but an average adult specimen is 20 feet tall.</p>

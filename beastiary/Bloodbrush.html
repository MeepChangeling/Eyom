<h4><a name="TOC-Barbs-Ex-"></a>Barbs (Ex)</h4>
<p>A creature that strikes a bloodbrush with a melee weapon, an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a>, or a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapon</a> takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage, and is exposed to the bloodbrush’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. Any creature that attempts a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> check against a bloodbrush also takes this barb damage, regardless of success. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger an attacker in this way. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> creature takes barb damage at the start of the bloodbrush’s turn.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Flammable-Ex-"></a>Flammable (Ex)</h4>
<p>If a bloodbrush takes fire damage, it catches fire, but does not take damage for catching fire in the round it ignites. It takes 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of each turn unless it succeeds at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save to extinguish the flame. A burning bloodbrush inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage with its barbs and slam attacks and to any creature that strikes it with a melee attack as its barbs ability.</p>

<p>Though they resemble humble tumbleweed, bloodbrushes are animate and aggressive. Movement draws its attention, especially when accompanied by warmth and moisture. When it strikes prey, it latches on and delivers a sedating toxin through its barbs. Victims that succumb to this poison experience vivid hallucinations as the bloodbrush finishes them off. As much a drug as a poison, refined bloodbrush toxin commands a high price in the right circles. A single bloodbrush provides sufficient <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> to refine 1d4 doses of bloodbrush extract, and counts as the raw materials for the process. </p>
<p>Bloodbrush thorns deposit seeds, though the seeds germinate only in dead flesh. A single corpse sprouts 2d4 seedlings. After 3 months of growth, the now-mature and animate bloodbrush breaks free of its roots and rolls off in search of prey. Prior to this, an immature bloodbrush is neither animate nor toxic. A bloodbrush lives for up to 6 months after tearing free, and can survive 2 weeks between feedings. Despite its size, a mature bloodbrush plant weighs 5 pounds at most.</p>
<p>Harvesting the thorns and preparing the tea requires a successful DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> check. Drinking this tea grants a +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on saves against an ongoing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Particularly ingenious tribes cultivate bloodbrush in the shallowly buried corpses of their fallen enemies. When a farmed bloodbrush is near maturity, the grower places a sturdy wicker cage about it to prevent it from escaping.</p>
<p>Such cages can be completely sealed and carried into battle or covertly placed in a rival settlement. When released, the captive bloodbrush tends to attack the nearest target, so using one as a weapon presents significant risks to the one who releases it.</p>

<h1>Kampfult</h1>

Six smaller tendrils located at the base of its trunk seem to aid it in locomotion. Its body is dark grayish-green and its tendrils are dark gray changing to dark green at the tips.</p>

<p>The kampfult is a tree-like creature that haunts subterranean realms in search of prey, grabbing any living creature that passes by. Creatures slain by a kampfult are slowly absorbed into the base of the trunk and digested.</p>
<p>A kampfult stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 600 pounds.</p>
<p>A kampfult attacks from surprise, waiting until its prey moves within reach and then lashing out with its tendrils, attempting to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a> and entangle its prey. A kampfult rarely attacks creatures larger than itself unless it is extremely hungry. It fights until either it or its opponent is dead.</p>

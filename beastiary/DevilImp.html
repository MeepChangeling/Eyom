<h4><span id="Poison_Ex">Poison (Ex)</span></h4>
<p><b>Sting</b>âinjury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p>
<h4><span id="Familiar_Service">Familiar Service</span></h4>
<p>Willingly serving spellcasters as familiars, imps play the role of dutiful servants, often granting their masters cunning advice and infernal insights. In truth, though, an imp works to deliver souls to Hell, assuring that its master’s soulâand as many collateral souls as possibleâfaces damnation upon death.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Hell)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or flock (3â10)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Born directly from the pits of Hell, imps are among the least of the true devils; these vicious, manipulative fiends, however, hold an important role in the corruption of mortal souls. Unfettered from the ranks and duties of diabolical armies, imps delight in any opportunity to travel to the Material Plane and subtly tempt mortals toward acts of ever-greater depravity.</p>
<p>Imps vary widely in appearance, ranging through a spectrum of bestial traits and grotesque body shapes, though most take the forms of red-skinned, winged humanoids with bulbous features. Such a typical imp stands a mere 2 feet tall, has a 3-foot wingspan, and weighs 10 pounds.</p>
<p>Unlike most devils, imps often find themselves free and alone on the Material Plane, particularly after they’ve been summoned to serve as familiars and their masters have perished (often indirectly due to the machinations of the imp itself). With no way to return home, these imps, freed of their bonds to arcane masters, can become dangerous pests or even leaders of small tribes of savage humanoids like goblins or kobolds.</p>
<h3><span id="Infernal_Sacrifice">Infernal Sacrifice</span></h3>
<p>As a placation to their tiny egos, imps favor small, bloody sacrifices that suggest their summoner’s willingness to do evil. Those who offer a heart cut from the breast of a still-living dove gain a +2 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> checks made to summon an imp.</p>
<h3><span id="Variants">Variants</span></h3>
<p><b>Imp Consular</b> One in every thousand imps possesses the ability to communicate telepathically with creatures within 50 feet and the power to change its form into that of any Small or Tiny animal, as per the spell <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape" rel="nofollow">beast shape II</a></i>. These imp consulars are highly prized by powerful devils, who send them to serve their favored minions or to corrupt mortals with great destinies.</p>

<h4><span id="Cactus_Sap">Cactus Sap</span></h4>
<p>When a cactus cat imbibes the sap of a cactus, it produces an extremely intoxicating substance called âcactus Sapâ or âcatsapâ. A single drop of this potent liquid is enough to inebriate an average human. The Cactus Sap can be harvested from the cactus cat with no damage to the latter once the cat is successfully <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a>. A cactus cat contains 1d4 vials of Cactus Sap at any given time.</p>
<h4><span id="Intimidating_Yowl">Intimidating Yowl</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, the cactus cat can emit a terrifying yowl 4 times per encounter that strikes fear into the hearts of its opponents. Victims that fail the DC 16 intimidate check are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1d4 rounds. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> player is considered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate and hot plains<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or pack (known as a cacophony) (3-12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> catsap</p>
<p>The cactus cat is actually a mobile cactus which resembles a feline roughly the size of a bobcat with a spiky coat and a branched tail.</p>
<p>Cactus cats photosynthesize like all plants, but they also obtain nutrients by using their razor sharp claws to cut into local cacti and drink the sap. They will return to the cactus many times as the sap ferments and when they overindulge, enjoy a drunken caterwaul long into the night. Upon occasion, cats from multiple territories will congregate when drunk and conduct a group yowl.</p>
<p>The catsap a cactus cat produces after drinking from normal cacti is very potent and the resulting hangover is entirely resistant to magical cures. While it does not harm the cat to harvest the catsap, they will likely resist the process of extracting it.</p>
<p>In late summer, the cats will produce a flower on the head or neck, which can give them the appearance of wearing a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Hat">hat</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Jewelry">jewelry</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="Components">Components</span></h3>
<p>The flowers of a cactus cat can be ground up and added to any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions" style="font-style: italic;">potion</a>, increasing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> of the spell by +1. The sap can be added to any potion increasing the effective level by +3. However, ingesting the sap causes the person to become immediately inebriated for 1 hour. After which, they will be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for another 2 hours as the hangover sets in.</p>

<p>A skitter rat can determine the health aura of all living creatures it can see within 30 feet. This tells it if creatures are at full health or injured, and whether it possesses any of the following conditionsâ<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Disabled">disabled</a>, diseased, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked">panicked</a>, poisoned, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a>.</p>

<p>Up to two skitter rats can share the same space at the same time. If two skitter rats in the same space attack the same foe, they are considered to be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking">flanking</a> that foe.</p>
<p>This creature resembles a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/rat/rat-common">rat</a> the size of a small dog. Its tail is furred, and all four of its paws look nimble and dexterous.</p>
<p>Skitter rats are scavenging rodents with a dim intelligence and psychic senses. They can determine the presence of living creatures and whether or not they are injuredâthe better to set up ambushes to finish them off. Skitter rat warrens are often found near the lairs of larger, more dangerous monsters. The skitter rats feed on scraps the monster leaves behind, or waits until it gets into a fight in order to finish off the victor of these clashes.They do not carry disease as many other monstrous rats do, but their teeth inflict bleeding wounds that can drain the life out of their victims.</p>
<p>Skitter rats can telepathically communicate with each other, but these are limited mostly to images and emotions. Their warrens are organized like the hive of a social <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/bees-and-wasps/wasp">wasp</a>âonly one female reproduces and the other adults help her, but they are kept in line through bullying and violence rather than being inherently sterile. When the warren gets too large and food becomes scarce, older females leave with a cohort of males to set up warrens of their own. They are almost always found underground, but these scouting expeditions may surface at night to find an appropriate lair. Some skitter rats make their residence in crumbling buildings or sewersâthese may be mistaken for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/rat/dire-rat">dire rats</a>, but are much more dangerous.</p>
<p>Skitter rat fur is prized among subterranean humanoids, although the sapience of skitter rats makes this resource mostly exploited by evil humanoids. For their part, skitter rats are more likely to tend towards evil than goodâthey live by a rule of might makes right, and may be recruited by demon cults or other lovers of the violent and monstrous. Skitter rats have a peculiar preference for the flesh of halflings. Halfling communities invoke skitter rats as bogeymen to keep their children in line.</p>

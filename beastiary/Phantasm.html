<p>Phantasms are malevolent and sinister spirits that delight in the destruction of good-aligned creatures. While many <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures are the undead form of once living creatures, phantasms have no real material connection to living creatures; they are spirits born of pure evil. They are most often found haunting ruined temples or churches dedicated to evil gods, or dungeons constructed by evil creatures; any place where the stench of evil permeates the very air.</p>
<p>Phantasms are sometimes employed by other, more powerful undead, such as liches or vampires, though for the most part they are solitary creatures (though sometimes they are encountered with other phantasms). Phantasm gangs, while rare, work together to bring about the destruction of their foes, using their abilities to destroy and corrupt as many opponents as they can.</p>
<p>Phantasms appear as translucent humanoid-shaped creatures with faintly discernible facial features resembling a human face twisted and corrupted by evil. Hair, if present, is formed of the immaterial stuff the phantasm is composed of. Their arms are long and thin and end in wisps of the very stuff they are made of. Likewise, their lower torso trails off into the same misty substance.</p>
<p>A phantasm is a dangerous foe because of its ability to possess and control a living creature. It begins battle by attempting to possess a foe, and if successful, it then controls the host like a puppet. In addition, while possessing a foe, it is constantly sapping its life energy. When the host is destroyed, the phantasm leaves the body and attempts to repeat the process with any aggressors still around.</p>

<h4><span id="Spellcasting">Spellcasting</span></h4>
<p>An icegaunt casts spells as a 5th level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid</a>. It does not gain the other class abilities of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid</a>, such as domains or an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions">animal companion</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> has deeply wrinkled, leathery skin and hollow, sunken eyes. They are clad in furs and other heavy clothing.</p>
<p>The sacrifice of sentient beings is a common religious practice, and in icy lands, such sacrifices are often conducted via exposure. A humanoid slain in this manner may rise as an icegaunt, sometimes called a frost mummy. Such creatures look almost as they did in life, as they are freeze-dried, but their lack of visible breath or shivering can give them away to the observant. Perhaps as a compensation for their ritualized deaths, the crueler powers of nature have granted them druidic powers.</p>
<p>Icegaunts are xenophobic and territorial, patrolling the area where they died and lashing out at intruders. Sometimes this is done with mere physical violence, but more patient icegaunts may disguise themselves as guides or explorers. These may pretend to befriend travelers, only to lure them into an avalanche, crevasse or simply a thin spot in the ice. Their touch drains both heat and life, and those they kill with their bare hands are as freeze-dried as they are. Most icegaunts keep a stout stick as a backup weapon, as adventurers all too often have spells to resist the cold.</p>
<p>Icegaunts sometimes form from humanoids of other sizes. An icegaunt formed from a halfling, goblin or other Small humanoid is treated as having the young simple template. Those formed from ogres or giants are treated as having the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/simple-template-giant-cr-1/">giant simple template</a>. Icegaunts that advance do so with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid</a> levelsâthey never take the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/domains#TOC-Fire-Domain">Fire domain</a> or fire spells, and only rarely will an icegaunt <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid</a> choose an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions">animal companion</a>.</p>

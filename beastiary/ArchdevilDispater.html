<h4><span id="Caustic_Wit_Su">Caustic Wit (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Dispater is a master of urbane insults and flippant dismissals. He can attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff">Bluff</a> check once per round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> in place of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate">Intimidate</a> check to demoralize a foe within 30 feet. In addition to becoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a>, a creature demoralized by Dispater is so filled with shame and self-loathing that it takes 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> and becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a>. This additional effect can be negated with a successful DC 37 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. The insulted creature can attempt a new save each round at the beginning of its turn as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> to end the effect, but any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> sustained remains until it is healed. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Lord_of_Iron_Ex">Lord of Iron (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Rust effects (such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/rusting-grasp">rusting grasp</a>) do not function within 60 feet of Dispater unless he allows them to function. Dispater can command unintelligent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/cobra-constructs/iron-cobra">iron cobras</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem/golem-iron">iron golems</a>, and any other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> made entirely out of iron as if he were the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructâs</a> creator.</p>
<h4><span id="Mortal_Gaze_Su">Mortal Gaze (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Dispater can level his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> upon any one creature within 60 feet as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> once per round. The creature he gazes upon gains 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a>. Each of these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> requires a successful DC 37 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to remove after 24 hours or it becomes permanent. Creatures slain by Dispaterâs mortal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> rise again 1d4 rounds later as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombie</a> lords under Dispaterâs control.

<p>Creatures do not gain the usual +5 bonus on saves against <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-monster">charm monster</a> if they are currently being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares">threatened</a> or attacked by Dispater or his allies.

<p>Dispater is one of Asmodeusâs oldest and most loyal allies, with a favored place in the hierarchy of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>. He generally keeps his distance from the machinations of the other archdevils, and of all their number he cares least about the tedious and trivial affairs of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. His focus is on building the eternal and glorious perfection of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>, the model community and system upon which the universe should be modeled. He is calm, creative, careful, and deliberate, in some ways the picture of a just sovereign, yet he is also unforgiving, ruthless, manipulative, and arrogant in the extreme. The rules of rank, station, and courtly life are his meat and drink, and he is swift to deride any who violate the tiniest rule of etiquette, though he quickly discards decorum when necessary to further his elaborate schemes. Alone among the archdevils, he maintains a passing acquaintance with courtly love and marriage, conferring with his advisors on matters of state.</p>
<p>Dispater is every inch the image of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil">devil</a>, 13 feet tall with rippling, rust-colored muscles and a refined and majestic style, eschewing the opulent grandiosity of some of his brethren.</p>

It allows the wielder to command allegiance as per a rod of rulership with an unlimited duration when activated in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>, it remains limited to 500 total minutes of this effect, but does not crumble to dust if these minutes are used up. Every hour it spends in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a> restores 1 minute of expended duration. When used as a weapon, The Eclipsing Eye has a critical multiplier of Ã3. The Eclipsing Eye automatically casts blindness (as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blindness-deafness">blindness/deafness</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/heighten-spell-metamagic">heightened</a> to 9th level, save DC 23) on the first creature it strikes each round.</p>

<p>Asmodeus can will the destruction of The Eclipsing Eye as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, but otherwise it can be destroyed only by immersing it in the headwaters of the River Styx for a century, allowing the artifact to rust away.</p>
<h3 class="header"><span id="Dispaters_Cult">Dispaterâs Cult</span></h3>
<p>Dispater represents devotion to calming order, meticulous planning, and the dark majesty of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hellâs</a> potential to bring peace and unity to the universe, despite the fact that such peace would be bought with blood, chains, and death. His sacred places are grandiose, typically found in palaces or grand monuments.</p>

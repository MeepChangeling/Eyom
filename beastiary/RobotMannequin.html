<h4><a name="TOC-False-Flesh-Ex-"></a>False Flesh (Ex)</h4>
<p>The synthetic flesh and hair of a mannequin robot give it a +8 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> checks to appear <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> (but not to impersonate a specific <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a>). Closely inspecting a mannequin or touching its cold, synthetic skin automatically reveals its non-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> nature.</p>
<h3>Variants</h3>
<p>Other models of mannequin robot resemble the base model shown at left, but have different capabilities. If no CR change is noted, the model has the same CR as a standard mannequin.</p>
<p>Specialized mannequins advance by taking class levels, generally in non-spellcasting classes such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighter</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger">gunslinger</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monk</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a>.</p>
<p><b>Athlete (CR +1)</b>: Designed to compete in robotic sporting events, an athlete model has +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>, +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/fleet">Fleet</a> in place of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/alertness">Alertness</a>, and a +5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks.</p>
<p><b>Pleasure (CR +1)</b>: Designed for entertainment and leisure purposes, a pleasure model has a +4 bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>, has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/skill-focus">Skill Focus</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform">Perform</a> [any]) in place of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/alertness">Alertness</a>, and can scan the minds of creatures within 30 feet (as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a>).</p>
<p><b>Rescue</b>: Designed for rescue and retrieval operations in conditions too dangerous for unprotected <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>, a rescue model’s resistance to electricity and fire improves to 10.</p>
<p><b>Security (CR +1)</b>: Designed for assisting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> security forces in dangerous situations, a security model has +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-initiative-combat">Improved Initiative</a> in place of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/alertness">Alertness</a>, +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 5. Security models are proficient with firearms, simple weapons, and light armor.</p>
<p><b>Target</b>: Designed as an active target for weapons practice, a target model has +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>, a 10-foot increase to speed, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 5, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/dodge-combat">Dodge</a> in place of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/alertness">Alertness</a>. Reducing a target model below half its maximum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> causes it to shut down for 10 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or band (3â8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Designed to labor at tedious or hazardous tasks, mannequin robots were intended to both look and behave like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>. Their designers felt that <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a> would find the mannequins more comfortable to work next to than conventional robotsâbut they were mistaken. While the mannequins superficially resembled their makers, their inhuman behavior, subtly wrong appearance, and unnatural movement, as well as the unyielding cold of their synthetic flesh proved disturbing, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a> they were meant to work alongside reflexively distrusted them. Though many were produced for a variety of tasks, the mannequin line of robot was deemed a failure. The next generation of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a>-form <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> took the form of a true artificial life form: the android.</p>
<p>Mannequins look more or less <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a>, but their jerky, mechanical movement, imperfectly simulated behavior, and artificial construction give them away with any close interaction. Mannequin robots vary in size and shape as much as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>, but weigh at least 200 pounds because of their metallic endoskeletons.</p>

<h1>Umbral Shepherd</h1>
<p class="description">This mass of shadow possesses a horrific demon face. Several writhing tentacles sprout from its grublike body.</p>

<h4><span id="Planebound_Ex"><a name="TOC-Planebound-Ex-"></a>Planebound (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An umbral shepherd is inherently tied to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Shadow-Plane">Plane of Shadow</a>, and can’t survive for long on any other plane without a host body. Each round that an umbral shepherd is on another plane without a host body, it takes 1d6 points of damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Possession_Su"><a name="TOC-Possession-Su-"></a>Possession (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An umbral shepherd can possess a host body as if using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-jar">magic jar</a>, save that if its host body is killed while possessed, the shepherd dies as well. An umbral shepherd can attempt a possession anytime it succeeds at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, even while already in a host body. If the touched creature fails a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save, it becomes possessed. Possession by an umbral shepherd takes a toll on its host body, which takes 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Constitution drain</a> every month it is so possessed. Abandoning a host body requires the umbral shepherd to either take a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> (to appear in a square adjacent to the host) or make a successful possession attempt on a new host. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Shadow_Touch_Su"><a name="TOC-Shadow-Touch-Su-"></a>Shadow Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An umbral shepherd that succeeds at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> can attempt to dissolve a portion of the victim’s flesh into <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/shadow">shadow</a>, which then dissipates, dealing 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>. Victims that succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save take half damage. The umbral shepherd can use this ability even while possessing a host body. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Shadow-Plane">Plane of Shadow</a>)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or choir (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Umbral shepherds are parasitic entities which relish the chance to infest host bodies to further the work of their dark master. Those infested by such creatures are identifiable primarily by their pure-black eyes and fervor, as well as the slow decay of their bodies. Umbral shepherds also serve as specialized torturers, with their ability to create bloodless cavities and tunnels through a prisoner’s body with a touch of their horrible, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing tentacles.</p>
<p>In their natural state, umbral shepherds are shaped like limbless, demon-faced humans made of coherent shadow, and are capable of spawning any number of tentacles of varying sizes. Some religious scholars believe that the first may have been attempts by evil clerics to change themselves into something closer to the shepherds, yet this remains the unsubstantiated speculation of outsiders. </p>

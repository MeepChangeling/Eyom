<p class="description">This snake-bodied dragon has a sinuous tail with a spiked tip. Flared wings attach to its forelimbs, and it lacks rear legs.</p>

<h4><span id="Impale_Ex"><a name="TOC-Impale-Ex-"></a>Impale (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If an amphiptere confirms a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> with its tail attack against a creature smaller than itself, the spike-tipped tail impales the target creature.</p>
<p>An impaled creature gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> condition (though the amphiptere doesn’t gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition), takes 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage, and automatically takes damage from the amphiptere’s tail each round it remains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a>. An amphiptere can’t <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a> a creature it has impaled, nor can it use its tail attack while it is impaling a creature, but it doesn’t need to succeed at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check to maintain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>. An amphiptere can release an impaled creature as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Limited_Flight_Ex"><a name="TOC-Limited-Flight-Ex-"></a>Limited Flight (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Though amphipteres have wings, they can’t truly fly. Amphipteres usually move by lifting themselves a few feet off the ground with their great batlike wings and pulling themselves along the ground with their claws. This tactic provides an amphiptere a fly speed of 60 feet and average maneuverability, though they can’t lift themselves higher than 10 feet off the ground and can’t use their wings to hover. Additionally, amphipteres can attempt a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly">Fly</a> check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if under the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/feather-fall">feather fall</a>. When falling safely, an amphiptere can attempt an additional DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly">Fly</a> check to glide, allowing it to move 5 feet laterally for every 10 feet it falls.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate or warm deserts, hills, or mountains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or flight (3â18)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Distantly related to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/wyvern">wyverns</a>, amphipteres are equally cruel and prone to violence. Like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/wyvern">wyverns</a>, they have serpentine bodies and bat-like wings. Unlike <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/wyvern">wyverns</a>, however, amphipteres must use the long claws on the tips of their wings to propel their bodies along as they awkwardly leap and soar a few feet off the ground. They’re also longer and much leaner than <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/wyvern">wyverns</a>, and instead of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/wyvern">wyvern’s</a> poisonous stinger, an amphiptere has a broad, arrow-shaped spur at the end of its long tail. Capable of piercing armor and shattering bone, an amphiptere’s tail skewers prey much like a fisher might spear a fish.</p>
<p>Amphipteres average 18 feet in length, though most of this length is the tail, and they weigh around 1,600 pounds.</p>

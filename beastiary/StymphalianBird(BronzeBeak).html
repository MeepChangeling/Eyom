<h1>Stymphalian Bird (Bronze Beak)</h1>

<p>Stymphalian birds are crane-like predators found in dense forests and lowland hills. They are voracious creatures that sustain themselves on a diet of livestock, cattle, and the like. A stymphalian bird has an ibis-like body. Unlike an ibis, however, the stymphalian birdâ€™s beak is long and straight rather than curved. Its feathers, talons, and beak are made of bronze.</p>
<p>A typical stymphalian bird stands 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds.</p>

<h1>Hoar Spirit</h1>
<p class="description">This being is a gaunt humanoid dressed in tattered rags. Its skin is pale gray and ice crystals have formed on various parts of its body. Its hands end in claws, each with translucent icy blue nails. Its eyes are frozen solid and show no signs of life.</p>

<h4><span id="Heatsense_Ex"><a name="TOC-Heatsense-Ex-"></a>Heatsense (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Hoar spirits can detect heat (such as that generated by living creatures) within 60 feet, including the heat of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> creatures. It functions as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsense</a> in regards to any non-visible heat sources within its range.</p>

<p>Believed to be the spirits of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid" target="_blank">humanoids</a> that freeze to death either because of their own mistakes or because of some ritualistic exile into the icy wastes by their culture, hoar spirits haunt the icy wastelands of the world seeking warm-blooded living creatures in which to share their icy hell.</p>
<p>Hoar spirits are rarely encountered alone. Though they act independently and never communicate, something draws these creatures to each other. Perhaps some semblances of their former lives or maybe like-minded creatures that share the same fate are drawn together. Sages have speculated this for ages.</p>
<p>Hoar spirits do not speak, and it is not known if they even understand any language at all. They have a distinctive low-pitched moan that sounds like a whistling wind blowing through ice and snow covered trees.</p>
<p>When confronted, a hoar spirit attacks with its claws attempting to freeze its foe. If facing multiple opponents, a hoar spirit blasts them with its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/cone-of-cold" target="_blank">cone of cold</a> before engaging them with its claws. Creatures killed by a hoar spirit are dragged to its icy lair, kept on ice, and devoured at the monsterâs leisure.</p>

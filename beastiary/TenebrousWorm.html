<h1>Tenebrous Worm</h1>
<p class="description">This pallid beast clatters upon dozens of small legs. Writhing bristles twitch on its back, and its shadow seems strangely mobile.</p>

<h4>Acid (Su)</h4>
<p>The acid of a tenebrous wormâs bite affects only organic matterâas it dissolves creatures, it converts their flesh to shadow that swiftly fades away, leaving raw, jagged wounds behind. In dim light, acid damage dealt by a tenebrous wormâs bite increases to 8d6 points of damage, while in darkness or bright light, the acid damage is reduced to 4d6.</p>
<h4>Bristles (Su)</h4>
<p>Long bristles of shadowstuff extend from between the tenebrous wormâs armor plates. These bristles react swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any creature that attempts to harm the worm. Each time a creature attacks a tenebrous worm, it must make a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save to avoid being punctured by several bristles. Each time a creature is punctured by these bristles, it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the tenebrous wormâs poison. A creature that grapples a tenebrous worm is automatically hurt by these bristles. The save DC to avoid the bristles is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>

<p>The caterpillar-like tenebrous worm is a voracious predator that hungers for mortal flesh. The tenebrous worm is the larval stage of the gloomwingâbut in a strange reversal, these younger creatures are more dangerous than the Adults they grow into. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/Creature-types-2#TOC-Native">native</a> of the Plane of Shadow, a tenebrous worm hatches from the body of an unfortunate creature that has been implanted with an egg by a gloomwing. The tenebrous worm is fully grown upon hatching, and immediately begins to scour its environs for flesh to consume.</p>
<p>Although the tenebrous worm tends to be relatively pale-colored, its internal organs seethe and roil with shadowy energies and dark fluids. As the creature feeds, these shadowy innards begin to grow out of its body, forming strange bristle-like filaments of semisolid shadowstuff not only capable of piercing the flesh of those who would attack the worm, but also possessing a deadly paralytic poison. Additional shadowy fluids constantly seep from the wormâs mandiblesâwhen it bites prey, these fluids melt flesh into shadows that the creature can then consume. When a tenebrous worm feeds on enough of this shadowy flesh, the creature seeks out a secluded, shady area (typically just within a cave entrance or in a ruined building) and spins a shadowy cocoon around itself. A tenebrous wormâs cocoon exudes the effects of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness"><i>darkness</i></a> spell (CL 8th), muting the surrounding light. After a period of several days, the cocoon tears open and a fully grown gloomwing emerges, ready to seek a host for its eggs.</p>

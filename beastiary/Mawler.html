<p>Sages are uncertain as to the origin of the mawler, but speculation ranges from it being related to the mimic to it being somehow related to the executioner’s hood. Whatever its origins, it is considered by many to be the bane of treasure-seekers everywhere.</p>
<p>A mawler’s natural form is that of a small blob of fleshy stuff approximately 2 feet across. Mawlers are rarely ever seen in their natural form, however, as they almost always take the shape of an article of clothing made for a Medium <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> – meals are easy to come by in that form. A mawler can alter its texture, color, and shape to match such substances as leather and metal. A single mawler usually takes on the form of a single article of clothing, such as a hat, helmet, scarf, codpiece, or belt. A pair of these creatures encountered together can take the shape of a pair of boots or a pair of gloves.</p>
<p>A mawler radiates an aura of magic, and unwitting victims are often lured into believing that they have found a pair of magic boots or magic gloves – when in reality what they place on their legs or hands will soon grow reveal its true nature – much to the detriment of the would-be treasure hunter.</p>
<p>A mawler generally does not engage in melee. It lies in wait for an unsuspecting meal to don it. In the rare instance that a mawler is forced into melee, it attacks with its bite.</p>
<p>When an unsuspecting person dons the mimic, it usually waits 1d3 minutes before attacking with its bite. A mawler that scores a critical and severs a victim’s limb tries to move away as quickly as possible to digest the meal.</p>

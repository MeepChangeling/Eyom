<p>Digers are semi-transparent oozes about 9 feet in diameter that live in abandoned ruins or underground areas where they spend most of their time hunting for food. A digerâs gem-like eye offers it a means to lure its prey in so it can attack. A character can attempt a DC 15 Perception check to realize the gem is not real, but is in fact a part of the creature itself. Anyone with ranks in Appraise or Craft (gemcutting) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice.</p>
<p>A diger attacks by hitting a foe with its slimy appendage, or by simply waiting, floating unnoticed until an opponent contacts it. Often, a diger lies at the bottom of a pool or stream where it is almost impossible to detect (+10 on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> DC). Its gem-like eye appears to be a gemstone or jewel embedded in the ground under the water. An opponent that moves to grab the gemstone is immediately attacked by the diger.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Share-Defenses-Su-"></a><b>Share Defenses (Su)</b></h4>
<p>As a free action, a shantak can extend its no breath ability and cold <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to a single creature touching it. It can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Withdraw">withdraw</a> this protection as a free action.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Slippery-Ex-"></a><b>Slippery (Ex)</b></h4>
<p>A shantakâs scales seep slippery slime. This grants the creature a +8 bonus on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> checks and to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> against grapples, and imparts a â5 penalty on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride">Ride</a> checks made by creatures attempting to ride a shantak.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Starflight-Su-"></a><b>Starflight (Su)</b></h4>
<p>A shantak can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GMâs discretion)âprovided the shantak knows the way to its destination. Shantaks speak in a shrill voice that sounds like glass grinding against stone. They are intelligent creatures and cannot be trained as mountsâa would-be shantak rider must use diplomacy or magic to secure a shantakâs cooperation as a mount, and even then, shantaks have a tendency to deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold mountains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or flock (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Many shantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain creatures, such as the faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain remote mountains, or specific types of harpies or gargoyles in more civilized regions. A shantak avoids confrontations with these types of creatures if possible.</p>
<p>A shantakâs ability to travel the gulfs of space ensures that these scaly, bird-like creatures can be found on numerous worlds. Yet despite this unique ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the gulfs of space.</p>

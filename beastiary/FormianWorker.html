<p>Workers are able to bear remarkable burdens for their size. They have a +5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> when calculating the effects of encumbrance.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm or temperate land or underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, work crew (6â12 plus 1 taskmaster), band (3â15 plus 5â8 warriors and 1 taskmaster).<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental (occasionally a 10â50 gp gem embedded into a worker’s carapace)</p>
<p>These lowest-caste formians stand a little taller than a large dog, and their small mandibles are better equipped for slicing leaves and cutting fruit from the vine than carving into flesh. Regardless, many <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> find the sight of these centaurlike ant creatures intimidating. Their iridescent chitin is nearly featureless, marked only by small scarring as they age and a series of markings on their chest. A few more accomplished formian workers bear small gems proudly glued to their carapace, tokens granted them by taskmasters for particularly impressive accomplishments.</p>
<p>Formian workers are the backbone of the hive. They produce and harvest all food, perform all mining and tunneling, aid the taskmasters in the crafting of goods, and perform all other menial labor. Formian workers grow fast and learn quickly within the hive mind. Shortly after it leaves its larval stage, a formian is assigned to a senior worker who teaches it a trade, and by the end of the second year, a formian worker is a productive member of the hive. Workers live 20â30 years, and older workers are assigned lighter or more skilled work in order to give them capacity to train the young formian workers.</p>

<p>Livestone is a strange species of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> that can solidify itself into a consistency that very closely resembles that of stone. In its solidified form, a livestone is indistinguishable from a normal boulder or slab of rock. No one is quite sure from where livestones originated, but ancient legends say that the dwarves accidentally unleashed these horrors on the surface world by digging into their subterranean lairs. Eventually, some livestones found their way to the surface. Livestones are incredibly longlived, solidifying and entering a form of hibernation and remaining that way indefinitely until a food source wanders too near. Livestones have a simple chameleon-like ability to mimic local stone by ingesting a small sample and adjusting its own color and texture to match. A hibernating livestone can become covered in moss and lichens to further the deception.</p>
<p>Livestones generally attack from ambush, waiting for a potential meal to pass before flowing into their ooze form and rushing up to engulf the prey. If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Surprise">surprise</a> attack fails, a livestone resorts to hammering with a pseudopod. When attacking in this manner, a livestone will solidify the tip of the pseudopod and strike with a hammer-like blow. A livestone’s usual tactic is to solidify the half of its body facing the prey and then send hard-tipped pseudopods out from behind this shield (see solidify above).</p>

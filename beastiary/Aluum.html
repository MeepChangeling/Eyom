<h4><a name="TOC-Immunity-to-Magic-Ex-"></a>Immunity to Magic (Ex)</h4>
<p>An aluum is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature. A magical attack that uses negative energy (such as channel negative energy, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/inflict-light-wounds">inflict light wounds</a>, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/enervation">enervation</a>) deals no damage, but speeds up the aluumâs attacks and movement as if it were under the effects of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> spell for 1d6 rounds. A magical attack that uses positive energy slows the aluum as if by a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> spell for 1d6 rounds and dispels any <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> effects currently affecting it. Magic jar confuses the creature for 1d6 rounds.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Paralysis-Su-"></a>Paralysis (Su)</h4>
<p>The touch of an aluum paralyzes living creatures that fail a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Soul-Shriek-Su-"></a>Soul Shriek (Su)</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> every 1d4 rounds, the aluumâs enslaved souls may emit a keening wail in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 10d6 points of sonic damage and are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round. A DC 15 Will save halves the damage and negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stun</a> effect. This is a sonic mind affecting effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or squad (3â4)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>Aluums are magical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> created from metal and stone. They are the fighting juggernauts that maintain order within the city when the cityâs normal means of doing so fail. Aluums are powered by the souls of slaves and prisoners bound into glowing gems in their chests.</p>
<p>An aluum stands approximately 14 feet tall and weighs over 2 tons. They are controlled by magical pendants called charms of aluum control.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Charm-of-Aluum-Control"></a>Charm of Aluum Control</h4>
<p><b>Aura</b> moderate <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Transmutation">transmutation</a>; CL 20th; <b>Slot</b> neck; <b>Price</b> 20,000 gp; <b>Weight</b> â</p>
<p>This pendant holds a glowing crystal etched with faint runes. Created to manipulate and control <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> known as aluums, these charms are much sought after on the black market.</p>
<p>Unauthorized possession of a charm of aluum control is considered a grave crime punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-person">dominate person</a> on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> creature. This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattunedâa single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of the government or army or to damage any structure in a city counts as an action against the aluumâs nature and allows the aluum a new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving throw</a> with a +2 bonus to resist the charmâs effects. If an aluum escapes this effect, it is no longer attuned and typically attacks the target who attempted to command it.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-ALUUM"></a>ALUUM CONSTRUCTION</h4>
<p>Although the secret to the creation of aluums is closely guarded, near approximations have appeared elsewhere, indicating that some have either reverse-engineered the process or have stolen those secrets. During the creation process, the souls of a dozen slaves are siphoned from their bodies as they die. Fragments of these souls are placed within the inert body of the aluum, giving it its animating force.</p>

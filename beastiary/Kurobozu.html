<h4><span id="Echo_of_Life_Su"><a name="TOC-Echo-of-Life-Su-"></a>Echo of Life (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A kurobozu retains some the same disciplined training it had in life.</p>
<p>It gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monk’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-">evasion</a>, AC bonus, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Stunning-Fist-Ex-">stunning fist</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Flurry-of-Blows-Ex-">flurry of blows</a> class features and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a> damage as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monk</a> of equal level to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. A kurobozu’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Stunning-Fist-Ex-">stunning fist</a> lasts 1 round longer than normal. In addition, a kurobozu replaces its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> modifier instead of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier.</p>
<h4><span id="Sage8217s_Bane_Su"><a name="TOC-Sage-s-Bane-Su-"></a>Sage’s Bane (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any target struck by a kurobozu’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a> takes 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> and loses an equal amount of ki (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> DC 18 negates both). For every point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> a kurobozu deals, it heals 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. Hit points received in excess of the creature’s normal total are treated as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> and dissipate after 1 minute. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Steal_Breath_Su"><a name="TOC-Steal-Breath-Su-"></a>Steal Breath (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a kurobozu can steal the breath from a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> target, as per the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suffocation">suffocation</a>, except it never causes the victim to die.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it successfully saved, the victim can’t speak for 1 minute, and its breath reeks of carrion. This also exposes the victim to the kurobozu’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or guard (3â5)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Kurobozus, also called black <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monks</a>, are jealous <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> that arise when a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monk</a> dies under circumstances that violate the precepts of his or her monastic training.</p>
<p>Kurobozus need to feed upon the breath of mortals to survive, and they usually acquire this sustenance by sneaking up on a sleeping victim, though they can just as easily draw breath from a foe <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> by their fists in combat. While this feeding doesn’t immediately kill the victim, it leaves a horrific rotting scent on the victim’s breath that can spread the kurobozu’s contagious apoxia to others, eventually leading to faintness, exhaustion, and death.</p>
<p>When they aren’t maintaining their existence through feeding, kurobozus carry out their jealous fantasies by murdering living <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monks</a>, especially members of their former monastery or monastic tradition. They still possess a shred of their former discipline, which they use to formulate long-term plans for their acts of revenge. Generally, kurobozus’ interactions with other creatures are limited to feeding and killing, but they have an affinity for malcontent ex-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monks</a> and may actually go out of their way to secretly offer protection or succor to such a person, without ever revealing their true identities. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil">Evil</a> ex-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monks</a> seeking to destroy their former masters and fellow disciples may even see the actual face of their benefactors and be able to forge lasting alliances.</p>

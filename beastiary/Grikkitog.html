<h4><span id="Barbed_Maw_Ex">Barbed Maw (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A grikkitog can extend its barbed teeth and fully impale a creature that is two or more size categories smaller than the grikkitog (a Medium or smaller creature for the typical grikkitog). This ability effectively adds the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a> universal monster ability to the grikkitogâs bite attack against such a creature, but if the grikkitog successfully âgrabsâ a foe in this manner by impaling it on the teeth, the grikkitog does not gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition. An grikkitogâs options while <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> a foe in this way are limitedâit can either move while <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> the foe, or it can whip its body and attempt to fling the foe as if using the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/awesome-blow">Awesome Blow</a> feat (the damage dealt by this is equal to its bite damage). A grikkitog can impale up to three Medium-sized (or six Small-sized) creatures at a time with its maw, while continuing to attack normally with its bites.</p>
<h4><span id="Earth_Glide_Ex">Earth Glide (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A burrowing grikkitog can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/move-earth">move earth</a> spell cast on an area containing a burrowing grikkitog flings the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aberration">aberration</a> back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save.</p>
<h4><span id="Implant_Core_Ex">Implant Core (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The grikkitog implants its core into an adjacent section of earth or stone, melding seamlessly and changing its visual appearance to match the surrounding rock. Itâs immobilized but automatically succeeds at its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> check to impersonate the stone around it; creatures actively searching for it can still attempt <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks against its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> DC as normal. A grikkitog can release its implantation as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, which has the manipulate trait. A grikkitogâs infestation aura and manifold vision are only active while implanted.</p>
<h4><span id="Infestation_Aura_Su">Infestation Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>While its core is implanted, a grikkitog infests all earth and stone within 120 feet, as long as there is a contiguous physical connection between the earth, including stone objects touching on the ground. This effect spreads even if the grikkitog does not have line of effect, though it can affect earth or stone on the surface and exposed to the air only if at least part of its core is exposed as well. Within the aura, it can grow maws and eyes everywhere. It can make bite attacks against any creature, originating from any earth or stone in the aura adjacent to that creature. Determine <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> from the origin point of the attack, not from the grikkitogâs core.</p>
<h4><span id="Magical_Strike_Ex">Magical Strike (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A grikkitogâs bite attack is treated as a magic weapon for the purposes of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Manifold_Vision">Manifold Vision</span></h4>
<p>While its core is implanted, the grikkitog can see through the eyes it creates throughout the area of its infestation aura, gaining the benefits of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-All-Around-Vision-Ex-">all-around vision</a>.</p>

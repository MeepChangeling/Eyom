<h1>Choleric Ooze Swarm</h1>
<p class="description">Dozens of tiny globs of slime move on their own, acting as one being, alternately clinging to each other and separating in a riot of oozing momentum.</p>

<h4><span id="Acid_Ex"><a name="TOC-Acid-Ex-"></a>Acid (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A wooden or metal weapon that strikes a choleric ooze swarm takes 1 point of acid damage unless the weaponâs wielder succeeds on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save. The oozeâs touch deals 8 points of acid damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> must remain in contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Corrosive_Slime_Ex"><a name="TOC-Corrosive-Slime-Ex-"></a>Corrosive Slime (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Choleric oozes are composed of caustic chemicals. Any living creature that begins its turn affected by the swarmâs viscous ability takes 1d4 points of acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by the creature takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saving throw. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Viscous_Ex"><a name="TOC-Viscous-Ex-"></a>Viscous (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As described in the sanguine ooze swarmâs special abilities, except that the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save DC is 15 and the patches are destroyed if the victim takes any amount of electricity damage.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, mass (3â7), or sludge (3â5 melancholic ooze swarms and 2â4 choleric ooze swarms)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to compose the bodies of living beings.</p>
<p>Appearing at first to be a collection of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent. Each swarm is composed of several hundred palm-sized balls of ooze that all scuttle along as a single unit.</p>

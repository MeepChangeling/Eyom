<h4><span id="Dance_of_Ruin_Su"><a name="TOC-Dance-of-Ruin-Su-"></a><b>Dance of Ruin (Su)</b></span></h4>
<p>A vrock can dance and chant as a full-round actionâat the end of 3 rounds, a crackling wave of energy explodes from the vrock, dealing 5d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within 100 feet. A DC 17 Reflex save halves this damage. For each additional vrock that joins in the dance, the damage increases by 5d6 and the DC to avoid the effect increases by +1, to a maximum of 20d6 when four or more vrocks are dancing (the DC continues to increase with additional vrocks, but the damage does not). The dance immediately ends and must be started anew if any of the participating vrocks is slain, stunned, or otherwise prevented from dancing. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Spores_Ex"><a name="TOC-Spores-Ex-"></a><b>Spores (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p>A vrock can release a cloud of spores from its body once every 3 rounds as a free action. Adjacent creatures take 1d8 points of damage from the spores, plus 1d4 points of damage per round for 10 rounds as the spores grow into thick green vines. Although ugly, the vines are harmless and wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The spores can be destroyed by casting <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bless" rel="nofollow">bless</a> on the affected creatures or by sprinkling them with holy water. This attack can also be halted by effects that remove or provide immunity to disease.</p>
<h4><span id="Stunning_Screech_Su"><a name="TOC-Stunning-Screech-Su-"></a><b>Stunning Screech (Su)</b></span></h4>
<p>Once per hour, a vrock can emit a shrill screech. All creatures except demons within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed on a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Abyss)<br/>
<b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or gang (3â10)<br/>
<b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Profane champions of the Abyss, vrocks embody all the rage, hatred, and violence of that despicable realm. As ravenous and grotesquely opportunistic as the scavengers they resemble, vrocks delight in bloodshed, relishing the sounds and sensations of ripping the still-pulsing entrails from a living husk.</p>
<p>A typical vrock stands 8 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds. Vrocks generally form from the evil souls of hateful and wrathful mortals, particularly those who were career criminals, mercenaries, or assassins.</p>
<h3><span id="Demonic_Sporulation"><a name="TOC-Demonic-Sporulation"></a>Demonic Sporulation</span></h3>
<p class="source"><b>Source</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601255527/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601255527&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&amp;linkId=T7Q7VKQJSVZLOU5J" target="_blank">PCS:DR</a></p>
<p>As vrocks grow in power by advancing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> or gaining class levels, the color and nature of the spores that infest their bodies can change. Each of the following variant spore attacks replaces the vrock’s existing spores, but does not otherwise increase the vrock’s CRâthe CR listed for each variant simply lists the minimum CR required before the vrock can gain the variant in question. Other variants not listed here could also exist.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ebon Spores (CR 11)</b>: These spores quickly slither along the victim’s body, seeking out eyes and ears and lips in an attempt to grow over these parts of the body. Each round for 10 rounds, the victim must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save (same DC as the vrock’s dance of ruin ability) or lose the ability to speak, go <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blind</a>, or go <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deaf</a> (determine effect randomly). After 10 rounds, all conditions caused by these spores end.</li>
<li><b>Pallid Spores (CR 15)</b>: A vrock can only release pallid spores once every 5 rounds. Each round these pale gray spores grow, the victim must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save (same DC as the vrock’s dance of ruin ability) to avoid becoming dominated by the vrock, as if by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-monster">dominate monster</a>. This effect ends once the spores cease growing in 10 rounds.</li>
<li><b>Scarlet Spores (CR 18)</b>: The vrock can only release its spores once every minute. Scarlet spores take root in the victim’s pores and leech willpower and personality away, inflicting 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">ability drain</a> from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> each round for 10 rounds before sloughing off and causing 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Constitution drain</a> (this final effect can be avoided entirely if the spore effect is ended early).</li>

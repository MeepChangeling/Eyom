<h4><span id="Change_Shape_Su">Change Shape (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An elawah can take the form of a Medium <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/herd-animals/ram">ram</a>–<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> hybrid. In <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> form, an elawah cannot use its gore. In ram-humanoid form, an elawah resembles a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/herd-animals/ram">ramâs</a> snout, ears, tail, wool, and horns. The elawah retains its gore attack in this form, and can wield weapons and wear armor. When in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> or hybrid form, an elawahâs speed is 30 feet.</p>
<h4><span id="Cry_of_Betrayal_Su">Cry of Betrayal (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once every 10 minutes, an elawah may cry as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. All living creatures within 30 feet of the elawah must succeed on a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to avoid being bewildered for 2d4 rounds by an unexpected revelation. While in this state, the creature can act normally. However, the creature seems hesitant to act and is considered to be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a>.</p>
<p>Abilities preventing a creature from being caught flat-footed such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-">uncanny dodge</a> do not negate this effect.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect with an audible component. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any cold<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair or flock (3â12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Thick beige wool, sharp, backward curving horns, wide hooves, and a stubby tail with a black tip are the hallmark traits of this agile yet muscular ruminant.</p>
<p>An old adage claims to âBeware of wolves in sheepâs clothing.â The elawahâs origins offer compelling testimony in support of the statement. Legend tells of a benevolent, charismatic preacher who visited isolated, seaside polar communities seeking converts for his new deity. The compassionate, fiery orator dazzled the awestruck villagers with his words of hope and message of love. Yet one night, a teenager enamored with the stylish speaker watched the cleric slip out of his tent and trudge onto the unspoiled snow toward the settlementâs edge. Curious as to where he was going at such a late hour, she snuck out in pursuit of him. After stalking him for a mile, she saw the manâs clandestine lover emerge from the darkness. The woman leapt into his arms and at that moment, the young woman met the stunned gaze of her older, married sister. Sensing an abrupt change in mood, the hunter suddenly became the hunted. Despite his righteous rhetoric, the outwardly saintly man revealed his true colors. He pushed his startled lover out of his arms and barreled toward the previously unseen spy. As he rushed toward her, horns instantly emerged from his forehead. That night, he slew the two sisters, unexpectedly birthing the elawah into the world.</p>
<p>Elawahs appear as ordinary rams in their natural state, albeit with a glimmer of intelligence and raw passion in their eyes. The elawah remains in this state while venturing across the snow. Whenever the monster visits a humanoid community, the cunning shapechanger assumes its guise as a fellow humanoid.</p>
<p>The creature may appear as a burly man with bushy hair, a scruffy beard, and abnormally large hands, or as a woman with auburn hair, a flirtatious grin, a boisterous spirit, and oversized feet. With few exceptions, the charming elawah uses its appearance to ingratiate itself into the community. In this form, the monster wields a rapier that it uses to skewer any unwelcome admirers who get too close to the conniving charlatan. When faced with equal or superior opposition, it morphs into its hybrid form and lowers its horns to deal with the offenders. Regardless of its form, elawahs offend easily and have short tempers. Emotion frequently gets the better of them, causing them to have a penchant to attack first and ask questions later.</p>
<p>Elawahs are both creatures of the wild and civilization.</p>

<p>The nagaji are a race of ophidian <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> created by true <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/naga">nagas</a> to serve as slaves. Vaguely humanlike in appearance, with scaled skin that mimics the colors and patterns of various true <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/naga">nagas</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-nagaji">nagaji</a> have forked tongues and lidless eyes, giving them an unblinking <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> that most other races find unnerving. Nagaji venerate <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/naga">nagas</a> as their creators, even going so far as to deify them. Despite the influence of their creators, nagaji maintain their own distinct cultures containing elements borrowed from those of both <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/naga">nagas</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>. They prefer warm to tropical regions and settle in wild, isolated regions such as steaming jungles, vast swamps, or volcanic mountains where they erect large temples in honor of their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/naga">naga</a> creators. These magnificent temples are surrounded by dozens of simple mud daub huts and clay brick structures, which serve as the nagaji’s homes and public buildings.</p>
<p>Nagaji typically stand between 5-1/2 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 175 pounds.</p>

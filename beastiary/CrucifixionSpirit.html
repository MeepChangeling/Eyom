<h1>Crucifixion Spirit</h1>
<p class="description">This entity appears as a gaunt and translucent humanoid with puncture injuries to both wrists and both feet. Its face is twisted in eternal pain and its eyes flicker with a reddish glow.</p>

<h4><span id="Crucify_Soul_Su"><a name="TOC-Crucify-Soul-Su-"></a>Crucify Soul (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Five times per day as an attack action a crucifixion spirit can point at a single living target within 60 feet and crucify its soul. This requires the crucifixion spirit to succeed at a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>. If successful, the targetâs soul is ripped from its body, which collapses in a heap on the ground. The targetâs soul appears as a translucent copy of the victim and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed, crucified in midair to a translucent, âXâ shaped structure, the soul held in place by translucent spikes or nails. The victim is not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> and is visible to all those viewing it.</p>
<p>A crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> to it in the round it is crucified, and one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative level</a> each round thereafter. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to remove a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative level</a> has a DC of 22. The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability for it to continue to affect a target.</p>
<p>It can direct attacks against a different opponent. A crucified creature can attempt to escape each round by making a DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. If successful, the creatureâs soul is freed from its torment and returns to its body in the same round. The target is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for one round, but afterwards can act normally. A creature slain with this ability cannot be returned to life except through the casting of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle">miracle</a>, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-resurrection">true resurrection</a> spell. Even then, there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the check fails, the creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.</p>
<h4><span id="Immune_Channel_Energy_Ex"><a name="TOC-Immune-Channel-Energy-Ex-"></a>Immune Channel Energy (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A crucifixion spirit takes no damage from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-">channel energy</a> ability, and is not affected by effects that mimic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-">channel energy</a> or are based on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-">channel energy</a> ability (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/turn-undead">turn undead</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/command-undead">command undead</a>).</p>

<p>Crucifixion spirits are most often encountered within 1,000 feet of the place of their execution, though some are found haunting burial grounds (presumably the place where their fleshly body was laid to rest). Their only purpose seems to be to torment and kill any that cross their path. They hold no memories of their former life, save the pain and suffering they endured at their time of execution, and they want all those they encounter to share in this pain.</p>

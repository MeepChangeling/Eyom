<h1>Bugbear</h1>
<p class="description">This ugly creature resembles a twisted shadow puppetâs silhouette, a wild thing of flared black and brown fur whose pelt juts out from its body at freakish angles. The crouching shadowâs ears are large and floppy, draping shoulder-length, adding to the creatureâs unnatural shape. Its eyes are too big for its head. Tremendous milk-white ovals loom on either side of the thingâs wheezy pig-like nose. Its panting mouth is filled with bristly needle-teeth spiderwebbed in disgusting strands of yellowish saliva, all vibrating to the tune of its wheezing breath.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Bugbears slink in shadow and behind closed doors. They revel in the look of terror on a foeâs face when they suddenly loom from the darkness, often with some horrible trophy in hand.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Bugbears do not enjoy protracted fighting and seek to down a foe and slip away as quickly and quietly as possible. They favor hit-and-run tactics when the situation allows, striking at the most vulnerable point or member of a group.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> A bugbear is not foolish enough to fight to the death, as that would preclude it from menacing others at a later date. It usually flees if reduced to 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>.</p>

<p>The bugbear is the largest of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Goblinoid">goblinoid</a> races, a lumbering brute that stands at least a head taller than most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>. They are loners, preferring to live and kill on their own rather than form tribes of their own kind, yet it isn’t uncommon to find small bands of bugbears working together, or dwelling in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin">goblin</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/hobgoblin">hobgoblin</a> tribes where they function as elite guards or executioners. Bugbears do not form large warrens like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin">goblins</a> or nations like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/hobgoblin">hobgoblins</a>; they prefer smaller-scale mayhem that lets them keep their favorite acts (murder and torture) on a more personal level. Humans are a bugbear’s favored prey, and most count the flesh of humanity as a dietary staple. Grisly trophies of ears or fingers are common bugbear decorations.</p>
<p>Bugbears, when they turn to religion, favor gods of murder and violence, with various <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lords</a> being favorites.</p>
<p>A typical bugbear stands 7 feet in height and weighs 400 pounds.</p>

<p>Bugbears of all kinds infest the world.</p>
<p class="header">Kardan (CR 4)</p>
<p>Kardans have dark gray fur and prove far stealthier than their lesser brethren. These bugbears sometimes possess the vexing ability to appear as something other than their terrifying selves for short periods of timeâsuch as chairs, rocks, tree stumps, or even the likenesses of loved ones.</p>
<p>Kardans gain a +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> and have the following <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>: <b>3/day</b>â<a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disguise-self">disguise self</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/minor-image">minor image</a>.</p>
<p class="header">Wikkawak (CR 4)</p>
<p>In wintry climes, albino bugbears called wikkawaks prowl the glaciers by night, hunting settlers and prowling the frosted roofs of log cabins.</p>
<p>Wikkawaks have cold <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance">resistance</a> 5 and the following <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>:</p>
<p><b>At will</b>â<a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/pass-without-trace">pass without trace</a>; <b>3/day</b>â<a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/q/quench">quench</a>.</p>
<p class="header">Murd (CR 3)</p>
<p>In swampy environs or near great rivers, another form of bugbears, called murds, is said to exist. Its fur caked in muddy earth, the thing can turn into sludge-like tar at will. Itâs said a murd fears all serpents and cannot enter a house where a snake is kept as a pet.</p>
<p>Murds have the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> ability to use a version of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form">gaseous form</a>, at will, to become viscous mud. When in mud form, a murd can squeeze through any gap water can and can âflowâ uphill, against gravity (although it must succeed on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb">Climb</a> checks as normal).</p>
<p class="header">Slate-Stalker (CR 4)</p>
<p>Some bugbears adapt to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> environs better than other goblinoids, and a relatively new species of these terrors has been rumored of late. Called slate-stalkers, these bugbears possess fur containing the gray-black-brown of most urban environments.</p>
<p>Slate-stalkers have fire <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance">resistance</a> 10 and a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks made in urban settings, and possess the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> ability to become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> to all but one creature three times per day. Except for its chosen creature, the slate-stalker enjoys all the benefits of the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility">invisibility</a> spell.</p>
<p class="header">Koblak (CR 6)</p>
<p>Some bugbears are stillborn, but suddenly wheeze in a sharp intake of breath and return to life a full hour after their dead birth. Forever half-dead, these things, called koblaks, have eyes even larger than their kin and see through walls and over hills. Koblaks are half in our world, half in the next, and they do not die easily. Time refuses to reap them, and some live for centuries.</p>
<p>They are particularly difficult to slay, and any weapon employed against them is nearly useless unless it is sprinkled with grave dirt first (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-">DR</a> 10 against any weapon not sprinkled with grave dirt) .</p>
<p>Koblaks have 8 HD, are immune to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear">fear</a> and mind-affecting effects, and possess the following <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>:</p>
<p><b>At will</b>â<a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/clairaudience-clairvoyance">clairaudience/clairvoyance</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-dead">speak with dead</a>; <b>1/day</b>â<a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/phantasmal-killer">phantasmal killer</a>.</p>
<p>Children slain by koblaks rise as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/attic-whisperer">attic whisperers</a>.</p>

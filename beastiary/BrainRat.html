<p>Brain rats seem to favor consuming the flesh of other intelligent creatures, and use their <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a> ability to pinpoint tasty meals. They then cluster in large groups and wait for their prey to pass by. They lead off with a series of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/burning-hands">burning hands</a> blasts, focusing on clearing out other threats, while several attempt to disable their primary target with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daze">daze</a>. Once their prey is isolated they swarm it in a seething, biting mass.</p>

<p>Brain rats resemble their normal cousins and are indistinguishable from normal rats. Brain rats are intelligent relatives of normal rats. They possess <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> and use them to their fullest extent.Â Brain rats live in small colonies, and often live with other species of rat to serve as camouflage and expendable fodder.Â If psionics are used in your campaign, it is advised to replace their spell-like abilities with equivalent psionic powers.</p>
<h3>Psionics</h3>
<p>When many creatures from the Tome of Horrors Complete were originally created they had psionic powers. However, Paizo has (as yet) not released any psionic rules. Instead, <a href="http://dreamscarredpress.com/dragonfly/Store/cid=14/stprod=0.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dreamscarred Press</a> has released the excellent “Psionics Unleashed” an update of the 3.5 generation of psionic rules. Where possible we have linked to the Dreamscarred Press version of a psionic power or feat. In some cases these were not found or not available so no link is provided.</p>
<p>If you use psionics in your campaign, replace the brain ratâs spell-like abilities with these psionic powers:</p>

<p>Most oni that emerge on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> do so into a new body of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> flesh, yet this is not the case for all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to engage the servitude of an oni as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-">familiar</a>, the result is something relatively unusualâan oni made flesh directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes the features of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> as its own.</p>
<p>Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules#TOC-Lawful-Evil">lawful evil</a> 7th-level spellcaster who takes the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/improved-familiar">Improved Familiar</a> feat can gain a spirit oni as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-">familiar</a>. The ritual to gain such a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-">familiar</a> requires the spellcaster to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking oni maskâthis does not require a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> check or any additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask, which immediately transforms it into the animate, living creature presented here.</p>
<p>While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them. When a spirit oni’s master dies, the spirit oni gains free will and the ability to make its own choicesâbut the spirit oni’s innate cowardice and dishonor usually prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni. Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their services to their superiors, in hopes that they might someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state to something more befitting their egos and desires.</p>

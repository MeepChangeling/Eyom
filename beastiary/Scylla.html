<p>Scyllas are thought to be related to hydras, though no proof exists connecting the two. They are found in climates from temperate to warm (they don’t like the cold) and prefer to lair in natural underwater caves and caverns, only emerging when hungry. A scylla is a predatory creature, existing on a diet of large fish such as shark, octopus or squid, or unlikely swimmers and sailors. Prey is usually devoured in the same spot it is killed; rarely does a scylla return to its lair with prey except when nursing its young.</p>
<p>Scyllas are solitary creatures and even during mating season it is rare to actually encounter more than one of these creatures. The mating ritual lasts but a short time with the male swimming away afterwards, never to return to the lair. Young are born about 6 months later and reach maturity in just under a year. Young scyllas are noncombatants and do not possess the heat ability of adult scyllas.</p>
<p>A scylla is gray-blue to dark gray in color with a lighter shaded underbelly. Its fins are gray-blue to dark gray. Its eyes are golden or gray and each mouth is lined with triple rows of whitish-gray teeth. Scyllas can grow to a length of 50 feet.</p>

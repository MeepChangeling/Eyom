<h1>Crypt Flower</h1>
<p class="description">A lone petal hangs over the opening of this bulbous, pitchershaped flower, which is flanked by a pair of serpentine vines.</p>

<h4><span id="Excavate_Ex">Excavate (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A crypt flower can use its shoots to dig rapidly through soil, dirt, sand, or other loose ground. As a result of this constant excavation activity, the ground in a 20-foot radius around a crypt flower is treated as difficult terrain for all creatures except crypt flowers.</p>
<h4><span id="Gushing_Wound_Ex">Gushing Wound (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever an opponent scores a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> on a crypt flower with a slashing or piercing weapon, the flowerâs toxic fluids squirt out.</p>
<p>The attacker and all creatures adjacent to the attacker must attempt a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or be doused in toxic fluids and thus exposed to the crypt flowerâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Poison_Ex">Poison (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Contact; <em>save</em> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 18; <em>frequency</em> 1/round for 6 rounds; <em>effect</em> 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dex</a> damage; <em>cure</em> 2 consecutive saves.</p>
<h4><span id="Toxin_Splash_Ex">Toxin Splash (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a crypt flower can dip its vines into the toxic fluids within its pitcher and fling the liquid as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon">splash weapon</a> with a range increment of 20 feet.</p>
<p>A target struck, as well as all targets in the splash radius, are exposed to the crypt flowerâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> (although creatures in the splash radius gain a +4 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saves to resist the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>). A crypt flower can use its toxin splash once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Vines_Ex">Vines (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A crypt flowerâs vines are primary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> that deal bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or copse (3â8)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Driven by pure instinct, this monstrously sized pitcher <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> is much more aggressive than its more common and harmless insect-eating kin. Though a capable <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/hunter">hunter</a>, the crypt flower has no qualms about scavenging for its sustenance and eagerly devours living or rotting flesh.</p>
<p>It maintains a proclivity for growing in graveyards and cemeteries, nursing itself on a diet of carrion, corpses, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin">vermin</a>. Because the crypt flower gains its nutrients from decomposing organisms, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> is nearly rootless and moves about by extending and retracting four thick clusters of rootlike shoots.</p>
<p>The crypt flowerâs central, pitcher-shaped bulb is larger than an average adult <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a>.</p>
<p>A single petal hovers above the opening, acting as a sort of lid above rows of jagged spines that fold inward, overlapping each other almost like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/shark/shark">sharkâs</a> teeth. As soon as a victim comes near this maw, the overhanging petal slams down and the flower rapidly constricts. Its spines gnaw upon the captured prey, drawing it into the large, hollow pitcher to be dissolved in sweet-scented but acidic and toxic nectar.</p>
<p>In certain areas, bandit gangs or criminal organizations based in rural regions have taken the somewhat dangerous tradition of using crypt flowers to dispose of unwanted bodies.</p>
<p>Since it makes no difference to a crypt flower whether it consumes an unwanted body and otherwise, complex pens or troughs are built to contain the flowers and limit their movements so that they can be âfedâ with relative safety.</p>
<p>Crypt flowers typically grow between 8 to 10 feet tall and weigh 320 pounds.</p>

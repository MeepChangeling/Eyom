<h4><span id="Aura_of_Complacency_Su"><a name="TOC-Aura-of-Complacency-Su-"></a>Aura of Complacency (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A harvest haunt projects a 100-ft aura that makes all living, non-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> creatures within the area feel complacent. Those affected by the aura must make a DC 17 will save or fall under the effects of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a>, that instructs the victim to â<i>Remain inside to eat, drink, and be merry.</i>â Since this is something most people want to do, they often take a -2 penalty on their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save as per the spell (subject to GM discretion). A creature that saves against this aura is immune to its effects for 24 hours. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> based.</p>
<h4><span id="Blighting_Touch_Su"><a name="TOC-Blighting-Touch-Su-"></a>Blighting Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The touch of a harvest haunt can convey negative energy into another being. This manifests as a cold-burning sensation that does 1d8 negative energy damage plus the harvest hauntâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate plains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or troupe (3-12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>These creatures birth their own kind by utilizing living crops, especially potatoes and corn, to lay their eggs within. Harvesting the crop kills the eggs within. Theyâre completely hermaphroditic, allowing them to remain isolated from even other Harvest haunts if need be. At best, theyâll remain near their sisters until the time comes for them to move along and lay their own eggs.</p>
<p>Harvest haunts live a very short time, around two years on average. During this time they will only lay eggs once, dying within 24 hours of their hatching. Theyâll lay an average of around 2d6 eggs, and when they hatch the young will travel back to Faerie to revel in that magical realm.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Harvest Haunts are creatures of mirth, but a catastrophe to any farmers who might find one on their property. Harvest haunts spend most of their short lives dancing the edges of the Glades of Light and Shadow, but when the days start to get shorter the Harvest haunts begin to follow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> farmers indoors. Using their innate ability for stealth, Harvest haunts enter the farmerâs house undetected and begin to use their magic. Their Aura of Complacency will cause the farmer’s crop fields to remain untended, and by harvest time theyâll be swollen with Harvest Haunt eggs.</p>
<p>Harvest haunts will remain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> most of the time, though they might reveal themselves to particularly dim-witted people so that they might play pranks on them. Theyâre selfish by nature, but love to witness other peopleâs joy. They will often provide food for the farmers during reproductive periods using their ability to create food, but the short duration of that spell makes it useless for anything other purpose. Unfortunately their method of procreation always leaves farmers in dire straits, as theyâll have no food stored for the winter.</p>

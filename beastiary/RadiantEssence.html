<h4><span id="Acid_Ex">Acid (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A radiant essence secretes a corrosive substance that dissolves organic material and metal quickly, but doesnât affect stone. Each time a creature takes damage from a radiant essenceâs acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of acid damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 25 negates damage to clothing and armor). A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a radiant essence takes 2d6 points of acid damage, unless the weaponâs wielder succeeds at a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save. If a radiant essence remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, the object takes 30 points of acid damage (no save). The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>A radiant essenceâs attacks count as good-aligned for the purpose of bypassing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> and deal an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a>. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil">Evil</a> creatures that hit a radiant essence with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> or unarmed attacks take 2d6 points of damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Sense_Evil_Su">Sense Evil (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A radiant essence automatically knows whether a creature it detects with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> has an evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a>.</p>

<p>Like many oozes, radiant essences are comprised primarily of caustic matter, but this substance is infused with holy energy that causes them to shine with a soft, glowing light. Radiant essences sense their environment by vibration and air pressure, supplemented by their instinctive knowledge of whether nearby creatures are fundamentally wicked.</p>
<p>A radiant essence is normally 8 feet in diameter and between 8 and 12 inches thick. It weighs approximately 1-1/2 tons.</p>
<p>Radiant essences are usually very similar in size, but each radiant essenceâs coloration is determined by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> that perished to form it. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">Angels</a> contribute a rich yellow, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/archon">archons</a> a shining silver, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/agathion">agathions</a> a vibrant orange, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/azata">azatas</a> a fiery red. Most radiant essences are formed from a multitude of types and are therefore a shimmering golden orange; however, radiant essences formed exclusively from one type of good <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsider</a> take on the corresponding color.</p>
<p>If not utilized within a few days of a radiant essenceâs death, the globules evaporate, their spiritual residue dissipating forever. Death by violence is the most common end of radiant essences, due to their tendency to hurl themselves at evil foes without any sense of self-preservation.</p>
<p>Barring death in combat, radiant essences are exceptionally hardy and incredibly long-lived. After several hundred years, a radiant essenceâs inner core begins to dim as its body draws upon the last of the celestial energy that sustains it. The final state of an elderly radiant essence has yet to be observed; it may ultimately break down into inert slime, or disintegrate in a final burst of dying holy power.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_And_Society">Habitat And Society</span></h3>
<p>Because radiant essences are formed from the spiritual residue of good outsiders, they are a source of awe and fascination for many religious scholars. Many sages study the appearance and formation of radiant essences to better understand the complicated process of celestial destruction and rebirth. Lore about radiant essences is incomplete, as the creatures are so rare, spurring the most dedicated sages to seek out radiant essences to study firsthand, although the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> are indifferent to this curiosity. Sometimes, a priest or scholar must interact with a radiant essence not out of inquisitiveness but out of obligation; for example, benevolent powers may direct a devotee to transplant a radiant essence to another site where its mindless crusade against evil can be of more use. For the fortunate, the radiant essence complies with its relocation, following the agent like a loyal pet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, the radiant essence is unwilling to go, forcing the agent to plead with the ooze or pray for some means to transport the obstinate creature.</p>
<p>Nearly all radiant essences inhabit a specific holy site and rarely stray far from it. Radiant essences are usually solitary, but a large sacred structure or angelic battlefield might host several. Radiant essences rarely create lairs for themselves, instead meandering around their specific holy sites, ever alert for evil creatures.</p>
<p>Radiant essences are single-minded in their pursuit of any wicked creatures they find and might pursue such a creature far from their holy site. Lacking the intellect to retrace their steps but practically immortal, wandering radiant essences continue to seek out evil creatures indefinitely. If one of these radiant essences happens upon a different holy site in its travels, and there are no evil creatures within range to fight, it might instinctively adopt the site as its new home. To existing residents of that site, such as hermits or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">monks</a>, the presence of a single-minded mass of luminous, acidic protoplasm is rarely a welcome one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">Angels</a> and other good <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> treat radiant essences with a mix of caution, pity, and sympathy. Aware that the oozes contain the residue of celestial heroes but none of their personality, some angels see radiant essences as a cautionary example of what they might become if they fall in combat. More practically, good outsiders know that radiant essences are mindless and can be unpredictable, so even they keep their distance as a sensible precaution.</p>

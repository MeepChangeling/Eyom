<h4><span id="Genie-Touched_Abilities">Genie-Touched Abilities</span></h4>
<p>Each of the four breeds of genie-touched horse (<em>istaheq</em>, <em>misayyah</em>, <em>tuanu</em>, and <em>zefaheen</em>) has three unique genie-touched abilities. In addition, each breed has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance">energy resistance</a> to a specific form of energy and can understand (but cannot speak) one elemental language.</p>
<p>Legends hold that in the distant past, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/genie">genies</a> gifted certain Keleshite tribes with the companionship of a powerful race of equine mounts. Exactly what these mysterious creatures originally were is now lost to time, but their descendants exist still in the form of four distinct breeds of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> steeds known as genie-touched horses.</p>
<p>This magnificent creature seems to be a horse, but the sparkle in its eyes reveals its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> origins.</p>
<h3><span id="Istaheq">Istaheq</span></h3>
<p class="description">The stoic istaheq are dark gray or black.</p>
<p><b>Resist</b> acid 10<br/><b>Languages</b> one local language, Terran (cannot speak any language)</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Scion_of_Stone_Ex">Scion of Stone (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Istaheqs are immune to petrification. An istaheq does not treat rubble or other uneven stone or rocky footing as difficult terrain, and it is immune to the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spike-stones">spike stones</a> and caltrops. Finally, an istaheqâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a> is +10, rather than the typical +8 for most genie-touched horses.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Steadfast_Ex">Steadfast (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">An istaheq gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on saving throws against all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> and fear effects. While serving willingly as a mount, an istaheq is immune to fear effects.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Thundering_Hooves_Su">Thundering Hooves (Su)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, an istaheq can rear up and slam its hooves down hard against the ground. For 1 round, the ground in a 30-foot radius around the istaheq shakes, allowing the istaheq to attempt a single <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip">trip</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check against all creatures standing in this area. This action does not provoke an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="Misayyah">Misayyah</span></h3>
<p class="description">Temperamental, fierce, and courageous, a misayyah usually tolerates only one rider, with whom it forms a close bondâit often grows despondent if separated from its chosen partner. Misayyahsâ coats are a shimmering metallic gold or bay, and they have intense amber eyes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Resist</b> fire 10<br/><b>Languages</b> Ignan, one local language (cannot speak any language)</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Firesight_Ex">Firesight (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A misayyah can see through fire and smoke without penalties. It is immune to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> condition, and it gains a +4 saving throw on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saves against blindness caused by bright light.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Flaming_Trail_Su">Flaming Trail (Su)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Once per day when a misayyah charges, it can leave behind a trail of fire up to 20 feet in length along its path. This functions as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wall-of-fire">wall of fire</a> (CL 7th) and lasts for 1 round. If the misayyah makes a single hoof attack after using flaming trail, it deals an additional 2d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. A creature that takes this fire damage must succeed at a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Catching-on-Fire">catch on fire</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Sunborn_Ex">Sunborn (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A misayyah gives off more body heat than a normal horse, and while a misayyah can exist comfortably in hot environments, its rider takes a â2 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throws to resist detrimental effects from hot environments while riding one. In cold environments, a misayyahâs rider is protected from the temperature as if via <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/endure-elements">endure elements</a>. During the day, while outside and above ground, a misayyah gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative">initiative</a> checks.</p>
<h3><span id="Tuanu">Tuanu</span></h3>
<p class="description">Tuanus are known for their fluid gait and intuitive responses. They are dark dappled gray with blue eyes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Resist</b> cold 10<br/><b>Languages</b> Aquan, one local language (cannot speak any language)</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Fluid_Movement_Ex">Fluid Movement (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A tuanu gains a +2 bonus to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a>. A tuanuâs rider gains a +5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride">Ride</a> checks to stay in the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/animals-animal-gear#TOC-Saddle">saddle</a> and on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a> checks attempted as a result of the motion while riding the tuanu. However, the bonus does not apply to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a> checks triggered by other causes, such as being injured while casting or when casting defensively.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Water_Sense_Ex">Water Sense (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A tuanu can use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> to dowse for water (see the dowsing skill unlock). A tuanu does not require a dowsing rod to use this ability, and it gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> checks (for a total bonus of +9) to dowse for water.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Waterborn_Su">Waterborn (Su)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A tuanu has the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> subtype and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Amphibious-Ex-">amphibious</a> special quality. It has a swim speed of 30 feet. For up to 1 hour per day, the tuanu can grant a rider the ability to breathe underwater as long as the latter remains mounted.</p>
<h3><span id="Zefaheen">Zefaheen</span></h3>
<p>Intelligent, strong willed, and fast as the wind, zefaheens are silvery gray in color and have startling gray eyes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Resist</b> electricity 10<br/><b>Languages</b> Auran, one local language (cannot speak any language)</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Air_Walker_Sp">Air Walker (Sp)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Once per day, a zefaheen can use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/air-walk">air walk</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> (CL 7th).</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Desert_Walker_Ex">Desert Walker (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A zefaheen suffers no harm from hot environments, and it never treats natural desert terrain as difficult terrain. It gains a +4 bonus on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> checks made while in a desert. A zefaheen does not leave tracks in a desert, as if under the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/pass-without-trace">pass without trace</a>.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="Sand_Sense_Ex">Sand Sense (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A zefaheen gains a +5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks in sandy desert environments, as well as a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves against illusions (including mirages). The zefaheen can see through mist or sandstorm winds.</p>

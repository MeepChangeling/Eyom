<h1>Dweomercat</h1>
<p class="description">Its coat shining vividly, this majestic tiger looks exotic and otherworldly. It gazes with piercing yellow eyes and stands calmly, as though fearless.</p>

<h4><span id="Dweomer_Leap_Su"><a name="TOC-Dweomer-Leap-Su-"></a>Dweomer Leap (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a dweomercat is targeted by a spell or within the area of effect of a spell, it can, as an immediate action, choose to teleport to a square adjacent to the spellâs caster, effectively appearing mid-leap and aimed toward the caster. This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes the dweomercatâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. If it chooses, the dweomercat can immediately make a full attack against the spellâs caster as though pouncing. Using this ability does not provoke an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. If there is no safe space adjacent to the casterâor if the dweomercat choosesâthe dweomercat can forgo using this ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Spell_Link_Su"><a name="TOC-Spell-Link-Su-"></a>Spell Link (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a dweomercat is targeted by a spell or within the area of effect of a spell, it can, as a immediate action, forgo its dweomer leap ability to gain an effect related to the school of the spell targeting it. This effect activates before the dweomercat is affected by the spell targeting it and regardless of whether or not the spell overcomes its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. Each power lasts for 1 minute per level of the spell targeting the dweomercat, until the dweomercat uses this ability again, or until the dweomercat chooses to dismiss the effect as a free action, whichever duration is shortest. This ability does not prevent the spell affecting the dweomercat from taking effect; it only provides an additional benefit.</p>

<p><b>Environment</b>any forest<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, hunt (2â3), ambush (1â3 dweomercats and 2â12 dweomercat cubs)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Powerful and regal, dweomercats prey upon lesser creatures, but even more voraciously hunt new and ever stranger sources of magic. Beings as much composed of sculpted arcane eddies as of flesh and blood, these capricious felines flourish along the intangible ley lines of their home realm, drinking in its weird powers as a plant thrives on light. Yet even more potent than their thirst for magic and the euphoria they draw from being in proximity to the reshaping of reality is dweomercatsâ racial curiosity.</p>
<p>The average adult dweomercat is about 4 feet tall and 7 feet long, weighing over 250 pounds, while their cubs are approximately 1 foot tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds.</p>
<h4><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h4>
<p>A newly born dweomercat cub is connected to its homeland by only a thin tether of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> magic, and can only tap into its true potential during the instant a spell is cast upon it. The burst of magical energy brought forth by a freshly cast spell momentarily intensifies the bond between the First World and the dweomercat. This link manifests itself clumsily as a sort of sudden teleportation that heaves the fey cat through space and time toward the source of the spell, fueled by the magnetic reaction between the dweomercat and the magicâs origin.</p>
<p>A dweomercat grows not by the passage of time, but through direct exposure to fey magic. Thus, a dweomercat cub on the Material Plane is stunted developmentally. Though it ages and gains experience and practical wisdom anywhere, only by spending several lifetimes can the cub reach adulthood. Once it has reached this stage, however, a fully grown dweomercat may freely travel between its native land and the Material Plane without adverse effects.</p>

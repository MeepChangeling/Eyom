<h1>Sepia Snake</h1>
<p class="description">Winglessly flying forth, a monstrously sized anaconda-like serpent descends from the sky. Its 30-foot body is nearly two-feet thick and covered in muddy brown scales with strange patterns and symbols on its dorsal side. Large glowing yellow orbs set in its wide, triangular head emit a haunting glare and arching its tail aggressively, it exposes a vicious-looking barbed stinger. </p>

<p>Wizards and other sages well-versed in arcane lore agree that the sepia snake was the inspiration for the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sepia-snake-sigil">sepia snake sigil</a>. The similarities between the creature and the spell are simply too great to be coincidental. Though a sepia snake can be found just about anywhere, it usually makes its lair deep underground in abandoned mines, dungeons, or subterranean caverns. It has been said that to look into the eyes of the sepia snake is to look into one’s own doom.</p>
<p>A sepia snake begins combat by using its gaze on what it believes to be its most dangerous opponents so it can safely deal with them later. In melee a sepia snake tries to avoid direct combat, and will rely on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/flyby-attack">Flyby Attack</a> feat to keep it out of danger. A sepia snake can emit a brown, web-like substance from its throat that immobilizes its opponent. Held, cocooned, or otherwise incapacitated foes are poisoned to soften them up for consumption.</p>

<p>A nightbringer ape can only use its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door">dimension door</a> in areas of dim illumination; both the departure point and destination must be in dim illumination or worse.</p>
<h4><span id="Nocturnal_Predator_Su">Nocturnal Predator (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A nightbringer ape uses the night itself as a weapon.Â In areas of dim illumination or worse, the nightbringer apeâs attacks are especially deadly; the nightbringer ape receives a +2 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>, one additional dice of damage, and a +5 bonus on itsÂ CMB andÂ CMD values.</p>
<p>These altered combat abilities are noted parenthetically above.</p>

<p>When in an area of dim illumination or worse, anytime the nightbringer ape is missed by a melee attack, it may make an additional 5 ft. step as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.

<p>Nightbringer apes are a fearsome breed of apex predator, known for their cruel craftiness. Nightbringer apes come with the setting of the sun, emerging from their blood-soaked cave lairs in unruly, savage packs.</p>
<p>These carnivorous primates move through the night with astonishing swiftness, leaping from shadow to shadow, always at the edge of perception. Nightbringer ape packs are ruled only by strength- the largest, most savage nightbringer, usually the strongest or craftiest male, commands. Challenges to rulership are common, as lesser apes challenge their king at even the smallest, most fleeting sign of weakness. A nightbringer pack is as much a threat to itself as those living in its territory.</p>
<p>Nightbringer apes are strong-bodied primates that stand more than 8 ft. tall at the shoulder. Their onyx fur reflects the starlight, and the inky black night sky seems to be a part of their bodies; the shadow spaces on their form are filled with stars. Their eyes glow emerald, the intensity flaring as the nightbringer ape gives into its most savage urges.</p>
<p>Despite their bestial intellect, nightbringers are cunning opponents. A solitary nightbringer attacks from ambush, shifting through shadows so adroitly his prey never gets an accurate count of the threat they face. If two or more nightbringers actually put aside their bull-headed pride and work together, they can slaughter entire villages.</p>

<p>All boring beetles within 1 mile of each other are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in the group is not flatfooted, then none of them are. No boring beetle in a group is considered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking">flanked</a> unless all of them are.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/> <b>Organization</b> cluster (2â5), swarm (6-â1), or hive (12â19 plus 2â8 shriekers)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Boring beetles feed primarily on wood, mold, fungus, and other organic matter. They make their lairs inside ancient tunnels and caverns, where they harvest and grow molds and fungi. Shriekers are prized for both food and their use as alarms to warn the boring beetles of intrusion. Boring beetles are about 9 feet long.</p>
<p>Boring beetles bite with their powerful mandibles. Slain victims are dragged to their lair and used to grow new molds and fungi.</p>

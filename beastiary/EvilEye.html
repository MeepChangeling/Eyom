<h1>Evil Eye</h1>
<p class="description">An enormous floating eye, apparently ripped raw from the skull of some giant beast, hovers in the air before you. Lengths of optic nerve writhe and thrash behind it like tails, fading away after several feet into thin wisps of white mist. That same white mist is visible in the eyeâs dark pupil, as though through a window to some distant world.</p>

<p>Evil eyes have no concern for any living being other than themselves (and sometimes other evil eyes). They are capable of fighting with their optic nerve âtails,â but prefer to remain at a distance and make use of their gaze attacks. Unless an evil eye believes itself outmatched, or believes it can bargain with or intimidate potential foes, it attacks without provocation. This is partly due to their obsession with acquiring magic, but also because they enjoy the kill.</p>

<h4><span id="All-Around_Vision_Ex">All-Around Vision (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As the creature is very literally a giant eye, it can see in almost all directions at once, and need merely shift its attention to view what few blind spots exist. It cannot be flanked.</p>
<h4><span id="Mystic_Sight_Su">Mystic Sight (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The evil eye sees magical emanations naturally. It is constantly treated as though under the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic"><i>detect magic</i></a>. Furthermore, it is treated as though it had spent three full rounds examining anything it sees, for purposes of recognizing the strength of auras, the school of magic, and the like. Additionally, the evil eye is also treated as though under a constant<i> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/see-invisibility"> see invisibility</a></i> effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Flight_Ex">Flight (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Although the evil eyeâs ability to fly is mystical, it is an innate part of the creature. It cannot be dispelled, and does not cease even in antimagic fields and similar effects.</p>
<h4><span id="Gaze_Attacks_Su">Gaze Attacks (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The evil eye possesses a vast repertoire of gaze attacks. Except as noted here, these follow the standard rules for gaze attacks, including methods for avoiding them, and the creatureâs ability to deliberately focus on target (perhaps forcing it to make two separate saves). </p>
<p>The evil eye can have only a single gaze attack active in a given round; switching gaze attacks is a swift action. The evil eye cannot maintain any specific gaze attack for more than one round, and must wait 1d4 rounds before activating that particular gaze attack again. Thus, even in a short battle, foes are likely to suffer the effects of multiple types of gaze attacks.</p>
<p>The evil eyeâs gaze attacks have a range of 150 feet (assuming line of sight). At any range up to 50 feet, the save DC against these gaze attacks is 17; beyond 50 feet, it drops to 15. The save DCs are Charisma-based, and the spell effects function as if cast by an 13th-level caster. The gaze attacks include:</p>
<p><i>Charm</i>: Subjects must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by <i>charm monster</i>.</p>
<p><i>Confuse</i>: Subjects must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by <i>confusion</i>.</p>
<p><i>Death</i>: Subjects must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by <i>inflict critical wounds</i> (4d8+13 damage). Subjects who successfully save suffer half damage.</p>
<p><i>Enervate</i>: Subjects must succeed on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be affected as though by <i>enervation</i>.</p>
<p><i>Immolate</i>: Subjects must succeed on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be affected as though by <i>flame strike</i> (13d6 damage). Subjects who successfully save suffer half damage.</p>
<p><i>Paralyze</i>: Subjects must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by <i>hold monster</i>.</p>
<p><i>Petrify</i>: Subjects must succeed on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be affected as though by <i>flesh to stone</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sleep</i>: Subjects must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by <i>deep slumber</i>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold hills, underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, cluster (4 or 6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard coins, standard goods, double items</p>
<p>The so-called evil eyes are also known as the Eyes of Augrah-Ma. Legend has it that Augrah- Ma himself (itself?) is some great and dark power; perhaps demon prince, perhaps a god, perhaps something else entirely. His presence is so inherently baleful that the very forces of nature prevent him from entering any of the known planes. It is said that the Augrah-Ma lurks in the emptiness between worlds.The evil eyes, though they seem to have independent minds and often pursue their own agendas, are said to literally be Augrah-Maâs eyes, allowing him to see and influence events in the material plane. Most evil eyes seem obsessed with the destruction of spellcasters, and the acquisition of magic items. They rarely make use of such items themselves, but sages theorize that they constantly seek some means of allowing Augrah-Ma to enter the world â and to make themselves supreme in his order, rising above all other evil eyes. As such, evil eyes oppose one another as often as they cooperate.</p>

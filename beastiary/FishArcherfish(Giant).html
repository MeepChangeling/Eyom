<p>By collecting water in its mouth, a giant archerfish can fire a powerful jet of water as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. The attack has a range of 30 feet with no range increment.

<p>Giant archerfish are peaceful, surface-dwelling animals that shoot a powerful stream of water at land- or airborne creatures in an attempt to fell it into the giant archerâs body of water where the fish quickly swims in and devours it. These creatures exist mainly on a diet of insects and small animals such as birds, shrimp, worms, and snails though some of the larger ones occasionally target small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> as prey. Giant archerfish are typically solitary creatures and rarely travel in schools. Schools of these fish, when encountered, do not work in concert with one another; every fish is on its own.</p>
<p>Giant archerfish are three feet long and have silver-colored bodies with vertical black stripes that begin just behind the head and fade as they near the tail. Their eyes are either cloudy blue or silver and its fins are slightly darker than its body. Some species of giant archerfish are yellowish-gray with dark-colored eyes, but all have the vertical black stripes. Giant archerfish can grow to be five feet long.</p>
<p>The giant archerfish spends most of its time near the surface where it uses its water spray to dislodge potential prey from their land-based perch and knock them into the water. The archerfish then darts in and bites. This fishâs eyes are formed in such a way that allows it to see perfectly into the air or on land from a depth of six feet without any distortion or refraction.</p>

<h1>Iron Wight</h1>
<p class="description">This giant humanoid form is a jumble of mismatched limbs, metal shards, glass, and wires. A single red crystal orb glares angrily from the skull embedded in its metallic head.</p>

<p>An iron wight gains a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> on attack and damage rolls against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> and robots.</p>
<h4><span id="Energized_Fists_Ex">Energized Fists (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An iron wight incorporates parts from the robots it destroys, granting the wight integrated weapon systems that add 2d6 energy damage to its slam attacks. Choose one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, plasma (half electricity, half fire), or sonic.</p>
<h4><span id="Rebuild_Su">Rebuild (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An iron wight can reform its body from destroyed robots. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, an iron wight touching the remains of a destroyed robot heals 5d6 points of damage. An iron wight can only use this ability once on the same robot. When using this ability, the iron wight can change the type of energy damage inflicted by its energized fists as it incorporates new parts.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold to temperate plains<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or band (3-5)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>When a raging barbarian dies destroying a robot, sometimes the anger of the barbarianâs spirit is so great that it lives on in undeath as an iron wight, forming a new body from the remains of its foe. An iron wight is typically 10 feet in height and weighs 2,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Iron wights roam wastelands, tracking and destroying their former kin and robots alike until defeated a second time.</p>
<p>Their incomplete understanding of robots means the spirits never fully integrate or understand their host bodies. Iron wights move in a jerky, frenzied fashion. They cannot speak, but incorporated voice modules often allow them to produce electronic howls, keening, and roars when they attack. On rare occasions, an iron wight might utter a single word or phrase without context, their words sometimes cryptic and eerie.</p>

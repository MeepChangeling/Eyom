<h4><span id="Absorb_Magic_Ex">Absorb Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> fails to overcome Vorgozenâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>, it is wholly or partially absorbed by the kaiju. If the spell was an area-effect spell or targeted more than just Vorgozen, it functions normally against other targets and Vorgozen regains a number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> equal to double the spellâs level. If the spell targeted only Vorgozen, she absorbs the entire spell and regains a number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> equal to 10 Ã the spellâs level. Whenever Vorgozen absorbs magic in this way, her polluted <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-aura">magic aura</a> grows more powerful (whether or not the absorbed magic healed her of damage); all rolls to determine the effect of polluted magic are modified by +20 for the remainder of the round.</p>
<h4><span id="Acid_Beam_Su">Acid Beam (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once every 4 rounds, Vorgozen can unleash a beam of foul acid. This creates a 1,200-foot line of high-pressure caustic fluid. All creatures caught in the area of effect take 20d6 points of acid damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage, and are knocked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>. A creature that succeeds at a DC 43 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save takes half damage and avoids being knocked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>. A Huge or smaller creature that is knocked <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a> is also pushed away from Vorgozen. A Huge creature is pushed back 10 feet, a Large creature 20 feet, a Medium creature 40 feet, and Small or smaller creatures 80 feet. Creatures that are pushed take 1d6 additional points of bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they are pushed, but can attempt a DC 43 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save to halve this additional damage. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Infuse_Terrain_Su">Infuse Terrain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, Vorgozen can dematerialize and seep into the terrain, infusing it with her polluted nature. The kaiju appears to simply melt into the surrounding terrain when she uses this ability, vanishing from view. The terrain in a 1-mile radius becomes infused with the kaijuâs essenceâif the terrain is swamp or other wetland, the radius increases to 10 miles. While infusing terrain, Vorgozen cannot be harmed, and all magical effects generated in the region can trigger polluted effects (see Polluted Magic below). Vorgozen remains aware of what takes place in the region of infused terrain, and she can remain infused in the terrain indefinitely, during which time she does not need to breathe, eat, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep">sleep</a>. She can emerge from the terrain at any point within the infused region as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, gaining the benefit of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal">heal</a> spell (CL 20th) when she does so. Alternatively, she can suppress all effects of her presence on the terrain for up to 24 hours to move at a speed of 50 miles per hour, as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shadow-walk">shadow walk</a>. When she ceases moving (typically upon arriving at a region with powerful magic that has drawn her attention), her presence remains suppressed and she cannot move for the remainder of the 24 hours, at which point the suppression ends and her presence again infuses the surrounding terrain.</p>
<h4><span id="Polluted_Magic_Su">Polluted Magic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Vorgozenâs presence pollutes magic, causing magical abilities to become unreliable when used within 300 feet of the kaiju. When a creature within this area generates a spell, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> effect, roll on the table below to see how Vorgozenâs polluting presence hampers or transforms the effect. Effects created by creatures outside of this 300-foot aura are unaffected by Vorgozenâs polluted magic, even if the effect of the spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> ability enters the area of polluted magic or targets Vorgozen.</p>
<p>Likewise, ongoing spell effects or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> effects are not polluted when Vorgozenâs aura envelops them. Vorgozenâs own <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> abilities never trigger polluted magic effects.</p>

<h4><span id="Swallow_Whole_Ex">Swallow Whole (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If a creature that is swallowed whole by Vorgozen manages to escape by cutting itself free, Vorgozenâs gelatinous body simply seals over the hole created so that other swallowed creatures must cut their own way out.</p>

<p>Most kaiju are ancient creatures that have dwelled in hidden lairs since the dawn of civilization, prehistoric monsters woken from eons-long slumbers, or alien entities who visit the world only rarely. But Vorgozen (referred to as the Shapeless Feeder by some, and as Queen Vorgozen by those who wish to see all magic abolished from the world) is a relatively recent addition to the worldâs kaiju. This accidental but overwhelmingly powerful creation was forged from the unfortunate combination of hubris and arrogance. The absolute <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/destruction">destruction</a> of the remote academy in an immense fen that gave rise to the Shapeless Feeder left few clues as to the nature of the potent magic the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a> there were toying with. What hints remain suggest it involved reverse-engineering an artifact in an attempt to distill the potent powers held within the core of a once-flying city.</p>
<p>Born as she was out of the abuse of magical power, Vorgozen is very much a personification of the arrogant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizard</a> who values the study and mastery of magic and the pursuit of arcane power over all else. The Shapeless Feeder was not content to remain at the epicenter of her accidental creation, and has instead seeped through the world, drawn by powerful magical auras or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> foci. Fortunately for civilization, after emerging to destroy, the Shapeless Feeder invariably retreats to vast swamplands such as the site of her <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/genesis">genesis</a> to hibernate for decades before rousing once again from her slumber.</p>
<p>The powerful magic of other kaijuâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> abilities is particularly coveted by Vorgozen, and she enjoys polluting these effects more than any other. She is often drawn to places where other kaiju rampage as a result.</p>
<p>Queen Vorgozen is an immense mound of protoplasm nearly 80 feet in diameter. She weighs 24,000 tons.</p>

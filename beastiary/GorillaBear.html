<p>Gorilla bears are the result of a magical crossbreeding and merging of two distinct species a gorilla and a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/bear/black-bear">black bear</a>. A gorilla bearâs fur is always dark and ranges in color from jet black to brownish-black. Its paws and feet end in elongated nails, brown in color. A typical gorilla bear stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 1,700 pounds. Its eyes are always one of two colors crimson or emerald green. No other eye color has ever been seen on a gorilla bear (though legends speak of an immensely powerful white-Furred gorilla bear with eyes the color of amethysts).</p>
<p>Gorilla bears make their lairs in caves or caverns, often hidden among the twisted tangle of trees and shrubs of jungles. They are diurnal (daylight) hunters and feast on a diet of meat, savoring the taste of goblins and elves. A typical lair contains a mated pair and 1d4 young.</p>

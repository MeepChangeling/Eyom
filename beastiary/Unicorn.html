<p>This ability continually duplicates the effect of the spell. The unicorn cannot suppress this ability.<br/> </p>

<p>A unicorn’s gore attack is treated as a magic good weapon for the purposes of damage reduction.<br/> </p>
<h4><span id="Wild_Empathy_Su">Wild Empathy (Su)</span></h4>
<p>This works like the druid’s wild empathy class feature, except the unicorn has a +6 racial bonus on the check. Unicorns with druid levels add this racial modifier to their wild empathy checks.<br/> </p>

<p>Unicorns are fierce, intelligent creatures of the forest, noble beasts who keep their own counsel and typically appear only to defend their homes against evil. They universally shun all creatures except for good-aligned fey, good-aligned humanoid women, and the woodlands’ native animals, though they may fight alongside other good creatures against common enemies. A typical unicorn is 8 feet long and 5 feet tall at the shoulder, weighing 1,200 pounds.</p>
<p>Unicorns mate for life, and the pairs generally make their homes in specific glades or dells within the vast forests they protect (these regions can cover anywhere from a few dozen square miles to hundreds). They allow good and neutral creatures to pass through, hunt for food, or reside in their woods unharmed, but evil creatures and those who damage the local ecosystem more than necessary through sport hunting or commercial logging are swiftly driven out or killed. On rare occasions, lone unicorns without mates or whose partners have been slain have been known to adopt young women of exceptionally pure virtue as surrogates, allowing the women to ride on their backs and becoming their guardians and protectors for life. This bond generally ends amiably if the woman becomes more committed to someone elseâsuch as a lover or childâgiving rise to the myth that unicorns only befriend virgins.</p>

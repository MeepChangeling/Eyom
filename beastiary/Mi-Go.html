<h4><span id="Deceptive_Ex"><a name="TOC-Deceptive-Ex-"></a>Deceptive (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mi-go is a master of deception. It gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff">Bluff</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> checks. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff">Bluff</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> are always class skills for a mi-go.</p>
<h4><span id="Evisceration_Ex"><a name="TOC-Evisceration-Ex-"></a>Evisceration (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mi-go’s claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing surgical operations upon <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> creatures or those it has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a>. When a mi-go makes a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check, in addition to any other effects caused by a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>, it deals <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack">sneak attack</a> damage to the victim. A creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">ability damage</a> from the invasive surgery (the type of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">ability damage</a> dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Item_Creation_Ex"><a name="TOC-Item-Creation-Ex-"></a>Item Creation (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mi-go possesses the ability to create strange items that blur the line between magic and technology, given time and resources. This ability allows a mi-go to ignore all of the Item Creation feat requirements and spellcasting requirements for creating a magic item; the resulting item is always mi-go technology. A mi-go can use the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal">Heal</a> skill to craft mi-go technology. When a mi-go uses this ability to craft an item, it must use a larger amount of strange ingredients and expendable resourcesâthis effectively doubles the gp cost to create the item.</p>
<h4><span id="Starflight_Su"><a name="TOC-Starflight-Su-"></a>Starflight (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes 3d20 years (or more, at the GM’s discretion)âprovided the mi-go knows the way to its destination.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, scouting party (3â8), or invasion (9â16)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>This unnaturally graceful creature has a bulbous fungoid lump for a head, spiny insectoid wings, and a tangle of spiky, clawed legs.</p>
<p>Mi-go are both scientists and colonistsâextraterrestrial travelers from the Dark Tapestry who view the universe as a canvas to be mastered and controlled. Their numbers on any particular planet can vary, but taken on a galactic scale, these numbers can only be mind-numbing in scope. A typical mi-go is roughly the size of a human, but weighs only 90 pounds.</p>
<p>Although a mi-goâs shape might suggest an arthropod, especially with its long, insectlike limbs and diaphanous wings, the creature is in fact a highly evolved form of extraterrestrial fungus. Mi-go communicate via a combination of clicking of pincers and subtle shifts in the coloration of their bulbous headsâother creatures can learn this language, but without similar biologies (or the ability to mimic these noises and colors with illusions) can only hope to âlistenâ to a mi-go. A mi-go can speak in a strange, buzzing voice, but generally only does so when forced to speak to other creatures.</p>
<p>The mi-go language consists of pulsations and flashes of a wide range of colors (some of which canât be seen by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>) generated on a mi-goâs head. This language can be learned by other creatures, but they cannot use it to âspeakâ to others without the use of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> magic capable of generating the complex series of colors. Even then, most creatures can convey only basic notions and concepts.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Mi-go goals on the planets they invade and colonize can vary, from stripping them of mineral resources to seeking biological resources for their scientific experiments. Mi-go are often viewed as gods or demons by the more primitive societies they encounter, and are fond of capitalizing upon these fears to further their own agendas. Masters of disguise, they often infiltrate societies so as to better manipulate, harvest, and eventually consume the society for their own needs. Despite their skill in this regard, they generally keep the core strongholds of their operations in remote regionsâhilly and mountainous areas are favored for the preponderance of caves and other natural features that are easily converted into defensible hideouts.</p>
<p>Although masters of strange biological technologies, migo are also quite fervent in religious matters. Most worship Shub-Niggurath, for they view this goddessâs fecundity as the pinnacle of their own biological technologies and skills. A mi-go sees very little difference between the cold hard facts of science and the intensely interpretative complexities of faith.</p>
<h3><span id="Mi-Go_Technology"><a name="TOC-Mi-Go-Technology"></a>Mi-Go Technology</span></h3>
<p>The mi-go mastery of surgical and biological technologies incorporates the magical; the techniques they utilize in their pursuit of world colonization manifest in a wide range of strange and frightening tools. These devices merge magic and technology in strange and unsettling ways. For the most part, mi-go technology functions identically to normal magic itemsâthe devices simply look disturbing and weird to other creatures. The function of mi-go technological items can be identified as if they were normal magic items, but with a â5 penalty on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> check. Likewise, attempts to utilize mi-go technology with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device">Use Magic Device</a> take a â5 penalty. At the GMâs discretion, after a character becomes familiar with mi-go technology (perhaps after identifying or using the items over the course of an adventure or two), these penalties might vanish.</p>
<p>While you can simulate mi-go technology by simply describing existing magic items as strange and unusual things (a mi-go potion of cure serious wounds might look like a syringe filled with bubbling blue liquid, for example, while a mi-go rod of thunder and lightning might look like a strange rifle-like device made of crystal and pulsating fleshy veins, and might deal cold damage in place of electrical damage), other items should be more unique, such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/brain-cylinder">this example</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Blood-Healing-Su-"></a>Blood Healing (Su)</h4>
<p>Whenever a creature within 30 feet of a seraptis takes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage caused by that seraptis, the blood flows through the air into the seraptis’s maw, and the seraptis heals an equal amount of damage.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Compelling-Domination-Su-"></a>Compelling Domination (Su)</h4>
<p>When a seraptis uses <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-person">dominate person</a>, its victims do not actively resist and never gain a new saving throw when ordered to take actions against their nature.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Gaze-of-Despair-Su-"></a>Gaze of Despair (Su)</h4>
<p>Creatures within 30 feet of a seraptis that fail a DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save take 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Charisma drain</a> and are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1d6 rounds. If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Charisma drain</a> would reduce a creature’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> to 0, that creature instead succumbs to overwhelming suicidal urges and attempts to end its life by the most convenient method at hand, subject to the GM’s discretion. The creature remains in that state until its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> is restored to its normal maximumâotherwise, the victim must be restrained at all times to prevent further suicide attempts.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Multi-Arm-Grab-Ex-"></a>Multi-Arm Grab (Ex)</h4>
<p>When a seraptis successfully grabs a creature, the maws on her arms begin to gnaw on it. This ability functions as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a>, except the damage type is bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. A seraptis gains a cumulative +4 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> attempts with her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a> ability for each successive claw attack after the first that hits a given target that round.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Abyss)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or cult (1 seraptis plus 1â2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/glabrezu">glabrezus</a> and 2â6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubi</a>)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> double (+1 <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Wounding">wounding</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar">scimitar</a>, other treasure)</p>
<p>Statuesque and hauntingly beautiful (at least, until the toothy wounds on their arms gape open), seraptis demons are formidable combatants and typically function as bodyguards or lone champions for their masters, but many of these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> have achieved greater glory on their own as rulers of subdomains in greater Abyssal realms.</p>
<p>A seraptis demon stands 7 feet tall and weighs 230 pounds.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</h4>
<p>Seraptis demons form from the souls of those who, in the act of committing suicide, caused an unusual amount of despair, destruction, or mayhem. A quiet death in a dark room might result in the soul becoming a seraptis if the victim was a well known and beloved political figure whose suicide compelled his followers to riot and murder. A plunge from a high tower into a crowded marketplace might result in a small amount of collateral damage if the jumper lands atop a passerby, but this would not normally doom the suicide to existence as a seraptis. Suicide by detonating a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/necklace-of-fireballs">necklace of fireballs</a> in the middle of a wedding, on the other hand, would likely result in the dead soul becoming a seraptis.</p>
<p>With one exception, those who deliberately commit suicide in an attempt to have their souls transform into seraptis demons instead find themselves manifesting upon the Abyss as larvaeâthe Abyss does not reward deliberate suicide with such power as a seraptis wields. The ritual by which such a worshiper can transcend mortal life and transform into a seraptis is one of the cultâs most closely guarded secrets, and one that is only revealed to the most heretical and deviant of the faithful. Seraptis demons formed in this manner always retain their previous lifeâs personality and memories, although they lose all class-based abilities in the transition.</p>
<h3>Habitat &amp; Society</h3>
<p>Although the seraptis champions and assassins are well feared, the true terrors of their kind are those who have broken free from servitude to more powerful demons and, in so doing, have established themselves as ruling forces. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> are all advanced serapti with several class levels, ranging from CR 19 to CR 22. These seraptis demons have undergone a secret suicide ritual to transform into <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a>. None have yet ascended to the vaunted rank of nascent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lord</a>, for they hope to someday transcend as a group into a full-fledged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lord</a> by undertaking a hideous suicide pact, bypassing the convoluted and dangerous step of nascence most demon lords must endure.</p>

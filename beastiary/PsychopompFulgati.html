<h1>Psychopomp, Fulgati</h1>
<p class="description">This towering, muscular, female figure wears an iron, ram-headed mask. Four stout arms crackle with primal energies, while four additional arms emerge from her hips, supporting her bulk in place of legs.</p>

<h4><span id="Aura_of_Calamity_Ex">Aura of Calamity (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A fulgatiâs presence warps probability and makes tragedy more likely. Any result of a natural 1 on a d20 roll within 300 feet of a fulgati results in a reversal of the desired effect: a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check makes the target a hated enemy, an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a> injures the attacker or an ally, a failed saving throw against a spell increases the damage or duration by 50%, and a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a> check turns the spellâs effects back upon the caster. Psychopomps are immune to this effect. A fulgati cannot suppress this ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Paramnesia_Ex">Paramnesia (Ex)</span></h4>
<h4><span id="Poisonous_Blood_Ex">Poisonous Blood (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Any attack with a piercing or slashing melee or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapon</a> that damages the fulgati exposes the attacker to this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. The space a fulgati occupied when it was attacked is also tainted and rendered supernaturally unable to support plant life for 5 years per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> of the injured fulgati (125 years for most). The fulgatiâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> has its full effect on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> as well, even those normally immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>, dealing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> in place of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>.</p>
<p>Fulgati Blood: Sprayâcontact; save <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 29, frequency 1/minute for 10 minutes, effect 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> damage, cure 2 consecutive saves.</p>
<h4><span id="Quintessence_Su">Quintessence (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A fulgati absorbs the motivating force of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a> victims, collecting 1 Quintessence Point for every <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> of a creature that dies within 50 feet of it. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, it can cast animate object as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like</a> ability, treating its current Quintessence Point total as its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a>. After using this ability, the fulgatiâs Quintessence Point total resets to 0. Objects animated by a fulgati remain active and hostile until destroyed. A fulgati can store a maximum number of Quintessence Points equal to double its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (50 for most fulgatis).</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The monolithic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> known as fulgatis reap not souls but entire cultures. They tread upon the land when a civilization that has reached the end of days must be wiped away for new things to grow from its corpse. Their arrival heralds the end of cities, nations, and even entire species.</p>
<p>They are simpleminded, loyal, and utterly devoid of the compassion that defines so many other psychopompsâ terrible things created and directed with terrible purpose.</p>
<p>These titanic psychopomps are too aggressive to collect souls, and instead rend souls free and allow their lesser kinâalways close at hand when fulgatis marchâto shepherd their victims to Purgatory. What fulgatis do collect is the motivating life force, or quintessence, of the creatures they slay, pooling it until they invest it into the rubble around them to animate earth and stone as minions to assist in their destruction. These animated soldiers sometimes remain active for decades or even centuries after the psychopompsâ grim work is done, tearing down what ruins remain and ensuring no trace of a destroyed civilization can ever be reclaimed.</p>
<p>Fearsome psychopomps of last resort, a dozen known fulgatis slumber in isolated sepulchers. Many psychopomps note that the structures housing the fulgatis continue far down along the Spireâs length, well beyond the reaches of where they are permitted to travel, and it is possible that more of these powerful reapersâor even more powerful manifestations of their kindâslumber at the Spireâs base, waiting to tear it down at the end of the cosmos.</p>
<p>The fulgatisâ ability to cast <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plane-shift">plane shift</a> means the willful among them can escape and even hide for centuries at a time, reaping not at the Lady of Gravesâ command, but at whim. Teams of psychopomps relentlessly hunt these wayward destroyers, but few among their number, save the legendary yamarajes, can stand to the reapers of realms. Some psychopomps compare these wild fulgatis and their lust for random destruction to the spawn of destruction. Other claim that the souls are too terrible to exist freely, and so the Gray Lady devours them and rebirths them as new monstersâones she alone can control.</p>
<p>Despite the fulgatisâ incredible power, few outside the courts of Purgatory are even aware they exist.</p>
<p>The mortal need to turn away from death is so powerful that living minds often wipe clean any encounter with a fulgati, leaving survivors to rationalize the destruction and death left in their wake as terrible accidents and natural disasters. Because of this, mortal scholars are unsure how oftenâor even ifâthe fulgatis have ever been unleashed upon the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. The reapers may be unleashed upon the world every few centuries, or they may simply slumber and exist only in nightmares and legend.</p>
<p>Fulgatis resemble massive, female forms bearing eight stout arms, four of which serve them in place of legs. Their unusual locomotion allows them to climb and burrow with ease, even springing forth from the earth in the midst of their targets. While they wear no clothing, their flesh resembles worked metal and stone carved into elaborate whorls and patterns, giving the illusion of magnificent armor. The horns they bear are perfectly functional and deadly in close combat.</p>
<p>A fulgati stands 80 feet tall and weighs 150â175 tons.</p>

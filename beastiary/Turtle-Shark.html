<h1>Turtle-Shark</h1>
<p class="description">From a distance this creature resembles a giant snapping turtle. It has a peaked and craggy shell from which protrude four long fins and a scowling head at the end of a long neck. Rather than a turtle’s head, however, this creature’s head has irrefutably shark-like features. It has round, black eyes and a gaping maw filled with rows of razor sharp teeth.</p>

<p>A turtle-shark surprises many foes with its quickness in the water. Many assume that it is as slow as its other shelled kin, and underestimate its shark-like speed. Like its predatory cousins, a turtle-shark attacks nearly anything it can reach, especially if there is blood or activity in the water.</p>

<h4><span id="Capsize_Ex">Capsize (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A turtle-shark can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a> attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession">Profession</a> (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger than the turtle-shark’s size, it takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.</p>
<h4><span id="Shell_Ex">Shell (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If severely threatened, a turtle-shark can completely withdraw into its shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When withdrawn, a turtle-shark gains a +8 bonus to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class">Armor Class</a> and a +4 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saves.</p>

<p>A turtle-shark is a giant hybrid animal, which many think is a product of the same twisted magic that created the owlbear. These vicious marine predators have developed a taste for humanoid flesh, and routinely patrol shipping lanes in the hopes of making a tasty meal out of any sailor that has the extreme misfortune of falling overboard. Much like a shark’s, the teeth of a turtle-shark constantly replace themselves throughout the centuries-long life of the turtle-shark.</p>
<p>If the belly of a turtle-shark is cut open, it might contain the indigestible belongings of its previous meals.</p>
<p>Turtle-sharks average 20 feet in length and weigh about 10,000 pounds. It shell is dark greenish-brown or dull green mottled with brown splotches. Its head and fins are dark grayish-green.</p>

<h4><span id="Cricket_Leap_Ex">Cricket Leap (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A Thanatos fey cannot fly, but it can leap adroitly. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, the thanatos fey can leap up to 30 ft. in any combination of horizontal and vertical movement. It never provokes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> for moving in this manner.</p>
<h4><span id="Decompose_Corpse_Su">Decompose Corpse (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A Thanatos fey can accelerate the decay of a Huge or smaller corpse. By remaining in contact with the corpse for at least an hour, the thanatos fey reduces the corpse to picked bones, as if it had decayed for at least a year.</p>
<h4><span id="Harry_Ex">Harry (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If the thanatos fey successfully attacks the same targets on consecutive rounds, it deals additional damage to that target. Each successful attack doubles the weaponâs base damage (1 pt, 2 pts, 4 pts, 8 pts, 16 pts, and so on). There is no limit to the number of consecutive successful attacks (and resulting doubling damage) the thanatos fey can inflict. A missed attack, or attacking another target ends the cycle.</p>
<h4><span id="Necrotic_Aura_Su">Necrotic Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The Thanatos fey radiates a palpable aura of rot, corruption and decay. All wounds inflicted within 30 ft. of the thanatos fey gain ongoing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> 1, and all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> saves are made at a -4 penalty.</p>
<h4><span id="Poison">Poison</span></h4>
<p>Thanatos fey coat their weapons with giant wasp poison.</p>
<p>Giant wasp poison (injury) save <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 18; <i>duration</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dex</a> damage; <i>cure</i> 1 save</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any forest<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Thanatos fey are bloodthirsty, exceedingly violent fey that worship and assist the natural processes of death and decomposition. The squirrel-sized fairies make it a point to bleed some animal and watch it die, and decay to black earth at least once a day. In the hours after a particularly bloody kill, the thanatos feyâs forest rings with high voices lifted in giddy, squealing song and laughter. Thanatos fey usually murder and decompose healthy animal specimens, ones that have already bred, but if given the chance to kill a humanoid, they will gleefully take it.</p>
<p>Thanatos fey are stunningly beautiful, but for their soulless, sharklike obsidian eyes. They dress in ragged leathers and hides they stitch themselves, and adorn themselves with the bones of small birds and mammals. In battle, they move almost too fast to be seen. They are almost impossible to land a clean hit on, cackling madly as they dance nimbly around arrows and incoming spells. They continually taunt their intelligent victims with a high-pitched lecture on the processes of decomposition, and mockingly invite them to return their biological energy to the soil.</p>

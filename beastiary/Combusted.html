<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Vial">vial</a> of water can be used as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon">splash weapon</a> against a combusted, dealing 1d4 points of damage on a hit or 1 point of damage on a splash. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Holy-Water">Holy water</a> deals double damage to a combusted. Rainfall deals 1d6 points of damage per round to a combusted, and full immersion in water deals 6d6 points of damage per round.</p>
<p>Despite this, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> fires that burn in a combusted cannot be extinguished by mere water, and a combusted cannot be reduced to fewer <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> than it has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (5 hp for most combusted) by water alone.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or effigy (2â6)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>However they return, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures known as combusted all suffer the telltale signs of their demise: their corpses constantly burn and their desiccated flesh is never fully consumed by the flames. Roiling clouds of smoke, thick with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Stench-Ex-">stench</a> of burning skin and hair, surround them at all times, and may reveal their presence from over a mile away. These shambling horrors can arise at any location that has a particular affinity for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, but they have been known to wander into nearby bodies of water in an attempt to extinguish the flames that took their lives, though they never attempt such self-destructive acts when affronted by the presence of the living.</p>
<p>A typical combusted stands the same height as the creature it was in life, but weighs less than half as much, since so much of its body and musculature has burned away to ashes.</p>

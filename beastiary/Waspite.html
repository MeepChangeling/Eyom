<h1>Waspite</h1>
<p class="title">Waspite <span class="level">CR 1</span></p>
<p class="description">The sky seems to wobble with an otherworldly drone and you can almost feel a tinge of electricity as a lightning-laced wasp the size of a manâs hand hovers into view, followed quickly by more of the aerial insects.</p>

<p>Waspites are curious otherworldly creatures that can appear anywhere, though they almost always emerge from particularly vicious storms. The unnatural buzzing of their sizeable wings creates a drone throughout the air that roils like thunder as a maelstrom of waspites descends on an area to hunt, scorching the land aflame with their electrified stingers before moving on to wreak havoc elsewhere. Many attempts have been made to communicate with the creatures (as theyâve shown some low levels of intelligence) but if anyone has successfully done so word of the feat hasnât spread yet. Current theories claim they âtalkâ to one another in some form of nonverbal communication, using the light of their stingers in conjunction with their limbs to converse.</p>

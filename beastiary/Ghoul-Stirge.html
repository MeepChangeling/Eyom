<h1>Ghoul-Stirge</h1>
<p class="description">This human-sized creature looks like a cross between a large bat and a giant mosquito. Its wings are leathery and gray and its skin is drawn tight across its bones. The creature has eight pincer-like legs and a long needle-like snout. Its eyes glow pale blue. </p>

<p>A ghoul-stirge resembles a large stirge with rotting flesh and broken wings. The origin of the ghoul-stirge has been lost, but it is believed to be the result of a failed magical experiment conducted in ages past by a group of evil and (thought to be) insane necromancers. Though they can generally be encountered anywhere, ghoul-stirges seem to favor desolate places such as ruins and caverns or dungeons deep underground. Being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> they do not have to eat, but seem to draw sustenance from the blood of enemies (much like a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/vampire">vampire</a>).</p>
<p>A ghoul-stirge is about 5 feet long with a wingspan almost twice its length. Ghoul-stirges seem to understand Common, but apparently cannot (or choose not to) speak it.</p>
<p>A ghoul-stirge attacks by swooping down on its opponent and attempting to paralyze it with its bite attack. Opponents that resist its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Paralysis-Ex-or-Su-">paralysis</a> are attacked again, while <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> opponents are drained of their blood at the first opportunity. (A ghoul-stirge wonât ignore other foes to drain the blood from a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> enemy.)</p>

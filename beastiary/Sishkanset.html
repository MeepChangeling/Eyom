<h4><span id="Chilling_Touch_Su">Chilling Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A sishkanset can make a melee <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> that deals 6d8 points of cold damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Disorienting_Gale_Su">Disorienting Gale (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once every 1d4 rounds, a sishkanset can create a 60-foot line of freezing, madness-laced winds. Creatures caught in the gale take 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 4d6 points of cold damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 19 half). Creatures damaged by the gale must also succeed at a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a> for 1 round. The <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">confusion</a> is a sonic, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect. The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Eavesdropper8217s_Veil_Su">Eavesdropper’s Veil (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A sishkanset can use its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> on any creature within 1 mile to which it has line of effect. Additionally, using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a> or its whispering persecution ability does not end the sishkanset’s <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility">invisibility</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Insidious_Winds_Su">Insidious Winds (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A sishkanset’s presence suffuses local winds, causing natural light winds within 5 miles of the sishkanset to increase to moderate (11-20 mph). Moderate or greater wind forces are unaffected. If the sishkanset is destroyed, natural wind conditions return within 1 hour.</p>
<h4><span id="Whispering_Persecution_Su">Whispering Persecution (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Sishkansets temporarily relieve their anguish by driving others to madness. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a sishkanset can wrap susurrating currents of ethereal wind around a creature within 5 miles to which it has line of effect. The currents deliver maddening ramblings audible only to the target creature, and the sishkanset must maintain the currents by remaining within 5 miles of the target and concentrating for 1 minute each day. After every 24 hours that a creature is the target of this ability, it must succeed at a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw or take 1d3 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a>. Damage caused in this way cannot reduce a creature’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> score below 1. A sishkanset can affect only one creature at a time with whispering persecution. This is a sonic, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>, curse effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p>Creatures able to see <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> or ethereal objects perceive the currents as translucent gray threads that ultimately lead to the sishkanset.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane">Ethereal Plane</a>)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Formed from the fabric of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane">Ethereal Plane</a>, sishkansets are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> reflections of mortal psyches. Born of the disorientation and despair of souls whose mortal vessels died isolated and buffeted by wilderness winds, sishkansets haunt sparsely settled frontiers. They wield the same winds that tormented their progenitors in their final moments; a sishkanset’s presence disrupts the atmosphere for miles around, and though the natural winds they stoke are not inherently dangerous, they are maddeningly constant.</p>
<p>Sishkansets sift through mortal thoughts in the hope of reassembling their own fragmented personalities, but their fundamentally incomplete nature makes this an unattainable goal. When a sishkanset’s suffering becomes overwhelming, it visits its condition on others, slowly driving its victims insane through unending wind and discordant whispers.</p>
<p>A sishkanset is about 8 feet tall and unnaturally thin.</p>
<p>Sishkansets’ progenitors are those who perish in the wilderness, lost and utterly alone with only endless, mocking winds to usher their spirits from their bodies. Such souls carry enough despair that their passage through the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane">Ethereal Plane</a> leaves a psychic impression. Powerful negative emotions whip the plane’s mutable substance into a roiling frenzy that eventually coalesces into a sishkanset. The creature maintains only a fraction of the mortal being’s personality, culled from its last moments of disorientation, isolation, and desperate search for comfort and safety. The creature finds itself inexorably drawn to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, where it seeks what its progenitor could not find in life.</p>
<p>Sishkansets most often dwell in sparsely populated frontier areas, border towns, and isolated homesteads. They are drawn toward landmarks that could have guided their progenitors to safety, twining their unnaturally tall frames around flagpoles, steeples, weather vanes, and other high places that allow an unfettered view of their surroundings. From such heights, they reach along the unnatural air currents they produce to sieve the minds of passersby.</p>
<p>Sishkansets fly against their assailants when aggressively confronted, wreathing themselves in restless currents and disrupting their opponents’ minds with mental assaults and disorienting blasts of icy wind. Sishkansets that are banished rather than physically destroyed develop a focused hatred of their banishers. Sishkansets lack any inherent means of traversing planar boundaries, but they wait, howling their wrath into the void, until an unwitting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> traveler creates a means by which the sishkansets can return to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> and pursue their targets.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Sishkansets are an infrequent menace and are often mistaken for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>. They enter a keening frenzy in response to attempts to banish them with positive energy or similar means-such displays of faith are a reminder of mortal experiences forever lost.</p>
<p>Objects bearing strong emotional impressions intrigue sishkansets. They hover over the psychically charged items, rambling about the memento’s past like an academy’s lecturer. Eventually, however, the creatures’ inability to interact with objects or incorporate the emotions they store rekindles their existential anguish.</p>

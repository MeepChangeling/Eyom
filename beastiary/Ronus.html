<h1>Ronus</h1>
<p class="description">A horrific creature steps forth, its body that of a great gray wolf and its head resembling a tremendous falcon covered with light brown feathers. It sits poised to pounce, gnashing its great black, razor-sharp beak. </p>

<p>When the sound of a falcon’s shriek and a wolf’s howl mixed together pierce the night air, chances are good that a solitary or pack of ronus are nearby and just about to strike. Turning and running only incites the pack for they know that no normal creature can outrun them (without the aid of magic).</p>
<p>Ronus packs build their lairs in hard to find areas and often use leaves, fallen trees, and broken tree limbs to camouflage the lair. Ronus are social creatures and a lair typically contains 1-4 packs. If young are present, there will be 2d4 of them; they are noncombatants.</p>

<h4><span id="Chill_Darkness_Su">Chill Darkness (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a skiurid can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> an object in order to cause it to radiate darkness in a 20 foot radius. This magical <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a> lowers the illumination by 1 step, as per the darkness spell, except that all creatures in the area take 1d6 points of cold damage and must succeed a DC 11 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Strength damage</a>. Creatures that do not take the cold damage are not affected by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Strength damage</a>. Creatures remaining in the aura do not take damage each round, but a creature that leaves the aura and enters it again takes damage when it reenters the aura. This chill darkness lasts for 1 minute, and interacts with light spells and light sources as per a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a> spell. A skiurid can create chill darkness three times per day, but must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> based.</p>
<h4><span id="Shadow_Jump_Su">Shadow Jump (Su)</span></h4>
<p>This small furry creature resembles a black squirrel the size of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cat">cat</a>. Its features are pointed and cruel, and its eye glow a sinister red.</p>
<p>Skiurids are malevolent squirrel-like beasts native to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Shadow-Plane">Plane of Shadow</a>. Their appearance often strikes novice adventurers as comical, but their attacks are anything but. A skiurid feeds by enveloping an area in a radius of freezing darknessâif any living creature takes damage from the aura, a kernel of shadow coalesces once the chill darkness dissipates. The size and nutritional value of this shadow nugget varies depending on how many creatures were injured, and so skiurids attempt to attack large groups whenever possible.</p>
<p>Creatures that make use of shadow magic often covet skiruids, both for their inherent abilities and the shadow nuggets they create. A shadow nugget can be used as a component in any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Necromancy">necromancy</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/shadow">shadow</a>) spell worth up to 250 gp, or can be used to shorten the duration of creating a magic item of these schools by 1 day. Only a single <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/shadow">shadow</a> nugget can be used per spell or magic item in this fashion, and the nugget is worth 250 gp to an interested buyer. A skiurid can also be taken as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-">familiar</a> by an evil spellcaster with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/improved-familiar">Improved Familiar</a> feat.</p>

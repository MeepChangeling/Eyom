<h1>Rakklethorn Toad</h1>
<p class="description">A cat-sized toad about 3-foot long with dozens of small needle-like thorns protruding from its back, hops forth. Its mottled brown and green skin glistens with a dull sheen, while its gray eyes study knowingly. </p>

<p>Relatives of poisonous toads, rakklethorns live in small packs in murky swamps. Rakklethorn toad packs are fiercely territorial, and battles between them are frequent. Occasionally, however, the rakklethorn toads enter a mating frenzy. Several packs merge and form a great swarm of noisy frogs that sweeps through the marshes like a wave. After a mating frenzy, females release hundreds of jelly-like eggs into the waters. Of all those eggs, only a very small fraction live long enough to hatch into tadpoles.</p>

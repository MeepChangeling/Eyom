<h4><span id="Disease_Scent_Ex"><a name="TOC-Disease-Scent-Ex-"></a>Disease Scent (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A bagiennik can smell a diseased creature as if using the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-">scent</a> ability. It can discern whether the diseased creature is the source of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> or merely a carrier; in the latter case, the bagiennik often seeks out the creature and attempts to purge its maladies.</p>
<h4><span id="Nasal_Burn_Su"><a name="TOC-Nasal-Burn-Su-"></a>Nasal Burn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A bagiennik’s nasal spray deals 1d6 points of fire damage to victims in subsequent rounds after it strikes a target (as per the burn universal monster ability), but it can also cure other maladies. Each round in which a victim takes damage from a bagiennik’s nasal spray, that victim can attempt a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. If the victim succeeds at this save, it heals 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">ability damage</a> to an ability score of its choice. If the result exceeds the DC by 5 or more, the victim can also attempt to remove a single <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> currently affecting her as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease">remove disease</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> 7th). If the damage from the bagiennik’s nasal burn is reduced or negated in any way, the victim can’t attempt this special <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save that round. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold rivers<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or gang (3â8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Bagienniks are small, amphibious fey that hide in tall reeds along rivers. They frequently dig into the silt beneath the pools of hot springs, where they take long naps in the warm and comforting waters and play pranks on foolish bathers who swim too close to the bagienniks’ hiding spots. Despite their capricious nature, the creatures are sought for their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> abilities. They delight in curing maladies and burning away infirmities with their caustic nasal spray.</p>
<p>A local bagiennik is considered a boon in many river towns. Citizens of such settlements often venture to the rivers with offerings, hoping to encourage the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> to stay close and heal their families. A bagiennik that finds a generous town might invite its extended family to settle in, testing the patience and largesse of its hosts.</p>

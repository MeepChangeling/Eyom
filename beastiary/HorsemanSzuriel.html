<h4><span id="Corrupted_Flames_Su">Corrupted Flames (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Channeling the fury and sorrow of those devoured within the boundaries of her domain, Szurielâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> corrupts the very essence of fire. Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like</a> ability or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> effect used by Szuriel that normally causes fire damage deals half of that damage as fire damage and half of it as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane</a> damage that is not subject to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance">energy resistance</a> or fire <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Eruptive_Arrival_Su">Eruptive Arrival (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When Szuriel uses any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Teleportation">teleportation</a> effect, she can create a pyroclastic detonation upon arrival as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>. This creates a blast of fire that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 30-foot radius (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 41 half). Szuriel can selectively omit creatures from this effect as she chooses, though she rarely does, enjoying the carnage and death of even her own allies. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Fury_of_the_Forsaken_Su">Fury of the Forsaken (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> once per day, Szuriel can instill all non-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> within a 60-foot radius of herself with a mind-twisting rage and lust for blood.</p>
<p>Affected creatures gain a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus">morale bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> and a â2 penalty to AC, and they are compelled to attack the nearest creature regardless of any previous allegiances. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 36 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save; otherwise, it persists as long as Szuriel remains within line of sight. When the effect ends, an affected creature becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued">fatigued</a>. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect and does not stack with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/#TOC-Rage-Ex-">barbarian rage</a>, the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/rage">rage</a> spell, or similar effects.

<h4><span id="Warmonger_Ex">Warmonger (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Szuriel is proficient with all weapons, and is treated as a 20th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighter</a> for the purpose of qualifying for feats that require a minimum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighter</a> level as a prerequisite.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or mounted (Szuriel and the Red Horse)<br/><b>Treasure</b> triple (Lamentation of the Faithless, other treasure)</p>
<p>At first glance, Szuriel seems a triumphant, angelic figure.</p>
<p>With her ivory skin, flowing golden hair, flawless and powerful body clothed in a coil of unsullied silk, and wings the blue-black of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/raven">raven</a>, she appears as a personification of glory from on highâa veritable goddess of war. Up close, however, this impression quickly fades. Mirrored and black as onyx, Szurielâs eyes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> constantly in crimson rivulets that run down her cheeks and fall to the ground.</p>
<p>When she deigns to smile, she reveals a mouth of jagged, razor-sharp fangs more befitting a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/shark/shark">shark</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a> than anything <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>. Szurielâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/greatsword">greatsword</a>, Lamentation of the Faithless, has been wielded by every Horseman of War dating back to the first, and it is said to be the corrupted blade of an ancient and forgotten empyreal lord.</p>
<p>The Horseman of War was once a fallen mortal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin">paladin</a>.</p>
<p>After she was excommunicated for her sins, she became a conquering general and finally a ruling empress who slaughtered the followers of her former faith. Her own death came not on the battlefield but by an assassinâs blade, yet this merely opened the greatest chapter in her conquests by propelling her into <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a> and, in time, the role of the Horseman of War.</p>
<p>Szuriel makes open mockery of all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">angels</a>, playing upon their thematic elements in her warped, destructive interactions with mortals, awing both the misguided and those fully cognizant of her nature. Her cults often portray her not as a paragon of destruction, conquest, and genocide, but as promising righteous victory, with the souls of fallen soldiers elevated to paradise regardless of what horrific crimes they commit.</p>
<p>Szurielâs armies represent the largest and most strictly organized force in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>, but at any given moment, fully half of the Horsemanâs armies are scattered throughout the planes in mercenary service to various Abyssal lords, archdevils, and whatever other forces purchase their services. Most times, that price is steep, as Szuriel demands living mortals or souls, or the right to consume those who fall upon the field of battle. When her armies march upon the mortal plane, they honor their commitments just long enough to make their âalliesâ complacent before engaging in systematic genocide.</p>
<h3><span id="Szuriels_Cult">Szurielâs Cult</span></h3>
<p>Szuriel is worshiped by those associated with every facet of war, including everything leading up to it and arising in its bloody wake. Arms dealers, looters, mercenaries, soldiers, and warlords worship the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">Angel</a> of Desolation.</p>
<p>Szuriel also holds the allegiance of a significant number of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Daemon">daemon</a>-worshiping and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Daemon">daemon</a>-created <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/Urdefhan">urdefhan</a> race. The Seraph of Devastation is served by her deacon race of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/purrodaemon">purrodaemons</a> as well as carrion eaters, obcisidaemons, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> soldiers, war beasts, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/warsworn">warsworn</a>. Szurielâs unholy symbol is a pale hand and black sword, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/greatsword">greatsword</a> is her favored weapon. She grants access to the domains of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil">Evil</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fire">Fire</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>, and War, and to the subdomains of Blood, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Daemon">Daemon</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ferocity-Ex-">Ferocity</a>, and Tactics.</p>

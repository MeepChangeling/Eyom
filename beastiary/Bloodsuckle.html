<h1>Bloodsuckle</h1>
<p class="description">This is a nightmarish plant consisting of a bulbous root and several vine-like tendrils, each ending in hollow, needle-like points. Woody limbs as thick as a humanâs leg sprout from the trunk. Its leaves are a vile greenish color, and constantly drip a sticky, foul-smelling sap</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Blood-Drain-Ex-"></a>Blood Drain (Ex)</h4>
<p>A bloodsuckle that grapples a foe can drain blood, dealing 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> each round that the hold is maintained. Once it has dealt 8 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>, it releases victim so it can use it again later as a food source. Bloodsuckles never kill those they have transformed into hosts unless they are extremely hungry.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Create-Host-Ex-"></a>Create Host (Ex)</h4>
<p>A bloodsuckle that strikes a living target with a tendril injects a special <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/sap">sap</a> into the victim that requires a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save, or the victim is transformed into a host. This acts as a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-monster">dominate monster</a> spell (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> 8th) with no limit on its duration. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">Immunity</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance">resistance</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> applies normally to this sap. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> based.</p>
<p>A victim that becomes a host returns to the plant whenever it calls. It is normally used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack may be summoned for defense. A host with an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> (such as attacking allies) is allowed another <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save with a +4 bonus to break the bloodsuckleâs control.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Host-Sense-Ex-"></a>Host Sense (Ex)</h4>
<p>A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any hosts within 100 feet.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Seed-Ex-"></a>Seed (Ex)</h4>
<p>Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it implants in a hostâs body. The host wanders off and 1d4 days later, the seed breaks open growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>. When its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> reaches 0, the host dies and a new bloodsuckle erupts from the corpse and takes root. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease">remove disease</a> spell destroys the seedling.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Summon-Host-Ex-"></a>Summon Host (Ex)</h4>
<p>As <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, a bloodsuckle can generate a high-pitched whine that only its hosts can hear. A host that hears this call proceeds immediately at its highest rate of speed and in the most direct route toward the plant. The whine can be heard by a host within 2 miles of the bloodsuckle. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or cadre (bloodsuckle plus 4â7 hosts)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> 50% standard</p>
<p>Bloodsuckles are semi-intelligent and immobile plants that gain nourishment from the blood of living creatures. Unlike other carnivorous plants, the bloodsuckle maintains a group of living hosts that it gorges itself on. Bloodsuckles are found in forests, swamps, and rolling hills in climates where the temperate is mild. They are never found in cold climates, but a variety of this plant is thought to exist in warmer regions.</p>
<p>When a bloodsuckle detects movement within 30 feet, it sends out its long, vine-like tendrils towards the disturbance. If the tendril strikes a living target, it injects sap into the victim which brings it under the plantâs control. A bloodsuckle can automatically detect the presence of one of its hosts within 30 feet, and does not attack it. Rather, it lets the host draw close so it can embrace it with its tendrils and consume its blood.</p>
<p>Creatures that are not hosts of the bloodsuckle that come within 10 feet are attacked by its woody limbs. </p>

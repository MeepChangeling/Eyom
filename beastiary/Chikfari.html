<p class="description">This bizarre creature resembles a grasshopper but is far, far larger and its hindquarters look much more like that of a reptile rather than an insect.</p>

<h4><span id="Devastating_Kick_Ex">Devastating Kick (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A chikfariâs massive rear legs are incredibly powerful (dealing +1 Â½ its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier in damage and having a critical range of x3). Whenever a chikfari hits a target of its size or smaller with a devastating kick attack it may make a free <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush">bull rush</a> attempt to knock the target away, though the chikfari cannot move with the target if it does.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or clutch (5-10)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Though chikfari (or âkicking insectsâ) are borderline intelligent creatures in their own right, they remain little more than dangerous beasts due to their short lifespan of barely 10 years. As a result they often build nests near other intelligent subterranean creatures, where they serve as mounts in exchange for foodâand often eventually become food themselves well before their natural lifespan.</p>
<p>When hatched, an immature chikfari is nearly fully developed.</p>
<p>They are smaller than their fully grown counterparts, more closely matching a mule in size compared to a full horse. A fully grown chikfari stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder, is approximately 12 feet long, and weighs between 1,200 and 1,400 pounds.</p>
<p>Chickfari Subspecies Other species of chikfari have been identified deep in the underworld. Subterranean chikfari are typically much more vicious than the common surface breeds, though at a glance they can only be identified by coloration. Several of these varieties are known to be able to fly, and some possess more directly threatening abilities (like the zelfariâs ability to shoot the spines off of its legs and to attack its enemies).</p>

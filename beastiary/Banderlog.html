<p>The banderlog is a somewhat intelligent baboon-like primate that makes its home in warm forests and jungles. Though it appears as a larger version of the common baboon, it does not keep company with or associate with normal baboons. Banderlogsâ intelligence allows them to form small tribal communities for protection and companionship. The leader of such a community is usually the largest and strongest banderlog of the tribe. It is not uncommon to find more than one tribe in the same area. Banderlogs generally coexist quite well with other banderlog tribes, though if food becomes scarce, they attempt to drive off all other tribes in the area.</p>
<p>Banderlogs sustain themselves on a diet of fruits and nuts, with coconuts being their favorite food. Though omnivorous, they rarely eat meat of any sort. The typical banderlog stands just over 4-feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. Banderlogs are non-aggressive unless they are threatened. They prefer to attack opponents from a distance using small rocks or coconuts to hit their foes. Should they be engaged in melee, they attack using a vicious bite.</p>

<h1>Mortic, Lifeleecher</h1>
<p class="description">The pallid flesh of this ferocious, orc-like creature is covered in scars and burns. Its muscles are thick and corded, and its hatefilled eyes seem to reflect death wherever they stare.</p>

<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su">Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> creature slain by a morticâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/leech">leech</a> life special ability becomes a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/wight">wight</a> in 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p>Wights spawned by a lifeleecher mortic have penalties like true <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/wight">wight</a> spawn, and they are under the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/command">command</a> of the mortic who created them for a period of 24 hours, after which they collapse to the ground, devoid of any animating power, and become mundane corpses. These spawn do not have any of the abilities they had in life.</p>
<h4><span id="Leech_Life_Su">Leech Life (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a> after a successful bite attack, a lifeleecher mortic can siphon a portion of its targetâs life energy into itself. This functions as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain">energy drain</a> universal monster rule.</p>
<p>If the mortic drains a level in this way, the mortic gains the benefits of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> spell (CL 8th).</p>
<h4><span id="Mortic_Ferocity_Su">Mortic Ferocity (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A lifeleecher mortic has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ferocity-Ex-">ferocity</a>, as the universal monster rule. However, when the lifeleecher mortic falls below 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it does not lose any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> per round and it is not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a>. A lifeleecher mortic still dies when it reaches a negative number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> score. Lifeleecher mortics fighting in this state are driven by instinct and default to attacking with their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a>, bolstered by their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/leech">leech</a> life and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/death-knell">death knell</a> abilities. Using manufactured weapons or using any other tactics or abilities requires the lifeleecher mortic to succeed at a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw to suppress its instincts.</p>
<h4><span id="Resurrection_Vulnerability_Su">Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead">raise dead</a> or similar spell cast on a lifeleecher mortic staggers it for 1d4 rounds unless the mortic succeeds at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save against the casterâs saving throw DC for that spell. Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. When <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> due to such an effect, a lifeleecher mortic cannot use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/leech">leech</a> life special ability and its mortic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ferocity-Ex-">ferocity</a> ability is suppressed. If the lifeleecher mortic is reduced to fewer than 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> while affected by a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead">raise dead</a> effect, it immediately gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> condition and loses 1 hit point per round.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate hills, mountains, or underground<br/>
<b>Organization</b> solitary or gang (2â4)<br/>
<b>Treasure</b> standard (breastplate, javelins [4], mwk <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/falchion">falchion</a>, other treasure)</p>
<p>Much like some of their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> kin, lifeleecher mortics often <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> themselves in ritual scarring, brands, and auspicious tattoos. However, a lifeleecher morticâs skin is an ashen gray color, signaling their flirtation with death. Of all their markings, lifeleecher mortics most celebrate their death scar: the site of a mortal wound that would have felled creatures far more resilient than an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a>, yet that failed to slay the lifeleecher mortic, instead unleashing their mortic heritage.</p>
<p>Lifeleecher mortics are roughly 6 feet tall and weigh about 230 pounds.</p>
<p>A lifeleecher morticâs elongated nails resemble a raptorâs talons, with razor tusks jutting upward from their lower lip, ending just below their lifeless eyes. Lifeleecher mortics are not born with their mortic abilities; rather, these powers manifest upon a morticâs initial brush with death. As the lifeleecher mortic receives what should be a fatal blow, their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ferocity-Ex-">ferocity</a> triggers something deep within that releases their mortic powers.</p>
<p>Upon receiving any killing blow, the lifeleecherâs mortic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ferocity-Ex-">ferocity</a> activates. The mortic enters a feral, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/furious" style="font-style:italic;">furious</a> state that drives them on, allowing them to continue fighting where other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>, even <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orc">orcs</a>, would fall. As they enters this trance, they forgo weapons and other tools, instead ravaging their opponents with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a>, especially their savage, life-leeching maw. The fact that lifeleechers consume their foesâ life energy with their maws leads many of them to gravitate toward cannibalism in general, and even those who do not partake of cannibalism tend to prefer their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Meat">meat</a> fresh and raw.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Lifeleecher mortics enjoy an almost celebrity <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/status">status</a> in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> settlements, both feared and revered for their strange ability to shrug off death blows. In a society where might makes right, death-defying lifeleecher mortics quickly climb their tribal hierarchies as their ability to defeat their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> cousins proves their strength and worthiness to rule. In other cases, powerful mortics find themselves quickly sold off to large gladiatorial stables in Belkzen and the Lands of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/linnorm">Linnorm</a> Kings or the savage, tusk-lined fighting pits within the Realm of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant-mammoth">Mammoth</a> Lords. Many managers enjoy having a lifeleecher mortic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-heroes/champion">champion</a> in these blood-soaked arenas, as the morticsâ prolonged fights and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> displays both wow and terrify crowds in a gruesome spectacle often talked about for several seasons after the bout itself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, lifeleechersâ penchant for animating those they defeat into <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/wight">wights</a>, even temporarily, stirs many <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> superstitions regarding death and magic. Tribes whisper insults depicting the lifeleechers as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures themselves or suggest that they are possessed by fiends. Of course, most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orc">orcs</a> would never say such things to a lifeleecher morticâs face; they are far more likely to grovel at the lifeleecherâs feet to garner favor from their much stronger kin.</p>
<p>Many soothsayers, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman">shamans</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle">oracles</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch">witches</a> believe lifeleecher mortics hold the spirits of fallen <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> heroes killed before they fulfilled their destiny, and it is this power that drives these nigh-indestructible warriors. When a lifeleecher mortic takes a mate, it prefers others of its kind; however, due to their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> heritage, these mortics can also breed with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orc">orcs</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>, and their often-high <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/status">status</a> gives them plenty of opportunity to do so. A morticâs offspring, whether <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc">half-orc</a>, all have potential to manifest as lifeleecher mortics when their racial <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ferocity-Ex-">ferocity</a> triggers. Unfortunately, tribes all too often attempt to hasten this phenomenon, risking the lives of young <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orc">orcs</a> to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spark">spark</a> this heritage, and it is more likely for a young <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> with a lifeleecher mortic parent to die than for the childâs mortic abilities to be unleashed.</p>
<p>Lifeleecher mortics who live apart from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> settlements fare far worse than their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc">half-orc</a> cousins in similar communities. Something about their mannerisms, especially their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> eyes, is off-putting to non-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orc">orcs</a>. Add to that their proclivity for cannibalism, and lifeleecher mortics find they do not assimilate well outside of gladiatorial pens or spectacle sideshows, and the public quickly drives them out into the wild when they discover the lifeleecher morticâs questionable heritage and unsavory diet. This suits most lifeleecher mortics just fine, as outside of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc">orc</a> lands they gravitate towards loner lifestyles as explorers, big-game <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/hunter">hunters</a>, and practitioners of guerrilla warfare.</p>

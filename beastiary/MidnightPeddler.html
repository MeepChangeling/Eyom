<h1>Midnight Peddler</h1>
<p class="description">This creature appears as a normal human, cloaked in a long gray hooded robe. A long protruding, sharp jaw can be seen under the hood. He moves with a shuffling gait, pushing a wooden cart that squeaks as it rolls along. </p>

<p>The midnight peddler wanders city streets and is normally only encountered on fog-covered nights. He is first detected by the audible squeaking of the cart he pushes, the sound growing louder as he draws closer. The sound can be heard at a range of 300 feet with a successful DC 12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check. The midnight peddler moves with a slow gait as he pushes his wooden cart. The contents of his cart vary each time he visits the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, but at any given time, he has available any item listed in the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment">Equipment section</a> with a value of 50 gp or less.</p>
<p>The midnight peddler shuns combat. If forced into battle, he uses his death chill ability at first opportunity and then plane shifts away.</p>

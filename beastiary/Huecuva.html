<p>During the day, a huecuva is cloaked in an illusion that makes it look, sound, and feel like the living creature it once was. This effect functions similarly to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disguise-self">disguise self</a>âif a creature interacts directly with a huecuva, it can attempt a DC 12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to see through the illusion. Regardless, the huecuva’s scent never changesâit always exudes a faint <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Stench-Ex-">stench</a> of grave dust and decay. Creatures with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-">scent</a> ability receive a +4 bonus on any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw made to see through this illusion. At night (regardless of whether the huecuva itself knows night has fallen) this illusion fades and reveals the creature for what it truly is. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>*Note</b>: <i>The Disease ability shown here indicates that filth fever deals <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dex</a> and Str damage but filth fever normally deals <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dex</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> damage (not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dex</a> and Str damage).

<p>Huecuvas are the risen corpses of heretical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">clerics</a> who blasphemed and renounced their deities before meeting death. In unlife, they hate and seek to destroy those pious souls who keep their vows. Although easily mistaken for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombies</a> or even <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeletons</a>, huecuvas have a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spark">spark</a> of intelligence that makes them cunning and deceptive foes. During daylight hours, a huecuva becomes shrouded in an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> that causes it to appear as it did in lifeâat these times, a huecuva might seek to infiltrate society to dwell among those it hates. When night falls, it emerges to seek out its prey. Fortunately for the living, the typical huecuva has only fragments of intellect remaining, so it is usually not long before the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature makes an error of judgment or simply reveals itself for the monster it is.</p>
<p>Most huecuvas remember little of their former lives except for the blasphemies that led them to their cursed fates. They often find themselves drawn to the ruins of old temples, where they rage against or seek hopeless absolution from the deities who so afflicted them. Huecuvas sometimes work in concert with other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures that share the same area.</p>
<p>While most huecuvas arise when a god rejects a heretic priest’s soul, forcing the slain to rise as horrible <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, a huecuva can also be created with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-undead">create undead</a>. The caster must be at least 11th level, and the body to be transformed must have been an evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a> in life. The spell can be used to create a huecuva using the body of a nonevil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a>, but doing so requires a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check. Creating a huecuva in this way is considered to be one of the most heinous things that can be done to a cleric that has passed away. The faithless aura of huecuvas created from the bodies of good clerics in this way grants a +4 profane bonus on Will saves to resist channeled energy and any effects based off that ability.</p>

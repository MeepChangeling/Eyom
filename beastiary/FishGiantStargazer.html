<p>A stargazer can open its giant mouth in a fraction of a second, creating a vortex that draws a target into its maw. When underwater, a stargazer gains 5 additional feet of reach with its bite attack and a +2 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> checks to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>.</p>

<p>A stargazer has two large venomous spines situated behind its head. The stargazer reacts swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any creature that attempts to harm it. Each time a creature attacks a stargazer with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapon</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a>, or weapon attack that doesnât have reach, it must succeed at a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or be hit by one of these spines. Each time a creature is hit by a spine, it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the stargazerâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. A creature that grapples a stargazer is automatically hit by these spines. The save DC to avoid the spines is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>

<p>A giant stargazer is an ambush predator with a speckled, flattened body that hunts by burying itself in the sand, leaving just its eyes and mouth uncovered. A typical giant stargazer is 6 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.</p>

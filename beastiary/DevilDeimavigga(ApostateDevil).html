<h1>Devil, Deimavigga (Apostate Devil)</h1>
<p class="description">Armored in the ceremonial garb of some grim knight, this figure stands unnaturally still, though the intricate metalwork patterns of its sculpted mantle writhe and shift as if alive. Claws the length of longswords extend from its armored fingers in razor-sharp fans, and no head or helm rests upon its ironclad shoulders. Instead, there hovers only a plain mask, an unnatural facade devoid of all empathy, emotion, or mercy.</p>

<h4><span id="Boundless_Reach_Su"><a name="TOC-Boundless-Reach-Su-"></a>Boundless Reach (Su)</span></h4>
<h4><span id="Evangelization_Su"><a name="TOC-Evangelization-Su-"></a>Evangelization (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The words of deimaviggas are poison to the mind. Every round a deimavigga speaks (a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>), all non-devils with an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score of 3 or higher within 30 feet must make a DC 28 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become vulnerable to its blasphemous discourse. The DC of this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save increases by +1 for each consecutive round a creature has listened to the same deimavigga speak.</p>
<p>Creatures must be listening to a deimavigga to be affected by its oration. Deafened creatures and those in combatâeither with the deimavigga or other creaturesâare not considered to be listening. Victims cannot simply declare they are not listening without taking steps to impede their hearing. Upon failing this save, a victim can be affected by the heretical power of a deimaviggaâs words.</p>
<p>The devil may use its speech to affect a listener in ways that mimic any of the following spells:</p>
<p><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/calm-emotions">calm emotions</a> (DC 21), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-monster">charm monster</a> (DC 23), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/command">command</a> (DC 20), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">confusion</a> (DC 23), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/crushing-despair">crushing despair</a> (DC 23), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/deep-slumber">deep slumber</a> (DC 22), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/enthrall">enthrall</a> (DC 21), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/modify-memory">modify memory</a> (DC 23), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/rage">rage</a> (DC 22), or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a> (DC 22).</p>
<p>Victims still receive saving throws against these spell effects, but if they fail their saves they are not aware the devil is working its power upon them. A deimavigga can affect multiple victims with different spell effects in the same round. A creature that makes its save against this ability is immune to that particular devilâs evangelization for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The base save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Indomitable_Oration_Su"><a name="TOC-Indomitable-Oration-Su-"></a>Indomitable Oration (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A deimaviggaâs speech is always perfectly clear and cannot be silenced or warped. In areas of incredible noise, through water or airless voids, even in areas of magical <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silence">silence</a>, these devilâs voices can still be heard normally. All beings understand deimaviggas, as if these devils constantly spoke in all tongues at once.</p>
<h4><span id="Malleable_Form_Su"><a name="TOC-Malleable-Form-Su-"></a>Malleable Form (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A deimavigga has complete control over its physical form, and if transformed into another shape against its will, it can revert to its own form as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Ohrwurm_Ex"><a name="TOC-Ohrwurm-Ex-"></a>Ohrwurm (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, three times per day, a deimavigga can whisper a fundamental and terrifying multiversal truth to one creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 28 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or have the devilâs words take root in its psyche. Outsiders and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Elemental">elementals</a> have a +2 bonus on their saves to resist this ability. Initially, the deimaviggaâs words seem to have no effect. Anytime the victim tries to rest, though, he must make an additional DC 28 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be affected as per the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/nightmare">nightmare</a> (even if the victim doesnât technically sleep).</p>
<p>After a night of suffering vivid dreams and wrestling with the devilâs words, the victim must make yet another DC 28 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or have its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> shift one step toward lawful evil. Only by unlearning what the deimavigga told it can a victim be free of this effect, requiring a spell such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle">miracle</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/modify-memory">modify memory</a>, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Wisdom_Drain_Su"><a name="TOC-Wisdom-Drain-Su-"></a>Wisdom Drain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A deimavigga <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">drains</a> 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> each time it hits with its claw attack. (A deimavigga does not heal any damage when it uses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">drain</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> Hell <br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary <br/> <b>Treasure</b> double ( <i>+5 shadow full plate</i>, other treasure) </p>
<p><b>Habitat &amp; Society</b></p>
<p>Deimaviggas prefer to spend their time upon the Material plane, swaying the weak and corruptible souls of mortals. There they seek out either vast mortal cities, where their heresy might reach many ears, or small communities where the isolated might fall to their blasphemous philosophizing. When in Hell, though, they linger in Caina, tormenting the souls of those trapped upon its lonely islands, developing and testing complicated and often confusing arguments. Preferring to operate alone, these poison-tongued devils rarely work with others of their kind, even though their status as greater devils affords them great control over their lesser brethren. They find their arguments benefit from simplicity, their endeavors complicated by even the most obedient minions. Pit fiends and infernal dukes sometimes utilize deimaviggas as spies and spreaders of dissension and confusion, though even among devilkind these enigmatic fiends are considered strange and unnerving.</p>

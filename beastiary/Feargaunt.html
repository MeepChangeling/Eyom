<p>A number of times per day equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier, a feargaunt can <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">teleport</a> to a square adjacent to a creature that is still <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> from the feargaunt’s nightmare aura or damaged by its tormenting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>. This ability functions as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">greater teleport</a>. This ability functions only if the feargaunt and the creature are both in the Dimension of Dreams.</p>
<h4><span id="Nightmare_Aura_Su"><a name="TOC-Nightmare-Aura-Su-"></a>Nightmare Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A feargaunt is cloaked in a 60-foot-radius aura of fear, which manifests as darkened shadows, subtle rot, and skewed perspective. The first time a creature ends its turn within the aura, it must succeed at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for as long as it stays within the aura and for 1d4 rounds thereafter.</p>
<p>Creatures within the aura suffering from any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect automatically fail <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> checks to attempt impossible feats in a dreamscape. The feargaunt can suppress or reactivate this aura as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect.</p>
<p>The DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Prideful_Defense_Su"><a name="TOC-Prideful-Defense-Su-"></a>Prideful Defense (Su)</span></h4>

<h4><span id="Tormenting_Touch_Su"><a name="TOC-Tormenting-Touch-Su-"></a>Tormenting Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A feargaunt’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> is an incorporeal touch attack that deals 6d6 points of damage and bypasses <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>. A creature that is suffering from a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect and is struck by the feargaunt’s tormenting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> also takes 1d2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage. This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage can be stopped as normal, but also stops when the subject is no longer suffering from a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Dimension of Dreams)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Certain vivid nightmares endure beyond the sleeper’s awakening, drawing substance from planar flotsam and deriving purpose from their creators’ deepest fears. Shifting their form from moment to moment, these malicious creatures range the Dimension of Dreams, ambushing prey with soul-weakening strikes. Their presence turns dream elements that might otherwise be only frightening into agonizing experiences that can kill their victims. Feargaunts often allow victims to believe they have escaped, only to attack anew from an unexpected direction. The Dimension of Dreams is their home territory, and a feargaunt uses its knowledge of this realm to ensure that no matter how fast or how far victims flee, they can never truly leave the feargaunt behind.</p>
<p>Anywhere a feargaunt steps takes on a darker, more frightening cast. Shadows become impenetrable hiding places for things that lurk out of sight, familiar locations take on ominous twists that lead those who thought they knew their way astray, and comforting faces become masks for monstrous, sadistic enemies. The terror the feargaunt inspires eats away at the mental stability of its victims, ensuring that they can’t navigate dreamscapes without tripping themselves up and letting their own imaginations hamper them.</p>

<h1>Symbiont, Environmental Suit</h1>
<p class="description">This creature is a tall, bark-like humanoid covered with dozens of lashing vines baring tiny, hooked barbs. A vertical mouth at the front of its headless body is surrounded by a writhing ring of brightly-colored cilia.</p>

<p>Whenever an environmental armor symbiont deals maximum damage with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a> ability, it also deals 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage as hundreds of small vines flay the target. Additionally, it can forgo dealing constrict damage in a round and instead deal 2 points of bleed damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Environmental_Protection_Ex">Environmental Protection (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An environmental suit symbiont protects the host from extreme temperature conditions (as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/endure-elements">endure elements</a>) as well as changes in pressure. The symbiont also provides continuous oxygen as long as there is sunlight for photosynthesis; otherwise it only contains an oxygen supply up to 24 hours. It takes the symbiont 1 hour to recharge its oxygen supply through photosynthesis. The suit automatically repairs rips and tears as they occur unless the symbiont is reduced to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> or less.</p>
<h4><span id="Natural_Armor_Ex">Natural Armor (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When bonded, an environmental suit symbiont grants the host a +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a>.</p>

<p>An environmental suit symbiont attaches its roots to the hostâs chest when bonded. Thousands of vines emanate from a long central stem encasing the hostâs body, while membranous leaves cover the eyes, allowing the host to see. These vines secrete a specialized fluid to temporarily bind themselves together, making the suit airtight. The vines are conditioned to resist both extreme heat and cold, as well as protect the wearer from pressure changes due to different gravities.</p>
<p>The environmental armor symbiont takes a rough, stocky humanoid form when unbonded, and stands approximately 7 feet tall. The vines from its central stem form two legs and arms, though it has no discernible âhead.â Its primary mode of combat is to engage and grapple its opponent while hundreds of small, hard vines and minute thorns constantly tear at held creatures, bleeding them dry. A common myth states the environmental armor symbiont grows stronger by soaking up the blood of its victims, though this is not true.</p>

<p>Forgotten ones try to avoid combat with anything larger than themselves-they are well aware of their own limitations. If hard pressed or ordered into combat by a greater fey creature to defend their forest, forgotten ones will fight with courage not often attributed to creatures of such small size.</p>

<p>Forgotten Ones are skilled in the use of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Forgotten ones use a mixture of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/bees-and-wasps/bee-giant">bee</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/spider">spider</a> venom on their spears that causes severe itching and soreness.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Forgetful-Presence-Su-"></a>Forgetful Presence (Su)</h4>
<p>Three times per day, a forgotten one can cause any creature within 20 feet of it to forget an encounter with it as per a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/modify-memory">modify memory</a> spell with the restriction that it can only remove memories specifically dealing with the forgotten one. Opponents that succeed on a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save avoid the effects. Opponents that make the save are immune to the forgetful presence of that forgotten one for 24 hours. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<p>Forgotten ones are a sprite race related to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/pixie">pixies</a>. These wee folk are natural spies and trackers, and are routinely employed by powerful forest-guarding fey creatures such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magical-beasts/unicorn">unicorns</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryads</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/nymph">nymphs</a>. It is not uncommon for travelers in a fey forest to be followed by scores of forgotten ones, all moving unnoticed through the treetops as quickly and quietly as squirrels. While some forgotten ones keep track of the interlopers, others send messages back and forth to alert more powerful fey guardians to the presence of outsiders.</p>
<p>A forgotten one is about a foot tall with pointed ears, slanted eyes, and long, nimble limbs. Most forgotten ones weave twigs and leaves into their hair for decoration and to help conceal themselves in the treetops. Ranger are druids are especially fond of the forgotten ones, and often use them as intermediaries between themselves and the greater Fey guardians of the forest.</p>

<p>Giant yellowjackets attack by biting their foes. Though it has a poisonous stinger, it usually conducts combat with its bite attack, unless threatened by or confronting a particularly powerful opponent. In such cases, the giant yellowjacket brings its stinger to bear and repeatedly stings its foes until they are dead. If attacked, a giant yellowjacket releases a pheromone that agitates all others of its kind, making them deadlier and more aggressive.</p>

<p>Giant yellowjackets are often mistakenly called giant hornets. They can be distinguished from giant hornets by the yellow markings on their thorax and abdomen. Giant yellowjackets spend their days suckling nectar from flowers and fruit juices from plants. When hunting for food to feed the young, they seek out sources of carrion or animal tissue. Living prey is attacked and stung to death and then cut into pieces by the giant yellowjacket’s sharp mandibles and carried piece by piece back to the nest.</p>
<p>Giant yellowjackets generally build their nests high above ground in rocky outcroppings or forested areas. Some giant yellowjackets prefer to build their nests underground, constructing them in abandoned giant snake holes.</p>
<p>Giant yellowjackets are 8 feet long with alternating bands of black and yellow on their thorax and abdomen. Workers generally have thicker black bands than the queen or soldiers. The yellowjacket’s stinger is slightly curved and barbed and their mandibles are well-formed and developed, allowing them to chew their food.</p>

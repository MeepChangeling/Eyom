<h4><span id="Claw_Bore_Ex">Claw Bore (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>On a successful claw attack, the grappling claw symbiont may immediately attempt to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> its target.</p>
<p>The grappling claw symbiont gains a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> when <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> and maintaining a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> when using this ability. On each subsequent round that the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> claw symbiont remains grappled with a creature, its claw bores deeper into creatureâs flesh, seeking vital organs and dealing 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Strength damage</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Symbiont_Whip_Ex">Symbiont Whip (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The grappling claw symbiont can project numerous, intertwined vines which act as a masterwork <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/whip">whip</a>, and which the host can use as if possessing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/exotic-weapon-proficiency-combat/">Exotic Weapon Proficiency</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/whip">whip</a>) feat. In addition, the host can attempt to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> creatures with the whip up to 10 ft. away using the grappling clawâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus">CMB</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> scores or the hostâs, whichever are higher. On a successful attack, the host does not gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition but cannot take any actions with the limb the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> claw is attached to.</p>
<p>Grappled creatures may attack the symbiont as if it were in their reach.</p>
<h4><span id="Symbiont_Grappler_Ex">Symbiont Grappler (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Dozens of vines unwind, springing from the symbiontâs root to reach for handholds, granting the host a 30 ft. climb speed. Additionally, the grappling claw symbiont can wrap itself around a fixed object up to 15 ft. away as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Hook-Grappling">grappling hook</a>.</p>

<p>A grappling claw symbiont attaches to its hostâs wrist, encircling the hand in a series of strong, yet flexible vines. When commanded, the vines unravel with the ability to stretch up to 15 feet away. Very fine leaves all along the vines assist them in grappling and hooking around objects.</p>
<p>Unbonded, a grappling claw symbiont appears as a tiny mass of coiled vines. Despite its very small size, the flexible nature of its vines allows them to stretch in order to attack enemies. The ends of the vine are designed to harden as a result of its grappling capabilities, allowing the symbiont to slash at opponents. The grappling claw symbiont seeks to grapple prey and use its hardened vines to bore into the target, much like a drill.</p>

<h4><span id="Disturbing_Vocalizations_Su">Disturbing Vocalizations (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A genghryl can emit different sounds from its lure tentacles, allowing it to mimic the barks, howls, shrieks, yips, and other noises common among <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing mammals. Additionally, once per round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, it can also use one of its tentacles to target a creature with one of two sounds, imposing either the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> condition for 1d6 rounds unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same genghrylâs disturbing vocalizations for 24 hours. This is a sonic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Lure_Tentacles_Ex">Lure Tentacles (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A genghryl has a number of specialized tentacles equal to half its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. It uses these tentacles to animate and manipulate the corpses of Small or smaller creatures and to emit its disturbing vocalizations.</p>
<p>A genghryl typically uses these tentacles to maintain the illusion that a colony of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a> is alive and well, drawing in larger, predatory <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>. When it uses <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>â corpses in this way, it gains a +8 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> checks (in addition to its normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>).</p>
<p>Although the genghryl can animate Small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> in this manner, it does not gain the additional bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> checks when doing so. Severing a lure tentacle requires a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting the tentacle. A lure tentacle is considered a separate weapon with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 0 and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> equal to the genghrylâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (typically 16 hp). To sever a tentacle, an opponent must deal enough damage to reduce the tentacleâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> to 0 or fewer. Severing a tentacle deals an amount of damage to the genghrylâs body equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. A genghryl with no remaining lure tentacles canât use its disturbing vocalizations.</p>
<h4><span id="Sinkhole_Ex">Sinkhole (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A genghryl can cause an adjacent area of the ground above it (up to a 10-foot-by-10-foot square) to collapse, dropping any creatures in the affected squares into a 10-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save, as though they had been subjected to the effects of a pit <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps">trap</a>. The genghryl waits adjacent to the bottom of the pit and can immediately make a single melee attack against the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a> AC of one creature that fell in. A creature that fails the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save by 5 or more also falls <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any plains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Genghryls are subterranean, wormlike creatures that use specialized tentacles to lure and weaken their prey.</p>
<p>Genghryls are to verdant lands what seaweed sirens are to shipping lanes or wolves-in-sheepâs-clothing are to plentiful woodlandsâa menace.</p>
<p>A genghrylâs mottled, pinkish-brown body is about 3 feet wide at the front and tapers down to its tail, resembling a hideous segmented worm. Its head consists of a tooth-lined opening behind a sharp beak, which is surrounded by four powerful tentacles and three black eyes spaced evenly around it. A number of longer, thinner tentacles sprout from the segment just behind the genghrylâs head. The older and larger the genghryl, the more tentacles it has.</p>
<p>An adult genghryl weighs approximately 300 pounds.</p>
<p>Genghryls live below ground and, although they prefer temperate or warm climates, can survive nearly anywhere that isnât flooded, frozen, or scalding. Their adaptations make them suited to regions where they can take over colonies of small, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing mammals like groundhogs, meerkats, prairie dogs, and similar prey animals.</p>
<p>When a genghryl moves into an area, it uses its tentacles to subdue and then strangle a colony of mammals.</p>
<p>Instead of eating these creatures, the genghryl inserts each of its lure tentacles into one of the corpses and animates it. The genghryl manipulates these corpses so it appears the mound is inhabited by active but careless creatures. It then hollows out the ground beneath the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>, weakening key points, and waits for a predatory animalâlike a badger, fox, or something largerâto notice the potential prey.</p>
<p>When its prey gets close enough to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>, either to capture an easy meal or to investigate the animalsâ strange behavior, the genghryl collapses the ground beneath its victim. The victim falls into the pit, where the genghryl waits to grab it. If an approaching creature is too strong or dangerous, the genghryl can emit shrieking noises from its lure tentacles to either weaken or frighten away the threat.</p>
<p>A genghrylâs lure tentacles donât keep the dead animals from decaying, so it must eventually abandon a depleted den and seek out fresh lures. The number of animals a genghryl can manipulate is limited to the number of lure tentacles it has. Although genghryls typically use Tiny animals, they can manipulate creatures as large as humanoids. The genghrylâs primitive intelligence might even allow it to approximate some basic humanoid behaviors. A massive genghryl living beneath a lonely village could pose a horrifying threat to weary travelers.</p>
<p>Genghryls require large hunting areas and are fiercely territorial. They are hermaphroditic, like earthworms, and mating is the only reason two genghryls will tolerate one otherâs presence. After mating, each genghryl lays a clutch of slime-covered eggs beneath a small, active <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> on the edge of its territory. The first genghryl to hatch eats the other eggs, feeding on its siblings to gain strength, then attacks the nearby <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> and begins its own predation.</p>

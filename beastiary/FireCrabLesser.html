<h1>Fire Crab, Lesser</h1>
<p class="description">A dog-sized crab with a square-shaped reddish-brown carapace covered with dark red and yellow markings scuttles forth, pincers raised. Tiny flames lick its body, erupting at irregular intervals from its underbelly. Its eyes are perched on the end of two large eyestalks that protrude from the center of the carapace.</p>

<p>Fire crabs are highly territorial and defend their lair with great ferocity. Normally non-aggressive creatures, if their lair is threatened, they fight to the death. Against weaker prey, fire crabs usually just slash with their claws. Stronger foes are grabbed and squeezed by the fire crab. Once they grab an opponent, they hold on, allowing their fires to engulf the foe.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Heat-Ex-"></a>Heat (Ex)</h4>
<p>The body of a lesser fire crab generates intense heat, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage with its touch. Creatures attacking a fire crab <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Unarmed-Attacks">unarmed</a> or with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural</a> weapons take fire damage each time their attacks hit. Any melee hit by a fire crab deals fire damage.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> Plane of Molten Skies or Elemental Planes of Fire<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, cluster (4-7), or colony (11-20)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Fire crabs are invertebrates found roaming the fiery shores of the Elemental Planes of Fire and the Plane of Molten Skies (see the <b>City of Brass</b> by <b>Necromancer Games</b> ).</p>
<p>Fire crabs can be found crawling the shores or swimming in pools and lakes of liquid flame. They are generally non-aggressive creatures and spend their time eating the heated rocks and plants found in the above-mentioned planes. Food not eaten is carried and stored in their lair, which takes the form of a large <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> under the fiery waters or on the shores near their âwater source.â Such <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>s are sometimes very large and can contain up to 20 of these creatures. On the Material Plane, fire crabs lair in volcanoes and near hot springs.</p>
<p>Fire crabs have large claws and in males, one claw is always larger (at least three times larger) than the other. Fire crabs have six segmented and spindly legs, blackish-red in color.</p>

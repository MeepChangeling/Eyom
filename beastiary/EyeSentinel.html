<h1>Eye Sentinel</h1>
<p class="title">Eye Sentinel <span class="level">CR 2</span></p>
<p class="description">An eyeball about twice the size of a human fist floats effortlessly into the room. The white of the sclera is intensely contrasted by bright red blood vessels which pulsate as it hovers before you. Disgusting sinewy material and musculature trails behind it like a tail. It does not seem to wish you harm but floats out of reach keeping a careful watch upon you.</p>

<p>Whenever an eye sentinel takes damage, it hisses as helium is expelled from its body, propelling it 10 feet backwards (away from the source of damage). This movement does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Sentinel_Servitude_Su">Sentinel Servitude (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Eye sentinels know only absolute servitude to their arcane masters. Should any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effects against it are automatically dispelled if any information about its master or its masterâs whereabouts is requested.</p>

<p>Eye sentinels are watchdogs for rogue wizards, used as both spies and guards to warn rogue mages of approaching âwitch/wizard huntersâ. These curiosities are the result of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ogre">ogre</a> being killed only through the use of light or color magic. In most cases the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ogre">ogre</a> becomes a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blind</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> shell of its former self while its limited intellect is transferred to the detached eyeballs. Eye sentinels gain both their ability to fly and their increased size due to the introduction of helium gas, thus becoming lighter-than-air and are able to move by suddenly pulling the muscles around them (which normally help them focus) sharply enough to induce movement.</p>
<p>An eye sentinelâs tail is fully prehensile, allowing it to manipulate objects nearly as well as a creature with hands. They cannot audibly communicate, but may do so nonvisually (such as with a pen and paper).</p>

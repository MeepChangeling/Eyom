<b>Languages</b> Common</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Create-Spawn-Su-"></a>Create Spawn (Su)</h4>
<p>Any humanoids slain by a spectre become spectres themselves in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical spectres, and suffer a â2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive â2 hp per HD, and only drain one level on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the spectre that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed spectres. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Resurrection-Vulnerability-Su-"></a>Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)</h4>
<p>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead">raise dead</a> or similar spell cast on a spectre destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Sunlight-Powerlessness-Ex-"></a>Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)</h4>
<p>Spectres are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daylight">daylight</a> spell) and flee from it. A spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Unnatural-Aura-Su-"></a>Unnatural Aura (Su)</h4>
<p>Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a spectre at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal">Handle Animal</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride">Ride</a>, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so as long as it is within 30 feet of the spectre.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/>
<b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, gang (3â6), or swarm (7â12)<br/>
<b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>Spectres are evil undead that hate sunlight and living things. Most are the remnants of murdered or evil humans, their anger preventing them from entering the afterlife. Like ghosts, spectres haunt the places of their deaths, and seek to draw others into the lonely abyss of undeath.</p>
<h3>Variants</h3>
<p><b>Corpulent Spectre (+1 CR)</b>: Ancient spectres that are able to satisfy their all-consuming rage by engaging in perpetual, gluttonous feasts upon the living undergo a startling transformation, growing in size and strength as their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> bulk <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> and writhes around them in miasmal folds, appearing as an obese, ghostly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>. A corpulent spectre gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/advanced-creature-cr-1">advanced creature</a> simple template, and while it doesnât gain the bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor</a> that template normally grants, its Large size grants it greater reach. Although its size category doesnât change, its reach with its melee attacks increases by 5 feet.</p>

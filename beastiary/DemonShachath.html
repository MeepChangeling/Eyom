<h1>Demon, Shachath</h1>
<p class="description">This winged abomination is a horrid mix of demonic and angelic features, as if two bodies were carelessly fused into one. Its fanged, inhuman face is frozen in permanent contempt, while a beautiful visage with an expression of horror bulges from the back of its skull.</p>

<h4><span id="Merge_with_Host_Su"><a name="TOC-Merge-with-Host-Su-"></a>Merge with Host (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> that provokes an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>, a shachath can merge its body with that of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> creature and control it if the victim fails a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same shachath’s merge with host ability for 24 hours. While merged with a victim, a shachath gains control of the body and may use it as its own, as if it controlled the target via <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-monster">dominate monster</a>. <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/misdirection">Misdirection</a> or similar effects can hide the victim’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> change. The shachath has full access to all of the host’s defensive and offensive abilities, and the shachath can still use its own <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> as well. As long as the shachath occupies the host, it knows (and can speak) the languages known by the victim and basic information about the victim’s identity and personality. It can learn specific memories or knowledge from the victim by telepathic communication as needed. Damage dealt to a host body does not harm the shachath, and if the host body is slain, the shachath emerges and is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> for 1 round. A shachath can choose to abandon a host body as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>, but doing so causes the host to be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> for 1 round, and the shachath must wait 24 hours before attempting to use merge with host again on any target. A shachath can be ejected from a host through the use of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/break-enchantment">break enchantment</a> (against CL 13th), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-chaos">dispel chaos</a>, or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-evil">dispel evil</a>. Merge with host is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> possession effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Subtle_Magic_Su"><a name="TOC-Subtle-Magic-Su-"></a>Subtle Magic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever a shachath targets a creature with a spell, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> ability, and that spell or ability has no obvious physical effects, the targeted creature has no sense of having been the target of a magical effect after making a successful saving throw against the effect. If the ability requires a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> but the target is unaware of being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares">threatened</a>, the shachath can attempt an opposed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff">Bluff</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</a> check to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> the target without arousing suspicion or being noticed.</p>
<h4><span id="Trophy_Taker_Su"><a name="TOC-Trophy-Taker-Su-"></a>Trophy Taker (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A shachath that takes a personal item from a prospective target can wield greater power over that creature. The item must be something that the target considers its own possession and carries with it most of the time (for example, a piece of jewelry, a favored weapon, a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-and-skill-kits#TOC-Holy-Symbol-Silver-or-Wooden">holy symbol</a>, or some other memento). The shachath gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw DCs for all of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> that target the owner of the trophy. This bonus increases to +4 if the trophy is the target’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-and-skill-kits#TOC-Holy-Symbol-Silver-or-Wooden">holy symbol</a>. A shachath can only have one trophy at any time, and it loses any benefit from an existing trophy if it takes a new one.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Abyss)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or cabal (1 plus 1â2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/succubus">succubi</a> and 1â3 incubi)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (+1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a>, other treasure)</p>
<p>A shachath’s duplicitous nature is reflected in its physical form. It is literally two-faced, and sees and speaks easily from either side of its skull. One face is angelic and the other horrific, but a shachath is a single being of pure malevolence. Shachaths are concerned with the destruction of mortal faith in anything, and are most often found in the service of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords/baphomet">Baphomet</a> and Pazuzu. A typical shachath is 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs 320 pounds.</p>
<p>Shachaths are living embodiments of blasphemy. They form in the Abyss from truly blasphemous soulsâthose who actively work against true believers. Their merged forms can be inverted at their whims; at one moment, the demonic face might be carrying on a conversation, and in the next, with a folding of flesh and a cracking of bones, the shachath can bring its angelic face to the fore.</p>
<p>Shachaths that reside in the Abyss typically act as advisors and counselors to more powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> that seek their unique insight into good gods, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>, and the mortal condition itself. Others are skilled at interrogating and breaking good-aligned prisoners. On the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, shachaths dedicate their efforts toward the corruption of mortal faith. This can represent an attack upon a devout <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a> or an entire communityâor both, if they can manage.</p>

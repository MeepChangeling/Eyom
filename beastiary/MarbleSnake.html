<h1>Marble Snake</h1>

<h4><a name="TOC-Whistle-Su-"></a>Whistle (Su)</h4>
<p>A marble snake can whistle, gaining the attention of any creature within 50 feet that hears it. All creatures (other than marble snakes) with the area must succeed on a DC 11 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become entranced. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same marble snake’s whistle for one day. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p>An entranced victim walks toward the marble snake, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, that creature gets a second <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving throw</a>. The effect continues for as long as the marble snake whistles and for 1 round thereafter. An entranced victim is effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> (cannot attack, but can defend). If an entranced opponent is attacked, the effect is immediately broken. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>‘s countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save.</p>

<p>The marble snake, unlike normal snakes, adapts very well to its environment, hence it can be found just about anywhere, though underground encounters are rare. The marble snake prefers sunlight and warmth to the cold and darkness of dungeons and caverns and most often makes its lair in high, sunny altitudes. Typically an encounter is with a single marble snake. In instances where more than one is encountered, they will a mated pair and young. A female marble snake is usually only encountered during mating season (when she lays 1d10 eggs). Marble snake eggs are milky-white with gray-brown flecks. An egg can fetch up to 5 gp on the open market.</p>
<p>A typical marble snake is 10 feet long and can grow to a length of 20 feet.</p>
<p>Marble snakes are generally non-aggressive creatures, though if cornered, threatened, or hungry, they attack on sight. A marble snake opens combat with its whistling and attacks relentlessly those that fall under its sway.</p>

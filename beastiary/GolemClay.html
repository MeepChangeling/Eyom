<h1>Golem, Clay</h1>
<p class="description">This lumbering figure is sculpted from soft clay. It wears filthy rags and crude jewelry, and its face is only vaguely humanoid.</p>

<h4><span id="Berserk_Ex">Berserk (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a clay golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. This chance resets to 0% after one minute of inactivity. A berserk golem attacks the nearest living creature or smashes some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach. Once it goes berserk, no known method can reestablish control.</p>
<h4><span id="Cursed_Wound_Ex">Cursed Wound (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The damage a clay golem deals doesn’t heal naturally and resists magical healing. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by a clay golem must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature.</p>
<h4><span id="Haste_Su">Haste (Su)</span></h4>
<p>After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a clay golem can haste itself once per day as a free action. The effect lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A clay golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/move-earth" rel="nofollow">move earth</a> spell drives the golem back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it (no save).</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disintegrate" rel="nofollow">disintegrate</a> spell slows the golem (as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow" rel="nofollow">slow</a> spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage (no save).</li>
<li>An <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/earthquake" rel="nofollow">earthquake</a> spell cast directly at a clay golem stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of damage (no save).</li>
<li>Any magical attack against a clay golem that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A clay golem gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or gang (2â4)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment around its hips. It stands over 8 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.</p>
<h4><span id="Construction"><a name="TOC-Construction"></a>Construction</span></h4>
<p>A clay golem’s body must be sculpted from a single block of clay weighing at least 1,000 pounds, treated with rare oils and powders worth 1,500 gp.</p>

<p><b>Panthereons</b>: Panthereons are cat-headed clay golems which were once built to act as mighty guardians. To create a Panthereon, modify a clay golem as follows: CR 11, add bite +19 (4d6+7 plus cursed wound), speed 30 ft., add <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-initiative-combat">Improved Initiative</a> as a bonus feat, change <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative">initiative</a> modifier to +3. Some of the golems may have suffered from significant erosion over the years, in which case they may be at below average <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>.</p>

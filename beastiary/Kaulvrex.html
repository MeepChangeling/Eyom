<h1>Kaulvrex</h1>
<p class="description">Chitin covers the entirety of this insect-like humanoid. Its multi-faceted eyes reflect their surroundings, while its mandible drip a caustic, green ooze. The creature has two powerful arms, ending in a four-clawed hand. A third, smaller arm, more suited for delicate work, protrudes from its chest. Its lengthy tail ends in two wicked, red-hot prongs.</p>

<h4><span id="Chemical_Brand_Ex">Chemical Brand (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a kaulvrex damages an opponent with its tail, the target gains an indelible chemical marker. A kaulvrex gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-">scent</a> ability with respect to the target, and when it detects the marker, it gains a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus">morale bonus</a> on attack and damage rolls against the target. The marked creature must spend an hour scrubbing off the chemical brand to render it undetectable to kaulvrexes.</p>
<h4><span id="Chemical_Communication_Ex">Chemical Communication (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Kaulvrexes can communicate with other kaulvrexes within 60 feet via pheromone transmission.</p>
<p>In a kaulvrex hive, this range extends to cover the entire hive.</p>
<p>This is a silent and instantaneous mode of communication only kaulvrexes can understand.</p>
<h4><span id="Third_Arm_Ex">Third Arm (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A kaulvrex has an extra arm that does not give it any extra attacks or actions per round. However, it can manipulate or hold items as well as the kaulvrex’s other arms.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any temperate or warm land<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair or hive (3-12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Ancient insectile beings engineered kaulvrexes as a servitor species with proficiency in combat. They are highly adaptive creatures and can live and thrive in all but the most hostile environments, a feature that allowed them to serve as their creators’ proxies in wars (sometimes between the creators) on a variety of planets. Kaulvrexes emancipated themselves from their makers helped in part by a devastating disease that wiped out most of the creators while leaving kaulvrexes untouched. They retained their warlike instincts but generally refuse to fight one another en masse, preferring champions to settle disputes between hives. They also retreated to more inhospitable locations on the worlds where they were stranded and maintain a distance from other habitations.</p>
<p>Kaulvrexes gather in hives led by a kaulvrex who becomes agendered when it assumes leadership. Sages who study kaulvrexes do not know whether this transformation was ‘programmed’ in by their creators to prevent romantic distractions during battle or the kaulvrexes developed this after the won their freedom.</p>
<p>Typical kaulvrexes stand over 6 and a half feet in height and weigh nearly 250 pounds. They have relatively short lifespans, appropriate to their engineered nature, with the longest-lived specimens reaching the age of 50.</p>

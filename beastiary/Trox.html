<p>Trox were once members of a much smaller and more docile race of subterranean <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ers, but were long ago enslaved by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-duergar">duergar</a> and bred into useful brutes. Eventually, several clans of trox were able to escape their slavers and reach the surface world, though they found the creatures above were just as eager to enslave them. Most trox still live a life of servitude. A free trox tends to be loyal to its true friends and inquisitive, though it can harbor deep grudges and resentments.</p>

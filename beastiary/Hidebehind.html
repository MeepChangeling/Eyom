<p>A hidebehind may use its incredible <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed" style="font-style: italic">speed</a> to move into any unoccupied space thatâs within its movement range (normally 60 feet) without provoking <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> or suffering from difficult terrain. Hidebehinds that have had their movement hindered (such as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Tanglefoot-Bag">tanglefoot bag</a> or a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>) must successfully free themselves before using this ability. A hidebehind cannot use this ability if it used it in the previous round.</p>

<p>A hidebehind may use its legendary stealth to hide from attacks.

<p>Travel through forests in the Fey World is often perilous and frightening due to the inscrutable rules that govern the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> realm.</p>
<p>However, no single creature can make the lives of travelers more miserable and horrifying than the hidebehind. Created by a mysterious Eldest long ago, the hidebehinds are despicable beings that care only about sating their endless hunger. They are tall, brutish monsters with long arms, sweeping curved claws, and jet-black fur. They are intelligent and can understand languages, but hidebehinds cannot speak because their mouths have razor-sharp mandibles instead of a lower jaw.</p>
<p>They are unbelievably fast and get their name from their practice of ambushing their chosen prey with stealthy attacks from behind trees or bushes. A hidebehind lives a solitary life in a lair adorned with small, often valueless trinkets. Outside of their annual mating season, hidebehinds are hyper-territorial and they will hunt and kill any trespassers, including others of their race. Villages that are within sight of old growth forests are often hit hardest by hidebehind attacks. Stories have spread of severe economic disruptions in a region due to a single hidebehind in an especially inconvenient location, since these beasts enjoy killing solitary merchants or traveling farmers that supply food and trade goods to a region. Some scholars have wondered if hidebehinds are aware of how their actions can affect local communities and are actively trying to cause as much pain as possible.</p>
<p>An average hidebehind is about 6 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds, with females slightly larger than males.</p>

<h1>Rawbones</h1>
<p class="description">Skulking towards you is what appears to be a freshly skinned and cleaned corpse. It is a bloody, skeletal creature with bits of flesh and muscle still clinging to its wet bones. Its entrails and organs hang loosely in its torso, sometimes even dropping out entirely. Its eyes roll about in its eye sockets as it seeks its prey. </p>

<p>A rawbones is an undead creature that comes into being when a tortured person rises from the grave. Rawbones are commonly found in ancient dungeons that hold old torture chambers and prison cells. Some are also found haunting the local cemeteries where a tortured person was laid to rest. While disgusting in appearance, there is something in the magic (or evil) of a rawbones that keeps it looking ‘fresher’ that most of its other undead kin.</p>
<p>Like many undead, rawbones despise the living and seek to harm such creatures whenever they can. A rawbones is generally a solitary creature though it is possible more than one could be encountered together (e.g., an ancient dungeon where a mass torture/execution took place or a mass grave where tortured and broken bodies where laid to rest).</p>
<p>A rawbones stands 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs roughly 140 pounds. Its bones are stained red with fresh blood which seems to continually weep from the creature’s body. Bits of flesh and muscle fall away from it as it moves about and its entrails often <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Drag">drag</a> the ground behind it or are wrapped around the creature’s forearms.</p>
<p>A rawbones speaks Common and at least one other language.</p>
<p>A rawbones’ <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>.</p>

<p>Tupilaqs are small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> crafted out of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cetacean/whale">whale</a> bones and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cetacean/whale">whale</a> teeth for the sole purpose of murdering the creator’s enemies. A tupilaq’s appearance can vary based on its construction, but all have prominent jaws and a small body with hands and feet fit for swimming. A tupilaq usually stands 3 feet tall and weighs only 30 pounds.</p>
<p>Tupilaqs must be created in secrecyâif any other person discovers the tupilaq is being created, the attempt to build the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> immediately fails. As part of its creation, the creator invites or lures a host spirit to possess the tupilaq. Most often, the animus of a tupilaq is that of a dead child or other small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>, and the parity of size between the new vessel and the spirit’s previous body is what gives the creature a speed and agility on land and in water that is atypical for most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>. This trapped spirit is also what makes a tupilaq so savage and murderous.</p>
<h3><span id="Tupilaq_Construction">Tupilaq Construction</span></h3>
<p>A tupilaq is built from 30 pounds of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cetacean/whale">whale</a> bones, bound together with sinew.

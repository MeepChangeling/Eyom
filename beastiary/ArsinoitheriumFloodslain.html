<h4><span id="Crashing_Waters_Su"><a name="TOC-Crashing-Waters-Su-"></a>Crashing Waters (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day, a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/floodslain-creature-cr-1">floodslain creature</a> can instinctively summon a spectral echo of the rushing waters that created it. This mass of phantom water slams the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/floodslain-creature-cr-1">floodslain</a> creature from behind, carrying it forward at up to three times its normal speed and enabling it to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a> a single target. These waters also impact all creatures near the end of the floodslain creature’s movement, pushing them back. This acts as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush">bull rush</a>; the floodslain creature attempts a single <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check against the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> of each creature within 10 feet of the end of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a>. This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush">bull rush</a> attempt doesn’t provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su"><a name="TOC-Create-Spawn-Su-"></a>Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature killed by a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/floodslain-creature-cr-1">floodslain</a> creature rises as a floodslain creature if it’s left immersed in water for 24 hours. These spawn aren’t under the control of their creators.</p>
<h4><span id="Drowning_Touch_Su"><a name="TOC-Drowning-Touch-Su-"></a>Drowning Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The slam attack of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/floodslain-creature-cr-1">floodslain</a> creature partially fills a living victim’s lungs with water. The victim must succeed at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw in order to cough up this water or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued">fatigued</a> for 1d4 rounds. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued">fatigued</a> creature that fails this save becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted">exhausted</a> instead. An <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted">exhausted</a> creature that fails this save is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> and falls to 0 hp. A creature at 0 hp that fails this save drops to â1 hp and begins <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a>. A creature killed in this fashion appears to have drowned.</p>
<h4><span id="Flash_Flood_Su"><a name="TOC-Flash-Flood-Su-"></a>Flash Flood (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/floodslain-creature-cr-1">floodslain</a> creature is constantly surrounded by an echo of the disaster that originally took its life. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Water">Water</a> streams from the floodslain creature’s body, forming a 30-foot-radius pool that renders the ground in that area slick and muddy and increases the DCs of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> checks made in the area by 5.</p>
<h4><span id="Panic_Su"><a name="TOC-Panic-Su-"></a>Panic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The dead eyes of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/floodslain-creature-cr-1">floodslain</a> creature are frozen with shock and fear. The floodslain creature can induce fear in a living victim as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. Targets must succeed at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1d6 rounds. A creature can be affected by the same floodslain creature’s panic attack only once every 24 hours.</p>

<p>When snowmelt floods it causes flash floods. Those who drown in the turbulent waters often rise as floodslain and spread the misery and death that created them.</p>
<p>Collectively known as âthe after-stormâ by natives, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/floodslain-creature-cr-1">floodslain</a> are victims of flash floods that have risen as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>. They’re creatures of panic and despair, driven by anger, fear, and a yearning to drag others into the waters.</p>
<p>Long after the floodwaters recede, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/floodslain-creature-cr-1">floodslain</a> continue spreading the miserable death that claimed them.</p>
<p>Floodslain are similar in appearance to their original living forms, and are recognizable even in their water-logged state. Many were gruesomely damaged by the floods that took their lives, though, their bodies battered and broken by rushing water and debris. The one feature common among all floodslain is wild, panicked eyesâa telltale sign of a death mired in shock and fear. Floodslain tend to drift toward lower ground, as if seeking the very water that transformed them. While this habitual migration makes them a contained threat in some areas, flat floodplains offer little resistance to the wandering undead. They can be found floating in major rivers, trapped in ravines and valleys, and staggering across flatlands, sometimes in large numbers. Floodslain that come close to living creatures try to drown them, and relentlessly follow those who flee. Targets who escape often draw the attention of yet more floodslain, eventually leading the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> to their homes. In great numbers, floodslain can slaughter small settlements.</p>
<p>While many find the possibility of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> born from purely natural disasters to be disturbing in and of itself, theories from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druids</a> and scholars hold even more chilling implications.</p>

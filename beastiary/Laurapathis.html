<p>Any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> used by the laurapathis which manipulates flame or has the fire subtype functions normally while underwater, having identical effects to the spell or ability when used on dry land. Combustible material burns normally if ignited by one of these spells or effects. Even non-magical fires personally ignited or set by a Laurapathis underwater function normally when submerged. These flames only heat the surrounding waters to the same degree a similar, dry-land flame would heat the air around it, and any smoke generated by the flame rises gradually, before being swept away as a sooty current of stained water.</p>

<p>Laurapathis are an arrogant and imperious species of merfolk.</p>
<p>They are among the finest occult craftsmen the sea has to offer, blessed with the ability to make water burn.</p>
<p>With their magical forgeflames, Laurapathis practice crafts otherwise unknown to ocean dwellers. Where a Laurapathis walks, civilization springs up, as mer-kind culture rapidly evolves from hunting and gathering, with sharpened stone and bone weapons to settled, technologically advanced kingdoms. With their keen intellects and unbridled ambition, Laurapathis often establish themselves as the rulers of these early kingdoms.</p>
<p>Laurapathis are effective, albeit bloodthirsty rulers. They offer prosperity, wealth and privilege to their loyal and competent minions. Those who resist their new order, or who speak against the laurapathis, are left to starve and struggle by a mer-folk society that is rapidly passing them by. Laurapathis encourage their followers to overhunt with their new metal weapons and wire nets, in order to deplete the game these dissidents depend on survival. Those who actually take up arms against the laurapathis regime are slaughtered by the well-armed, well-trained militia the creature takes a personal hand in establishing. Those taken alive are tortured to death over hours, burnt and boiled alive in ways water-living creatures could never even imagine enduring. It takes only a few such lessons for a merfolk community to fall firmly in line behind the fascistic Laurapathis.</p>
<p>Laurapathis are titanic, powerfully muscled mer-creatures.</p>
<p>Their lower bodies are the spiked, vermilion exoskeleton of an enormous crab, larger than a horse. Their pincers can easily shred a grown warrior, and are as adept when forging â Laurapathis use their pincers to grip, cut and press hot metal into shape. Their upper bodies are humanlike.</p>
<p>Laurapathis skin is thick and rubbery, like a dolphinâs hide, and their faces are leonine. Laurapathis are prideful and decorative. They braid their hair in intricate knots, often braiding in coral and jewels into the strands, and favor intricately carved gold jewelry, bracelets and mail.</p>
<p>Laurapathis take enormous pride in their smithing skills, and their weapons and any armor worn will always be gilded and etched with animal motifs.</p>

<h4><span id="Memory_Globe_Su">Memory Globe (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A karek traps memories in iridescent spheres. A creature may use the sphere to cast <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-dead">speak with dead</a> as if it were the intact corpse of the creature the memories came from, even if that creature is alive. The creatureâs knowledge is limited to the time the memory globe was created. A globe has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 5 and 15 hp and is worth 200 gp to the right buyer.</p>
<h4><span id="Remembered_Form_Sp">Remembered Form (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A karek can assume the form of a creature whose memories it holds in a memory globe as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. The karek can take the form of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> creature and has access to the assumed formâs mannerisms and speech patterns, up to the time the globe was created. The mimicked creature may be living or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a>. The karek gains a +20 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> checks to appear and act as the imitated creature and can maintain the effect indefinitely. The karek can revert to its true form as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> and automatically reverts if it loses possession of the memory globe for the mimicked creature.</p>
<p>This ability otherwise functions as assume appearance.</p>
<h4><span id="Slumber_Hex_Su">Slumber Hex (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A karek can use the slumber hex as if it were a 9th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch">witch</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Trap_Memory_Su">Trap Memory (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A karek can take memories from a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> creature or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> living creature it touches as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> that provokes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>
<p>The touched creature must succeed on a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or a copy of the creatureâs memories form a memory globe in the karekâs claws. An <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> creature gains a +4 bonus on the saving throw. This ability can affect a creature that has been <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> for no more than a number of days equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Vulnerable_to_Reflections_Ex">Vulnerable to Reflections (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A karekâs reflection always shows the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">feyâs</a> true appearance. A karek mimicking another creature using its remembered form ability that can see its own reflection is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> until it averts its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a>, changes form, or closes its eyes.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Fey World)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or storytelling (3â6)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (memory globes and other treasure)</p>
<p>Karek are the historians and heralds of the fey, chronicling the legacies of great heroes and villains, the ravages of the Tane, and the deeds of the Eldest. They invisibly fly over battlefields or watch over events where notables gather, hoping to add to their collection of preserved knowledge.</p>
<p>Karek avoid combat whenever possible, preferring to use guile, magic, and stealth. Only a threat to their memory globe collection provokes karek to aggressive action, and they track globe thieves unceasingly.</p>
<p>Karek openly serve as storytellers and advisors to fey lords or fill the same role in an assumed guise for remarkable mortals. Karek gather when a noteworthy figure nears death. They often compete to see who can catch dying creature’s memories first. Karek meet in great storytelling circles, sharing the memories they have gained and performing fabled moments from fallen legends.</p>
<p>A typical karek is 3 feet tall, has a 5-foot wingspan, and weighs 18 pounds. Traveling karek bring 2d4 memory globes for disguises and have dozens of globes hidden in their homes.</p>

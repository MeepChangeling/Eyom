<h4><a name="TOC-Euphoric-Slime-Ex-"></a>Euphoric Slime (Ex)</h4>
<p>Sanguine oozes are composed of congealed euphoric toxins. Any living creature that begins its turn affected by the swarmâs viscous ability must make a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or erupt into uncontrollable laughter and be effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for that round. This is a mind-affecting effect. Creatures immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison">poison</a> are immune to this effect.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Viscous-Ex-"></a>Viscous (Ex)</h4>
<p>Whenever an alchemical ooze swarm makes a swarm attack on a creature of Small size or larger, that creature must make a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or be covered in patches of sticky <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> globules. Those who fail are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> until the patches of ooze are removed. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> can be removed by spending a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> to fling off the globulesâthough this action might be impeded by the oozeâs effects. If a creature affected by this ability takes any amount of cold damage, the ooze patches are immediately destroyed. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p><b>Environment</b> any underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or coagulum (3â5)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to compose the bodies of living beings.</p>
<p>Appearing at first to be a collection of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent. Each swarm is composed of several hundred palm-sized balls of ooze that all scuttle along as a single unit.</p>

<h4><span id="Ablative_Adaptation_Su"><a name="TOC-Ablative-Adaptation-Su-"></a>Ablative Adaptation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, the Grand Defender can shed its outer layer of metal, revealing a slightly smaller version of itself underneath. This new form may be made of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a> (changing its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-">DR</a> to 15/<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a>), <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Mithral">mithral</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-">DR</a> 15/silver), or iron (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-">DR</a> 15/<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a>, as normal). Its attacks count as this metal type for overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>. If the herald is brought to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds its outer layer and reanimates at half its normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>.</p>
<p>Once shed, the outer layer decays into worthless powder over 1d4 minutes.</p>
<h4><span id="Breath_Weapon_Su"><a name="TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-"></a>Breath Weapon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The herald’s poisonous <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> functions like that of an iron <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> every 1d4 rounds, 10 ft. cube, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 19, 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a>, 2 consecutive saves). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. The cloud persists for 1 round.</p>
<h4><span id="Defender8217s_Shield_Ex"><a name="TOC-Defender-s-Shield-Ex-"></a>Defender’s Shield (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The herald’s shield is a +3 heavy steel shield, though it becomes non-magical if the herald is destroyed or is no longer holding or wearing it.</p>
<h4><span id="Hammer_Storm_Ex"><a name="TOC-Hammer-Storm-Ex-"></a>Hammer Storm (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The herald can expel a volley of warhammers from its mouth, which functions like a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> (30-foot cone, 15d6 bludgeoning damage plus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/awesome-blow">Awesome Blow</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> 19 half, usable 1/day). If the herald is in its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Mithral">mithral</a> form, these hammers count as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a> or silver, respectively. The herald can exclude any number of squares in the cone. The hammer storm creates 24 physical warhammers that persist after the instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures (though they’re normal warhammers, not masterwork, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Mithral">mithral</a>). The herald can spend 1 minute eating 24 warhammers (or an equivalent amount of metal such as that created by its ablative adaptation ability) to recharge this ability. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Su"><a name="TOC-Immunity-to-Magic-Su-"></a>Immunity to Magic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The herald has the same <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to magic as an iron <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land (extraplanar)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology8"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p>The spirits within the Grand Defender retain all their mortal memories and knowledge, and when in the mortal world they have been known to recognize or call out through the herald to old friends, relatives, or offspring with an unexpected familiarity and affection. If visiting a place one of its spirits had been as a mortal, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> might know secret exits or caches of materials long forgotten by the current inhabitants.</p>
<p>Without the heroic spirits, the herald barely has a will of its own and acts in a programmed fashion like a common iron <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a>; however,it is never sent to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> that way, and existing knowledge of its âemptyâ state only comes from rare visitors who encountered the herald.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> controlled by dead heroes, the Grand Defender has no need for rest or sustenance.</p>
<p>However, the controlling spirits may enjoy the company of other creatures, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> can consume materials, though its sense of âtasteâ is certainly altered to suit its magical abilities. For example, most of the heroic souls report mild intoxication after eating metal in order to recharge the hammer storm ability.</p>

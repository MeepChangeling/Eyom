<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su"><a name="TOC-Create-Spawn-Su-"></a>Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A humanoid creature killed by a festering spirit’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> becomes a festering spirit under the control of its killer in 1d4 days. Giving the corpse a proper burial (or cremation) prevents it from becoming a festering spirit.</p>
<h4><span id="Ghost_Touch_Su"><a name="TOC-Ghost-Touch-Su-"></a>Ghost Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A festering spirit can manipulate corporeal objects that weigh up to 25 pounds as if those objects had the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ghost-touch">ghost touch</a> special ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Slime_Su"><a name="TOC-Slime-Su-"></a>Slime (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A festering spirit’s slime resembles the putrefying sludge of decaying corpses. Any creature that is hit by the spirit’s incorporeal touch attack, passes through its square, or hits it with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapon</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a> must attempt a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. On a failure, the creature is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4 rounds, and on a success the creature is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round. A festering spirit’s slime persists on objects and creatures for 1d10 minutes but has no harmful effect after its initial contact. Creatures immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> are immune to this ability. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Trample_Ex"><a name="TOC-Trample-Ex-"></a>Trample (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The DC of a festering spirit’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Trample-Ex-">trample</a> is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land or underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or gang (3â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>A festering spirit arises when a vile person’s corpse is put in a mass grave, or when such a person is buried, exhumed, and placed in a charnel house or ossuary. The lingering hatred and evil of the dead mixes with the worst remnants of dozens of other people, creating a frustrated incorporeal shade of sickness, hate, and rot. Powerful mortals might arise as multiple festering spirits, each spawned from a different aspect of the original creature’s personality.</p>
<p>A festering spirit can’t travel more than a mile from its remains. When left alone for long periods, a festering spirit usually wanders the halls and rooms near its burial site, destroying things, indulging in pranks, or trying to eat and drink anything it finds palatable (which falls through its incorporeal body to no effect). Its senses can barely detect these treats, though some adventurers report that strong alcohol and spicy foods can distract the spirit as it savors these sensations.</p>

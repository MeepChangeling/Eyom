<h1>Herald of Armageddon</h1>
<p class="description">A long crimson cloak drapes over the form of this large faceless being, which floats just above the ground on footless legs as its menacing flail crackles with blue currents of electricity.</p>

<h4><span id="Adaptable_Life_Force_Su"><a name="TOC-Adaptable-Life-Force-Su-"></a>Adaptable Life Force (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any effect that heals living creatures and harms <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> or heals <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> and harms living creatures (such as cure spells, inflict spells, and channeled energy) always heals the herald, even if the source of the power intended to harm it.</p>
<h4><span id="Contact_Other_Plane_Sp"><a name="TOC-Contact-Other-Plane-Sp-"></a>Contact Other Plane (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>This ability functions as the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/contact-other-plane">contact other plane</a>, but the herald can only ask questions on the behalf of another creature, the questioner (not the herald) must make the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> check (if any) to avoid losing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>, and the loss is permanent rather than temporary.</p>
<h4><span id="Destructive_Aura_Su"><a name="TOC-Destructive-Aura-Su-"></a>Destructive Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, the herald can emit a 30-foot aura of destruction for 15 rounds per day. All attacks made against targets in this aura (including the herald) gain a +7 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus">morale bonus</a> on damage rolls, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
<h4><span id="Maddening_Strike_Su"><a name="TOC-Maddening-Strike-Su-"></a>Maddening Strike (Su)</span></h4>
<p>If the herald successfully hits a creature with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/flail-heavy">flail</a>, as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> it may force the opponent to make a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. If the creature fails its save, it is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a> for 1 round. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Madness_Ex"><a name="TOC-Madness-Ex-"></a>Madness (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The herald uses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves instead of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> modifier, and is immune to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/insanity">insanity</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confusion</a> effects. Only a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle">miracle</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a> can remove its madness. If this occurs, the herald gains 6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> and loses 6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>; it automatically reverts to its insane state 1d10 minutes later.</p>
<h4><span id="Telepathic_Bond_Sp"><a name="TOC-Telepathic-Bond-Sp-"></a>Telepathic Bond (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>This ability functions like <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/telepathic-bond">telepathic bond</a>, except any creature linked to the heraldâs disturbing thoughts takes 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> every 10 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Astral-Plane">Astral Plane</a>)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (Large +1 <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shock">shock</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/flail-heavy">heavy flail</a>, other treasure) </p>
<p>The Herald of Armageddon is an enigmatic creature that is both more and less mysterious than its master. It looks like a giant shrouded figure floating above the ground, legless and faceless, wielding a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/flail-heavy">heavy flail</a> with ends made of glowing energy. Its visage is often confused with a reaping <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, though it is a living <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsider</a> and acts mildly insulted when others assume it to be otherwise. Its voice is hollow and distorted, as if echoing from the far end of a long metal tube, and colored with accents from ruined empires and dead languages. It rarely comes to the prime material plane, and for most of these visits it is merely a silent witness to a great slaughter upon the battlefield or the last gasp of a dying city, though it may strike out with its weapon or magic at a seemingly random wounded or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a> target, as if making sure the creature dies as expected.</p>
<p>The herald may be insane from associating with the god of Armageddon, but it has a clarity unknown to mortal worshipers; perhaps its vast knowledge somehow protected it from a truly insane fate, or its status as a herald may give it a kind of lucidity that pierces the fog of madness. It does not cackle at itself like a madman, respond to unheard voices, kill for pleasure, or exhibit any of a dozen other obvious signs of insanity typically exhibited by the mad followers of Armageddon. </p>
<p>The herald does not eat, drink, or breathe; it lacks a face or mouth, and cannot be bribed with food or pleasure. It acts like an unfeeling thing, more patient than a mountain, slowly scouring away at existence like the oceanâs tide or a desert wind. It has no role in the creation of life, and does not seem to take any part in the cultivation or upbringing of creatures or civilizations.</p>
<p>Though it is known to kill without being provoked, it only does so if the target has already suffered serious harm or is on the brink of death, and even these it may ignore; it has drifted over a bloody battle, passing hundreds of dying heroes and officers, only to strike at a single common soldier before vanishing. Once, it killed a human woman moments after a difficult but successful birth, and chose to spare the child. It acts in this callous way toward mortals, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>, and even <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragons</a>, but never against mindless creatures or those with animal-level intellect. Perhaps these killings are the directive of its god, steering a soulâs course in the afterlife or preventing some future event; perhaps they represent an obscure code, with the time of death and name of the deceased unlocking a cipher over the course of a millennium; or perhaps they are just random acts of violence, the only evidence of the creatureâs tightly suppressed lunacy. If attacked, the herald retaliates, though sometimes it ends combat simply by driving some or all of its opponents insane and then retreating. It may return to dispatch these defeated foes days, months, or years later, even on the victimâs deathbed, or it may ignore them utterly and show no recognition if the healed opponents confront it again.</p>
<p>When called by mortals, the herald demands specific deeds of death, injury, or property damage, for the herald always seeks to further the end of times. For example, it may ask that every third adult male in a village be branded on the face with a mysterious symbol, or that a prince with black hair be nearly drowned, or a castleâs eastern wall be cracked but left standing. Usually, these acts have no apparent link to the needs of the heraldâs conjurer, and most create a series of events that takes years or decades to play out. It favors the burning of incense and exotic woods, lingering over the fragrant smoke and making strange contortions. </p>

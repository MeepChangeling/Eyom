<h4><span id="Apocalyptic_Breath_Weapon_Su">Apocalyptic Breath Weapon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Each apocalypse horse has a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> it can use once every 1d4 rounds as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> always fills a 90-foot cone, and can be resisted with a successful DC 38 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save, but the exact effects of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> depend on the horse. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Crushing_Hooves_Ex">Crushing Hooves (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An apocalypse horseâs hoof attacks are primary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage, and add 1-1/2 times its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier to damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Energy_Drain_Su">Energy Drain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An apocalypse horse inflicts 1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative level</a> whenever it hits with a bite or a hoof attack. When it tramples a creature, it inflicts 1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative level</a> unless the creature trampled fails a DC 32 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save, in which case the creature takes 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Favor_of_the_Four_Su">Favor of the Four (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Each apocalypse horse has several unique, thematic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> and a unique <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> based on which of the four Horsemen it serves.</p>
<h4><span id="Unyielding_to_Oblivion_Su">Unyielding to Oblivion (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Intrinsically linked to their riders, apocalypse horses cannot die in the presence of their Horsemen. When being ridden or within 300 feet of its associated Horseman, rather than falling <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> when below 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, an apocalypse horse instead gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> condition, with additional damage simply increasing its number of negative <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> but carrying no other penalties. An apocalypse horse that is slain by a spell that causes instantaneous death rises as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-resurrection">true resurrection</a> 1 round later, reconstituted in a manner consistent with its riderâs theme. Whenever an apocalypse horse fails a saving throw against any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>, petrification, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph">polymorph</a>, or immobilizing effect (including <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/binding">binding</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/imprisonment">imprisonment</a>, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/temporal-stasis">temporal stasis</a>), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect as long as its associated Horseman remains within 300 feet of where the effect originally targeted the apocalypse horse. Attempting this new saving throw requires no action. An apocalypse horse can attempt a new save to end the effect once per round.</p>
<p>An apocalypse horse more than 300 feet from its associated Horseman loses all benefits of the Unyielding to Oblivion ability.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary (unique), group (all four apocalypse horses), or with associated Horseman<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The apocalypse horse is less a particularly puissant nightmare or powerful equine <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Daemon">daemon</a> than a living extension of one of the Four Horsemen. There only four at any time: the white horse of Pestilence, the pale horse of Death, the red horse of War, and the black horse of Famine.</p>
<p>While for the most part the Horsemen use their mounts themselves, they have been known to lend these mounts to favored daemonic or mortal servitors. The four apocalypse horses have also been known to travel the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> or other planes on their own or in a group, often as a precursor to more direct attention to a world from the Horsemen. While each of the four apocalypse horses have similar statistics overall, they have unique abilities and personalities suited to their specific theme.</p>
<p>An apocalypse horse is similar in size to a large horse, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing 1,500 pounds despite its nearly skeletal frame.</p>
<p class="title">The Black Horse of Famine
<p>The Black Horse of Trelmarixian is the Horse of Famine.</p>
<p>Its body looks particularly emaciated, with its midnight flesh clinging to its skeletal frame, showing the bones beneath in stark relief. Its body seems to tremble and shake as it moves, yet the Black Horse remains hearty and healthy despite this apparent malnutrition.</p>
<p>The Black Horse has the following specific abilities in addition to those detailed previously.</p>

This is a curse effect.</p>
<p class="title">The Pale Horse of Death
<p>The Pale Horse of Charon is the Horse of Death. Its body looks long-dead; its flesh is tinged green with mold and decay and pocked with holes that allow the bones within to show through.</p>
<p>The Pale Horse has the following specific abilities in addition to those detailed previously.</p>
<p>Additional Spell-Like Abilities</p>

A creature that takes damage from this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> also gains 1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative level</a>.</p>
<p>This is a death effect.</p>
<p class="title">The Red Horse of War
<p>The Red Horse of Szuriel is the Horse of War. It appears hearty and fit and almost as a living horse (unlike the other three apocalypse horsesâ appearances), though it is soaked in blood and covered in gore. Often, the Red Horse manifests horrific and gory wounds on its body, but these wounds are entirely cosmetic and do not weaken the Red Horse at all.</p>
<p>The Red Horse has the following specific abilities in addition to those detailed on the facing page.</p>
<p>Additional Spell-Like Abilities</p>

This is a pain effect.</p>
<p class="title">The White Horse of Pestilence
<p>The White Horse of Apollyon is the Horse of Pestilence.</p>
<p>Its body looks filthy and festering, covered with foul pusdripping sores and rancid boils squirming with maggots.</p>

<h1>False Spider, Pedipalp</h1>
<p class="description">This creature looks like a cross between a spider and a scorpion. It has six legs and two thin antennae that constantly writhe and wriggle. Two large scorpion-like pincers protrude from just in front of its foremost legs, and a whip-like tail extends from the end of its abdomen.</p>

<p>False spiders are spider-like creatures that are very aggressive and highly predatory in nature, often hunting at night when the element of surprise is theirs to be had. False spiders dwell in shallow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>s which the dig with their massive pincers. There are two kinds of false spiders: pedipalps and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/false-spider-solifugid">solifugids</a>.</p>

<p>A rare variety of the common pedipalp exists. Rarely encountered, the poisonous pedipalp is a solitary creature. No more than one has ever been encountered at a given time. They do not associate with others of their kind or with normal pedipalps. The poisonous pedipalp uses the same statistics as the normal pedipalp with the additions below. The poisonous pedipalp is CR 3.</p>
<h5>Poison Cloud (Ex)</h5>
<p>When threatened, a poisonous pedipalp releases a cloud of noxious fumes in a 20-foot radius around its body. Living creatures within the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d6 rounds. The poisonous pedipalp can use this cloud three times per day. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/delay-poison">delay poison</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a> spell removes the effect from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.</p>

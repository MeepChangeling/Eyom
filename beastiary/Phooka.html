<h1>Phooka</h1>
<p class="description">These small hairy creatures resemble a cross between a goblin and a child’s fuzzy play bear. They have wide set glowing golden eyes and long pointed ears like those of a donkey. They have a mouth to match their ears, complete with buck teeth. </p>

<p>Phookas are tricksters and jokesters. They revel in playing tricks on unwary travelers, leading them on merry chases or getting them lost deep in the forest. They are not necessarily malicious, however some phooka do lean towards evil and murder.</p>
<p>A phooka’s trickery may include turning itself into an enchanted pony and offer a stranger a ride, only to lead it through brambles and thorns at top speed, or to lead travelers to enchanted springs that cause them to fall into deep slumber and strip them of all their belongings and clothes, then leave behind clues as to where their possessions are hidden.</p>
<p>Phooka are deeply attuned to nature and animals and have a bond with their natural surroundings. If slain all plant matter within one square mile of the phooka withers and dies.</p>
<p>A phooka stands about 3 feet.</p>

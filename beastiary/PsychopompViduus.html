<h4><span id="Censor_Su">Censor (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A viduus that strikes a living creature with its quill rewrites memories. The target must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or its memories are affected similarly to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/modify-memory">modify memory</a>. The viduus can rewrite 1 dayâs worth of the targetâs memories with a single strike. The target is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a> for the next 1d4 rounds. A creatureâs memories can be restored by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">lesser restoration</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/modify-memory">modify memory</a>, or similar spells. Memories lost in this manner are copied into one of the numerous tomes protected by the viduus and can be relearned by reading that tome. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Expurgate_Su">Expurgate (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A viduus that strikes an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature with its quill can obliterate that creatureâs memories and rob it of its will to act. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or have all of its memories erased. This renders the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> immobile, as if under the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/halt-undead">halt undead</a>. An intelligent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> can attempt a saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, but unintelligent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> remain halted until the effect is removed by an outside force.</p>
<p>The effect is broken if the halted creature is attacked or takes damage. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Quill_Su">Quill (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A viduusâs quill deals piercing damage and is treated as a light weapon and a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>. It cannot be used by other creatures as anything other than a standard writing quill.</p>
<h4><span id="Transformation_Su">Transformation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A viduus that is reduced to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> transforms. Its cocoon body bursts open, expelling a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> of biting black-and-white <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/centipede">centipedes</a> (same statistics as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/spider/spider-swarm">spider swarm</a>) and a bank of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mind-fog">mind fog</a> (CL 4th) centered on the viduusâs square. A viduus can purposefully transform by spending 3 consecutive full-round actions, in which case it reforms somewhere in Purgatory 1 month later.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or library (3â12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Viduuses occupy the many libraries and scriptoriums of Purgatory, where they catalog the comings and goings of extraordinary souls: their lives, deeds, deaths, and secrets.</p>
<p>Existence holds many mysteries, and those mortals who had brushes with the extraordinary have their tales and confessions recorded by these semi-cocooned scholars and added to the volumes of Purgatoryâs expansive libraries. Although pretentious in the extreme, viduuses prove quite knowledgeable about many historical and <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/planar">planar</a> secrets, and what they donât know they generally have a decent idea of how to research, potentially <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Summoning">summoning</a> assistants from across the planes to aid them.</p>

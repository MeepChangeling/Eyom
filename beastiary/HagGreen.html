<h4><span id="Weakness_Su">Weakness (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A green hag’s claws sap strength from those she strikes. Each time a green hag hits a foe with her claw attack, the victim takes 2 points of Strength damage unless he resists the weakness with a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. Alternatively, a green hag can attempt to inflict even greater weakness on a foe by making a touch attackâthis variant requires a standard action, and cannot be attempted in the same round the hag makes claw attacks. The opponent touched must succeed on a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Mimicry_Ex">Mimicry (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A green hag can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near its lair.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate marshes<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or coven (3 hags of any kind)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Terrifying crones known to haunt foul swamps and tangled forests, green hags harbor an intense hatred for all beauty and purity. Making use of their varied deceptive abilities, these crones delight in murdering innocents, unhinging noble minds, and debasing the pure of heart. They are particularly fond of using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disguise-self" rel="nofollow">disguise self</a> to assume the forms of alluring young maidens and then seducing young men away from their lovers or families. In this form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens with all manner of debauchery and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true natures to their lovers at a moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and do what they can to utterly ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing the broken shell that remains the truth. In the end, the luckiest of these unfortunate lovers end up being eaten by their green hag companionsâfor the unlucky, their final doom can be much worse, for the cruel imagination of the green hag is vast.</p>

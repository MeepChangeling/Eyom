<h4><a name="TOC-Mind-Lash-Su-"></a>Mind Lash (Su)</h4>
<p>Those struck by an irnakurse are overwhelmed with dark emotions and corrupted images of a ruined life. Any non-evil creature hit by an irnakurse’s tentacle must succeed at a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves can’t be affected by the same irnakurse’s mind lash for 24 hours. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Soul-Scream-Su-"></a>Soul Scream (Su)</h4>
<p>Capable of channeling all of its rage and terror into a single, unnatural noise, an irnakurse can unleash a sound of alien horror as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. Any non-evil creature within 30 feet of a screaming irnakurse must succeed at a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or take 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Wisdom drain</a>. Once it begins screaming, an irnakurse can continue as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> for 6 rounds, but can’t scream again for 5 minutes afterward. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<p>Irnakurse, meaning “perfect ones” in the Elven language, represent the sum outpouring of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a> hatred for their surface-world brethren. These brainwashed, rage-filled abominations are the result of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elves</a> subjected to fleshwarpingâand were the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a> to have their way, embodiments of the elven race’s future. Each irnakurse suffers long under the knife of the dark <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elves</a>‘ most practiced fleshwarpers until its body and mind lie in total ruin. When the weeks of torture and transformation are complete, what was once an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elf</a> emerges as a shrieking mockery of its lost grace, a horror of reworked flesh and broken bones, a “perfect” <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf">elf</a> to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a> and a sin against life to elvenkind.</p>
<p>Through the blasphemous tortures that create them, irnakurse are made completely mad and become unable to harm <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a>. All non-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a>, however, they view as targets to vent their terror and rage upon. Elves especially provoke irnakurses’ ire.</p>
<p>No two irnakurse look exactly the sameâ<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a> torturers take profane pride in sculpting their elven victims into unique masterpieces of agonyâmost stand between 8 and 9 feet tall and weigh upward of 300 pounds.</p>

<p>Mome raths are a variety of rath that sniff through the forests of the Fey World, digging up roots and hiding from large predators with a variety of cunning camouflage techniques. When spotted, they are easily identified by their powerful, hunched backs and stout claws. Mature specimens cultivate a garden of moss, algae, and other plants on their backs to retain water, ward off parasites, and help them blend in to their environment, giving them a mottled green coloration. All raths defend themselves with powerful kicks and spurs on their hind legs that are coated with burning venom.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe mome raths to be distant relatives of the pangolinâif only for their similar body structure. While a variety of raths have adapted to the Fey Worldâs strange climates, the mome rath is the most common, climbing through trees to graze on leaves and fruit and raid the occasional bird or snark nest. A healthy mome rath is up to 6 feet long including its muscular tail, and weighs around 100 pounds.</p>

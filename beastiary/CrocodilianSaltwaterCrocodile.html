<h1>Crocodilian, Saltwater Crocodile</h1>
<p class="description">This crocodile is nearly half again as large as a normal crocodile, and seems to smile with its long, toothed mouth as it lunges forward.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Death-Roll-Ex-"></a>Death Roll (Ex)</h4>
<p>When <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> a foe of its size or smaller, a saltwater crocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim.</p>
<p>The crocodile deals its bite damage and knocks the creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>. If successful, the crocodile maintains its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Hold-Breath-Ex-"></a>Hold Breath (Ex)</h4>
<p>A saltwater crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> score before it risks drowning.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Lunging-Bite-Ex-"></a>Lunging Bite (Ex)</h4>
<p>Once per minute, a saltwater crocodile can extend the reach of its bite attack by 5 feet without taking the normal penalties to AC associated with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/lunge-combat">Lunge</a> feat.</p>
<p>This extended reach applies only to the crocodile’s bite attack and lasts until the start of the creature’s next turn.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> tropical coasts and rivers<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or float (3â8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>Native to tropical saltwater estuaries and the freshwater rivers that feed them, saltwater crocodiles are among the largest form of non-primordial crocodilian.</p>
<p>Adult saltwater crocodiles can reach lengths upward of 20 feet and weights of over 2,000 pounds, and are typically more lethargic than their smaller kin, spending their days sunning themselves on land or in shallow water and hunting at night.</p>

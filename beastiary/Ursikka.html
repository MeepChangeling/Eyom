<h4><span id="Coat_Claws_Ex"><a name="TOC-Coat-Claws-Ex-"></a>Coat Claws (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, an ursikka can coat its pincerlike claws with freezing, viscous saliva. This coating lasts for 1 minute. Any creature hit by an ursikka’s coated claws or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> by an ursikka using the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/snatch">Snatch</a> feat takes an additional 2d6 points of cold damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 22 half).</p>
<h4><span id="Freezing_Saliva_Ex"><a name="TOC-Freezing-Saliva-Ex-"></a>Freezing Saliva (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The saliva that drips from an ursikka’s mouth is sticky as well as cold, causing creatures to become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> for 1d4 rounds (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 22 negates). While <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a>, creatures take 2d6 points of cold damage each round. An <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> creature can break free before the end of this duration by succeeding at a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the encasing saliva with either a slashing weapon or fire damage. Using fire to remove the saliva damages the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> creature as well. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Hibernation_Ex"><a name="TOC-Hibernation-Ex-"></a>Hibernation (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An ursikka can enter a prolonged state of hibernation by surrounding itself with its spittle, which hardens into a cocoon.</p>
<p>While hibernating, an ursikka doesn’t need to drink or eat. The cocoon has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 10 and 60 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, and is immune to fire damage. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the ursikka remains unharmed in its hibernation. An ursikka must use its attacks to break free from its cocoon.</p>
<h4><span id="Spit_Ex"><a name="TOC-Spit-Ex-"></a>Spit (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, an ursikka can spit a 60-foot line of its saliva. Creatures in the area take 8d6 points of cold damage and become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a>. A successful DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save halves the damage and negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> condition. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any cold land<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or hive (3â10)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Ursikkas’ white, shaggy fur covers the majority of their bodies, and their three-part maws can open wide enough to swallow a human whole. The freezing, sticky fluid that drips from their gnashing jaws aids this activity even further.</p>
<p>During summers, ursikkas live inside cocoons constructed from their own saliva. In the weeks before the change of seasons, ursikkas choose an inconspicuous localeâsuch as inside cave complexes or even holes of their own constructionâin which to spend the long summer.</p>
<p>The creatures then tirelessly weave their spittle around their bodies until they’re fully covered. In 24 hours, the chemicals in the spittle harden it into an impenetrable sheath that protects ursikkas from brutal summer heat. Shortly after their spittle-cocoons harden, the beasts go dormant and do not awake until the temperature returns to a more tolerable level.</p>
<p>Although ursikkas are known for aggressiveness during the entirety of winter, they are at their most volatile right before and right after dormancy. An ursikka that is interrupted while weaving its cocoon immediately attempts to kill the intruders. An ursikka whose cocoon is broken during the summer emerges similarly enraged; ursikkas that defeat the creatures responsible for waking them attempt to reconstruct their cocoons, but as spittle production ceases during hibernation, those efforts often fail. Some natives actively seek out the cocoons of slumbering ursikkas, knowing they can defeat the exposed beasts relatively easily.</p>
<p>With their ruthless predatory skills and voracious appetites, ursikkas typically live solitary existences. However, in places where prey is abundant, ursikkas sometimes live in pairs or, rarely, in small hives of three to 10. In such cases, ursikkas still hunt alone. Scholars note that the creatures don’t hesitate to kill each other should one steal another’s meal.</p>
<p>In accordance with their long life cycles, ursikkas mate infrequently.</p>
<p>Once or twice each winter, the larger females of the species typically seek out mates as determinedly as they hunt prey. Afterward, each female lays one enormous, fertilized egg made of a secretion similar to the creatures’ hardened saliva. After a 5-year gestation period, the egg hatches. If ursikka parents are even aware of their offspring, though, their behavior does not indicate it.</p>
<p>According to scholars, young ursikkas grow to maturity in fewer than 10 years. One disturbing speculation indicates that adult ursikkas sometimes enjoy the flesh of their younger counterpartsâand may actually hunt juvenile members of their own species if prey becomes scarce. Whether this behavior is simply a way for adult ursikkas to survive or a warped way for them to retain their territorial dominance is unknown.</p>
<p>Although they are very long-lived, ursikkas rarely live through more than two winters. In the planet’s most isolated territories, where few predators or stalwart hunters threaten them, ursikkas typically die of old age during their dormant period; ursikka carcasses swathed in shimmering, deteriorating cocoons are not uncommon in these frontiers. In more populated areas, ursikkas’ lifespans are shorter, especially given the hardy, cold-forged winter cultures that hunt the creatures for protection, thrills, and sometimes meat. Indeed, the warriors of the most populous nations consider a slain ursikkas’ claws, mandibles, and bulbous eyes the ultimate hunting trophies. Some even make furred armor from ursikkas’ durable exoskeletons.</p>

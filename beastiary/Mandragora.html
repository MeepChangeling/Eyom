<p>Once per day as a standard action, a mandragora can give voice to an unsettling shriek. All creatures within a 30-foot spread of a shrieking mandragora must make a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4 rounds.

<h4><span id="Vulnerable_to_Supernatural_Darkness_Ex"><a name="TOC-Vulnerable-to-Supernatural-Darkness-Ex-"></a><b>Vulnerable to Supernatural Darkness (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p>In areas of supernatural darkness (such as those created by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/deeper-darkness"><i>deeper darkness</i></a>, but not by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness"><i>darkness</i></a>), a mandragora is slowed, as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow"><i>slow</i></a> spell.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold or temperate forests<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or grove (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard<br/> </p>
<p>A mandragora rises spontaneously from a mandrake root that has drawn nutrition from the corpse or ichor of a demon. A typical mandragora stands at just over 3 feet tall and only weighs 30 pounds. However, its size hides the creatureâs fantastic strength and brutality. When a mandragora attacks, its fingers grow into whipping, thorny vines nearly 10 feet long, with which it makes its slam attacks.</p>
<p>A mandragora rarely strays far from its lair amid tangled roots or vines, but when it encounters any other creature, it attacks regardless of the odds. However, a mandragora can usually recognize druids and does not attack them or their animal companions unless they attack it first. It has no qualms about attacking a druidâs allies.</p>
<p>When mandragora poison is mixed with its thick, gooey, sap-like blood and 1,000 gp worth of alchemical reagents, the resulting fluid can be used as a focus for the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/scrying"><i>scrying</i></a> spell. The fluid only lasts for the duration of the spellâs casting time and resulting effects but the subject of the spell takes a â4 penalty on the save to resist it.</p>
<p>A mandrake root that is growing on or near a demonâs corpse or ichor has a 2% chance of awakening as a mandragora within a day of first absorbing the tainted material. A creature that wants to create a mandragora can do so with alchemy; the process requires a day of work, a mandrake root, several pints of ichor or the body of a demon of CR 6 or above, and a successful DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) check. The newly created mandragora is hostile, even to its creator.</p>

<h1>Golem, Sand</h1>
<p class="description">This towering creature appears to be made entirely of sand, with pockets of soft earth and rock reinforcing its tall, humanoid form.</p>

<h4><span id="Clutching_Sands_Ex">Clutching Sands (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a creature hits a sand golem with a manufactured melee weapon, the sand golem can make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a> attempt as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>. This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a> attempt doesnât provoke an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check is a success, the weapon is caught in the golemâs churning sands. A sand golemâs body can contain any number of weapons. A sand golem can make an attack with one captured weapon of its choice as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> or as part of its full attack, although <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a> made with captured weapons take a â4 penalty. After attacking twice with a weapon, the weapon falls to the ground, landing 1d4 squares away from the sand golem.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A sand golem is immune to spells and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> that allow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/aqueous-orb">aqueous orb</a> spell deals lethal damage instead of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage">nonlethal damage</a> to a sand golem â¢ A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hydraulic-torrent">hydraulic torrent</a> spell gains a +5 bonus on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check as the torrent surges through a sand golem.</li>
<li><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/soften-earth-and-stone">Soften earth and stone</a> causes a sand golem to lose its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> for 3 rounds.</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transmute-mud-to-rock">transmute mud to rock</a> spell slows a sand golem (as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a>) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transmute-rock-to-mud">transmute rock to mud</a> spell restores 1d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> per level of the caster to a sand golem (maximum 10d6).</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Sand_Blast_Su">Sand Blast (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> once every 1d4 rounds, a sand golem can expel a 15-foot cone of fiery sand from its chest. Creatures struck by the blast take 4d6 points of fire damage and 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save takes half damage and negates the blindness. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p>A sand golem is an animate mass of living sand, soft earth, and rocks.</p>
<p>Enterprising <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerers</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a> have come into great fortune by utilizing sand golems to collect ancient relics from hidden tombs and newly discovered ruins deep in the parched desert dunes. With their ability to withstand the blazing temperatures of the desert sun, these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golems</a> are perfect scouts and retrievers.</p>
<p>Additionally, sand golems make for stalwart sentinels of precious locations such as a masterâs lair or curious locales that require in-person research from their masters.</p>
<p>Sand golems, like other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, obey their creatorsâ commands to the best of their ability. Should the creator die, or should the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> commands be unattainable, the sand golem goes rogue. The creature is still completely functional, but it follows no commands or orders from anyone. Over the course of time, many sand <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golems</a> have gone rogue.</p>
<p>Though sand golems are usually encountered alone, particularly demanding tasks might cause their masters to send a gang of sand golems to complete the mission.</p>
<p>A sand golem is 10 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Variants">Variants</span></h3>
<h4><span id="Gravel_Golem_2_CR">Gravel Golem (+2 CR)</span></h4>
<p>Golem crafters in places lacking fine sand used similar techniques to create a golem formed from larger particles. These golems are often bulkier and more devastating than sand golems. A gravel golem gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/advanced-creature-cr-1">advanced simple template</a>, but its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score isnât increased. In addition, its slams deal 2d10 points of damage and its sand blast special attack deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage in addition to the fire damage. A gravel golem costs an additional 5,000 gp to create.</p>
<h4><span id="Quicksand_Golem_0_CR">Quicksand Golem (+0 CR)</span></h4>
<p>Designed for nondesert climates and specifically for dealing with large areas of people, a quicksand golem loses its blistering sand blast attack. Instead, every 1d6 rounds the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> can create a 10-foot-square area of quicksand within 50 feet of itself. The quicksand golem can create quicksand only in  <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Bonus-Natural-Armor-">natural</a>, unworked terrain, and created patches of quicksand remain active for 10 minutes before vanishing. Creatures still stuck in the quicksand after this duration are immediately shunted to the normal surface of the terrain in which the quicksand was created. The quicksand golem can maintain only three active patches of quicksand at a time. A quicksand golem costs an additional 2,500 gp to create.</p>
<h3><span id="Construction">Construction</span></h3>
<p>The construction of a sand golem requires soft earth and sand that weighs at least 1,500 pounds, as well as rare magical minerals worth 3,500 gp.</p>

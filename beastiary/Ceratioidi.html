<h1>Ceratioidi</h1>
<p class="description">This flabby, fish-like humanoid has the wide mouth, bulging eyes, and dangling, luminescent flesh lure of a deep-sea predator.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, a ceratioidi can light the dangling lure on its forehead, forcing all non-ceratioidi within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated">fascinated</a> for 1 round. Regardless of the preceding interaction between the ceratioidi and its target, a creature affected by this ability does not view the ceratioidi who has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated">fascinated</a> it as a potential threat until that ceratioidi actually attacksâallowing it to approach without breaking the fascination. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to the same ceratioidi’s lure ability for 24 hours. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<p>Ceratioidi have rudimentary lungs capable of breathing air indefinitely, but their skin must be bathed in salt water regularly or it begins drying out painfully. They can go for a number of hours equal to twice their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> score (30 hours for most ceratioidi) before they need to be bathed in salt waterâif they don’t, they take 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> per hour. Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> accrued is reversed after they spend at least 10 minutes immersed in salt water.</p>
<p>Rulers of the deep ocean trenches, ceratioidi are powerful, intelligent humanoids who share several unusual traits with the aquatic predators of the ceratiidae family, also known as angler fish. From their strange, spired cities beneath the waves, ceratioidi cast their nets of influence far and wide, using their alien intelligence, natural affinity for magic, and hypnotizing lures to manipulate other creatures throughout the oceansâand beyond.</p>
<p>Rulers of the deep ocean trenches, ceratioidi are powerful, intelligent humanoids who share several unusual traits with the aquatic predators of the ceratiidae family, also known as angler fish. From their strange, spired cities beneath the waves, ceratioidi cast their nets of influence far and wide, using their alien intelligence, natural affinity for magic, and hypnotizing lures to manipulate other creatures throughout the worldâs oceansâand beyond. </p>
<p> In addition to their dual nature, ceratioidi share a number of other intimidating characteristics with their angler fish cousins. Along with its wide mouth full of inward-curving, needle-sharp teeth, a ceratioidi also possesses the angler fishâs fleshy forehead lure, called an esca. This bioluminescent blob dangles at the end of thin spine just above eye level and is the focus for the ceratioidiâs innate hypnotic abilities. Through this lure, the ceratioidi can paralyze foes in combat, forcing them to stand still or approach and be culled by the ceratioidiâs barbed fishing spear; it can even hypnotize creatures so thoroughly as to make them susceptible to subliminal commands. This ability to manipulate others, combined with the immobile maleâs natural affinity for magical study and other deeply contemplative arts, makes the ceratioidi masters of their surroundings. </p>
<p> Though almost all ceratioidi encountered outside of their homes are fully mated pairs, unmated females can be represented by removing the dual mind ability from the creatureâs stat block. Males can be simulated by using the statistics for an electric eel without the electricity special ability. </p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p> Because they normally construct their cities on the floors of deep ocean trenches or near mineral-rich underwater vents, ceratioidi are rarely encountered by terrestrial races, and little is known about their society. The ceratioidi, with their manipulative magic and ability to exist on land for long stretches of time, make perfect gobetweens and bureaucrats for the strange kingdom. </p>
<p>Though the ceratioidi are rumored by many to be a product of aboleth experimentation, the ceratioidi believe differently. They believe themselves to be the direct descendents of their god, an immense and omnipotent angler fish that accompanied them on their journey and now resides in the flooded caverns.</p>

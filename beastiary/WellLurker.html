<p>These creatures make their homes in crevasses and carved dungeon pits. This creature has developed a keen natural camouflage making them appear as a freshwater well carved into subterranean lairs. The entire well is in fact the beast with tentacles and devouring mouth drawn five feet beneath a rocky collar which protrudes from the ground.</p>
<p>Well lurkers are opportunistic and passive hunters, rarely seeking out their meals; they simply wait for something to wander too close to them and then strike. If food becomes scarce or the area around a well lurker’s lair becomes devoid of life, it uproots itself and moves to a new location. Such occurrences are rare however as the well lurker can go months without eating (and its rare for caves and caverns to go months without being explored by adventurer types).</p>
<p>A typical well lurker covers a 10-foot area, though specimens covering as much as a 30-foot area have been reported. A well lurker’s tentacles are deep brown in color and about 10 feet long (longer on larger specimens). Its maw is dark brown and ringed with many small tentacles. It can draw its grasping tentacles into its form and fold its mouth tentacles backwards inside its maw, thus appearing for all intents and purposes as an ancient stone well.</p>
<p>Animals can detect the unnatural presence of a well lurker and are generally nervous in its presence. Unless forced, an animal does not approach closer than 10 feet to this creature.</p>

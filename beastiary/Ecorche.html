<p>Whenever an ecorche damages a target with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Rend-Ex-">rend</a> ability, the target must succeed at a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to resist being skinned alive. Those who fail the save become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> and take 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Constitution drain</a> per round. Both of these effects are permanent but can be removed with a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate">regenerate</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal">heal</a> spell (or 1 round of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a>). The ecorche can use its wear skin ability to don a skin stolen in this way as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Wear_Skin_Su"><a name="TOC-Wear-Skin-Su-"></a>Wear Skin (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An ecorche can steal the skin of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> Small, Medium, or Large <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> and wear it as its own. When it does this, the ecorche takes on the creature’s size and appearance and gains a +10 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> checks made to impersonate the victim. While wearing a stolen skin, an ecorche cannot use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Frightful-Presence-Ex-">frightful presence</a>. This stolen skin is preserved while the ecorche wears it, but is destroyed if the ecorche takes more than 10 points of damage or if the ecorche chooses to destroy the skin as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. Those within 60 feet who see an ecorche’s stolen skin destroyed are immediately subjected to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Frightful-Presence-Ex-">frightful presence</a> and take a -5 penalty on the related <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. An ecorche reverts to its normal size if its stolen skin is destroyed.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or gang (2-4)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>An ecorche stands approximately 8-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 600 pounds.</p>

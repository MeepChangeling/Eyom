<h1>First Blade</h1>
<p class="description">The sound of clashing steel upon a battlefield resounds with every step of this ironclad giant. Its armor bears harsh but elaborate flourishes, as though it were the war regalia of some merciless warlord. Each plate looks impossibly thick and heavy, like the hulking titan within is completely hidden by layer upon layer of tightly woven chain and impregnable steel.</p>

<h4><span id="Bladed_Slam_Ex"><a name="TOC-Bladed-Slam-Ex-"></a>Bladed Slam (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The First Blade’s slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.</p>
<p>Its slams count as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> or manufactured weapons (whichever is most beneficial to it) for the purpose of spells that enhance attacks, and as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Chaotic">chaotic</a>, and magic for the purpose of overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> and bypassing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Ironsense_Ex"><a name="TOC-Ironsense-Ex-"></a>Ironsense (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The First Blade automatically detects iron objects within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Su"><a name="TOC-Immunity-to-Magic-Su-"></a>Immunity to Magic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The First Blade has the same <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to magic as an iron <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a>. It can lower this <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resistance">resistance</a> for 1 round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Lord_of_Battle_Ex"><a name="TOC-Lord-of-Battle-Ex-"></a>Lord of Battle (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The First Blade is proficient in all weapons, and counts as an 18th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian">barbarian</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighter</a> for the purposes of all prerequisites.</p>
<h4><span id="Rage_Aura_Su"><a name="TOC-Rage-Aura-Su-"></a>Rage Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Willing creatures within 100 feet of the First Blade gain the effects of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-">rage</a> automatically, whether they are allies or enemies of the herald. Those who choose not to be affected are immune to the aura until they leave the area and return.</p>
<h4><span id="Swarm_Form_Su"><a name="TOC-Swarm-Form-Su-"></a>Swarm Form (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The herald can transform into a floating swarm of Tiny sharp metal fragments. In this form it has the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> subtype, cannot make slam attacks, gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Distraction-Ex-">distraction</a> ability (DC 28), and can make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> attack that deals 4d6 points of slashing damage to its targets.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any battle<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard </p>
<p>The appearance of the First Blade changes to match a style of armor impressive to those against whom it will be doing battle, though typically notched as if it has been employed in numerous battles. Rarely seen in the same form twice, its plate mail form might vary from the elegant mail of angelic hosts to slabs of spiked iron over thick bestial hides more common to orc warlords. Whatever the shape, the interior of the armor is never visible. Those who have come close enough to the First Blade and survived claim that only more layers of armor lie beneath its plates, though the hint of something glowing within sometimes spills forth should the herald suffer a rare but occasional wound. Regardless of the specifics of its warlike form, the herald typically stands about 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 2 tons.</p>
<h4><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h4>
<p>Although a living creature, the First Blade is little more than a weapon, knowing little beyond its lordâs command and going only where he wills. Like a golem in many respects, the herald leaves but scant traces upon the lands it passes through between battles, eating little and having no need even to breathe. In war, however, its presence and passage are obvious, marked by rent bodies and blood-soaked earth.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society">Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>While the herald of battle answers the call of servants of the lord of battle who seek their lordâs intervention in appropriately glorious battle, no accounts exist of the First Blade responding to any summons involving a task other than combat. Most accounts of the herald tell of the gory swaths it cuts through battlefields of heroes, in clashes between titanic armies, or in weeks-long battles between historyâs greatest warlords. Rumors among the god of battle’s clergy also suggest that sometimes the herald appears when summoned to a lesser battle, but upon finding a mere skirmish or clash among weaklings, it slaughters all involved. Whether such an end is an honor or a disgrace for those killed remains a subject of some debate among theologians.</p>

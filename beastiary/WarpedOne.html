<p>A warped one’s body constantly shifts and changes as raw Abyssal energies course through it, reshaping and rebuilding it in minor but hideous ways. Once a warped one enters combat, these growing energies begin to alter its statistics in small ways. At the start of a warped one’s turn, roll on the following table to see what additional effect its fleshwarping has on it for that roundâall of the following mutations have a duration of 1 round unless otherwise noted.</p>

<h4><span id="Insanity_Ex"><a name="TOC-Insanity-Ex-"></a>Insanity (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A warped one’s mind is completely unhinged, a raw chaos of madness. It uses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves instead of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> modifier, and it is immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effects. Any attempt to contact a warped one telepathically (including using spells like <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a>) produces a backlash effect, dealing 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> to the one attempting the contact. A DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save negates this effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Unstable_Summoning_Sp"><a name="TOC-Unstable-Summoning-Sp-"></a>Unstable Summoning (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A warped one can rend the boundaries between worlds to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Summon-Sp-">summon</a> creatures to aid it in combat, but it has little control over what sorts of monsters or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a> respond to its summonings. When a warped one uses its unstable <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Summoning">summoning</a>, there’s a 50% chance that a creature (or a group of creatures) arrives to aid the warped one. Creatures summoned in this way are immune to that particular warped one’s warp field. To determine the nature of the summoned aid, roll on the table below. This is a 5th-level spell effect.</p>

<h4><span id="Warp_Field_Su"><a name="TOC-Warp-Field-Su-"></a>Warp Field (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A warped one exudes a field of mental and physical entropic energy to a radius of 30 feet that twists and warps the minds and bodies of all other living creatures.</p>
<p>Creatures who begin their turn inside of a warp field must succeed at a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. Failure indicates that the creature is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a> for 1 round and suffers one mutation from the table below. These mutations emerge swiftly and painfully, causing the victim to become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1 round and to gain one random mutation from the following table for 1 round. Once a creature succeeds at its saving throw against a warp field, it is immune to further effects from that specific warped one’s warp field for 24 hours. This is a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph">polymorph</a> effect.

<p><b>Environment</b> any (Abyss)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or mob (3â14)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Demons form from the interaction of sinful human souls upon the fecundity of the Abyss itself, but this is not the only way the demonic plane creates life. In certain parts of this blasphemous realm, non-sinful souls or even living humanoids can be overwhelmed and transformed into demon-like creatures. So powerful are the energies corrupting and warping these humanoids that chaotic force continues to leak from their creations and continuously affect the creatures’ fleshâforever twisting and mutating them in endless agony. These poor victims have been transformed into warped ones.</p>
<p>No two warped ones look exactly alike, although they all share certain common features. They always appear as two to four demonic humanoids awkwardly fused together into a single human-sized monstrosity. While they can have several limbs, they always have four that sport particularly sharp talons. Once a warped one enters combat, the excitement of imminent bloodshed (both that of its victims and of itself ) causes the entropic energies within it to change and mutate. A fight against a warped one is a harrowing experience, for not only do the warped one’s physical traits change continuously, these mutations affect and cripple those nearby in devastating ways.</p>
<p>As using a warped one in combat adds lots of additional dice rolls to encounters, you may want to âsynchronizeâ their fleshwarping and warp-field abilities when using multiple warped ones in battles, so each round they all exhibit the same trait and their warp fields all have the same effect.</p>
<p>A warped one is 7 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds.</p>

<p>Giant marmosets are larger, more aggressive relatives of the smaller marmoset. Their fur is gray or black, with black fur predominant over the back and neck. Their tails reach a length of 5 feet and are colored in alternating bands of black and pale gray. They sustain themselves on a diet of tree saps and gums (using their sharp teeth to gnaw holes in the bark), small animals, and various fruits and nuts. Giant marmosets make their homes among the trees, rarely touching the ground unless hunting living prey. They are, on occasion, tamed by wild tribes of halflings and used as mounts in times of war.</p>
<p>Giant marmosets prefer to attack from surprise, tossing large stones from the sides of cliffs at their prey, hanging from branches by their tail and swinging down to surprise their prey, or dropping from the trees on their unaware foes. They attack using their claws and bite or claws and a tail slap.</p>

<h1>Ercinee</h1>
<p class="description">Beating its powerful wings, this massive multicolored bird circles purposefully. Its eyes are pits of greenish flame and its radiant feathers cause it to soar in stark relief against the comparably dull sky.</p>

<p>If provoked, an ercinee begins combat by using its unstable screech and then seeks out confused foes and uses searing light and flyby attacks until they are no longer threats. Ercinee will not fight to the death. If reduced below 10 hit points, an ercinee flees.</p>

<p>At will, an ercinee can shed drops of luminous fluid from its wings. This liquid falls behind it as it flies, with one droplet falling every 25 feet. Where these droplets land, the area within 5 feet is lit by shadowy illumination. This fluid lasts for I hour, after which it evaporates to nothing.</p>

<p>At night, an ercinee sheds light as the spell daylight. It can suppress or reactivate this ability as a free action.</p>
<h4><span id="Unstable_Screech_Su">Unstable Screech (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An ercinee can, as a standard action, emit a shrill and bewildering screech. Any creature within 30 feet of the ercinee must make a DC 17 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. Creatures who succeed at this save cannot be affected again by the same ercinee’s screech for 24 hours. Creatures already confused take a -2 penalty on their save to resist additional unstable screeches. The save DC is Wisdom-based.</p>

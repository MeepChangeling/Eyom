<h1>Karz Slug</h1>
<p class="title">Karz Slug <span class="level">CR 9</span></p>
<p class="description">A gelatinous slug umber in hue and covered in amber slime, this creature is patterned with a symmetrical array of hardened nodules. Several dangerous-looking calcified horns protrude outward from both of its tapered ends, making it nearly impossible to tell which end is which. A series of bulbous suckers cover the slugâs underside and surround a wide, fleshy maw that twitches and extrudes more of the viscous mucus that envelops this weird gastropod.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Karz slugs hide and use their collective memories with psionic camouflage and psionic lure to draw prey close.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Karz slugs work together to kill off their prey, usually attacking any opponents that carry fire first, followed by enemies they perceive to be weakest.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Karz slugs fight to the death when within their breeding pen, but otherwise flee when they no longer outnumber their enemies.</p>

<h4><span id="Den_Haste_Ex">Den Haste (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When encountered within a karz slug breeding den, a karz slugs gains the benefits of a constant extraordinary effect identical to the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Karz_Slime_Ex">Karz Slime (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Karz slugs are covered in a thick layer of translucent amber slime. A karz slug can spit slime as a ranged attack at a target up to 60 ft. way, or slather slime with a successful melee attack (as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>). Karz slime is a fast acting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> and is immediately absorbed into a creatureâs skin upon contact. The slime remains poisonous for four rounds after a creature comes into contact with it and at the start of its turn a creature affected by it must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw to negate its effects. After four rounds the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> is neutralized and the karz slime is annoying but harmless.</p>
<p>For the initial two rounds of exposure the slime causes amnesia (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 20), for the last two effective rounds exposure to the slime causes paranoia (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 17). If a target fails any of these saving throws it remains affected by the relevant slime effects until the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> is cured by magical means such as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a> spell. If a target is affected by any of these effects for longer than 24 hours they also suffer from psychosis (no saving throw; insanity DC 20) until the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> is cured by magical means. If a target is affected by any of these effects for longer than a week, the effects become permanent.</p>
<h4><span id="Lunge_Ex">Lunge (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slugâs lunge attack has a reach of 15 feet.</p>
<p>After a lunge attack the karz slug moves from its previous square to the square nearest its intended target. This movement is considered a part of its attack and not factored into its movement rate.</p>
<h4><span id="Malleable_Ex">Malleable (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slugâs body is very malleable, allowing it to fit into narrow areas with ease. A karz slug takes no penalties to its speed or checks when squeezing in an area that is one size category smaller than its actual size.</p>
<h4><span id="Psionic_Camouflage_Su">Psionic Camouflage (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slug has the ability to project itself (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a>) as an environmental element. This is a psionic mind-altering effect (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 25). Karz slugs most commonly use this ability to hide themselves when they flee from combat.</p>
<h4><span id="Psionic_Lure_Su">Psionic Lure (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slug has the ability to project itself (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a>) as any other Medium-sized creature it has encountered. This is a psionic mind-altering effect (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 25). As an intelligent creature a karz slug can tell the difference between various creatures, and may choose to work together with other karz slugs to manifest a projected scenario that is more likely to attract prey. While karz slugs do not understand language, their projections can repeat phrases in any language that have been overheard.</p>
<h4><span id="Susceptible_to_Heat_Ex">Susceptible to Heat (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slug takes double damage from fire. Its slime is semi-flammable and has a 15% chance of combustion if exposed to an open flame. If a karz slugâs slime ignites, it kills that slug immediately.</p>
<p>If exposed to excessive heat or fire there is a 10% chance that a karz slug instinctively flees for 2d4 rounds.</p>
<h4><span id="Susceptible_to_Salt_Ex">Susceptible to Salt (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A handful of salt burns a karz slug as if it were a flask of acid, causing 1d6 points of damage per handful.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground<br/><b>Organization</b> brood (6-18), breeding den (18-54)<br/><b>Treasure</b> unique (karz slug gland)</p>
<p>Karz slugs are rarely found alone; when separated from their kin they become withdrawn and docile, fleeing at the first opportune moment. However in groups they are quite vicious and committed to killing and consuming other creatures en masse. Extremely little is known of karz slugs and none have ever endured capture for very long.</p>
<p>A karz slug is almost 7 feet long and weighs between 150 and 200 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Karz_Slug_Glands">Karz Slug Glands</span></h3>
<p>A karz slug has a gland located near its core that enables its natural psionic abilities. If removed from the dead slug, dried, and properly prepared (DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> [magic items] check that takes 48 hours) it becomes an enchanted consumable. Once properly prepared and eaten, karz slug glands provides <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to all mind-altering effects and a +3 bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throws for 24 hours. This includes any mind-altering status effects that the user may have been affected by before consumption. The taste of a prepared karz slug gland is eye-wateringly sour and bitter.</p>

<h1>Lizardfolk, Fungal</h1>
<p class="description">This tall creature looks like a cross between a powerfully built human and a lizard, but its body is bloated, white, and spotted with mushroom caps and shelf fungus. It has clawed hands, a long, mushroom-studded tail, and toothy jaws.</p>

<p>Fungal lizardfolk save their poison spore clouds until several creatures are within range. When they can catch multiple creatures in their spores, they attempt to kill the weaker ones in order to create more of their kind.</p>

<p> SPECIAL QUALITIES 
<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Ex"><a name="TOC-Create-Spawn-Ex-"></a>Create Spawn (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="margin-left:0px">The body of a creature killed by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> damage from a fungal creatureâs spore cloud is slowly transformed into a fungal creature. This transformation takes at least 1 full day, but particularly dry conditions can extend the process for up to a week (GMâs discretion). Once fully converted, the corpse cannot be raised from the dead, but it can still be resurrected or reincarnated. The application of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-growth"><i>plant growth</i></a> spell halves the transformation time, and the application of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/diminish-plants"><i>diminish plants</i></a> spell doubles it. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight"><i>blight</i></a> spell destroys the fungal spores and prevents transformation of the corpse. Spells that remove disease are ineffective against the spores.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px">The fungal creature lacks the class levels and memories of the creature from which it gained its form. If the base creature has 1 or fewer racial HD and is normally presented as classed (as with most humanoids), use a 1st-level warrior version of it as the base creature. The fungal creature awakens as a free-willed being knowing all it needs to know (including language) in order to use its abilities and survive. Although it bears no allegiance to the fungal creature that created it, the new fungal creature immediately recognizes other fungal creatures as its own kind.</p>
<h4><span id="Hold_Breath_Ex"><a name="TOC-Hold-Breath-Ex-"></a><b>Hold Breath (Ex)</b><br/> </span></h4> A lizardfolk can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its 
 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> score before it risks drowning. 
 <h4><span id="Poison_Spore_Cloud_Ex"><a name="TOC-Poison-Spore-Cloud-Ex-"></a>Poison Spore Cloud (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="margin-left:0px">Once per day, a fungal creature can release a choking yellow cloud of spores in a 15-foot-radius spread. The spore cloud lingers visibly in the air for 10 rounds, but it dissipates normally on the wind. This cloud functions as an inhaled poison.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px">Any creature that does not hold its breath before the fungal creature activates this ability is assumed to inhale the spores. Each breathing creature in the cloud must succeed on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save (DC 10 + 1/2 fungal creature HD + fungal creatureâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> modifier) or take 1d2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> damage and be fatigued for 1 minute. Thereafter, the creature must succeed on a second save (whether or not it succeeded on the first) or take 1d2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> damage and become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued" rel="nofollow">fatigued</a> (or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted" rel="nofollow">exhausted</a> if already <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued" rel="nofollow">fatigued</a>).</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px">A creature that continues to inhale the spores continues to make <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saves against their effects. Multiple spore clouds from multiple fungal creatures require multiple saves from any creature in an area where the clouds overlap. Creatures that are immune to poisons are immune to the fungal creatureâs poison spore cloud.</p>
<h4><span id="Poisonous_Blood_Ex"><a name="TOC-Poisonous-Blood-Ex-"></a>Poisonous Blood (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="margin-left:0px">A fungal creatureâs blood and flesh function as ingested poisons. Any creature that makes a bite attack against a fungal creature, swallows one whole, or otherwise ingests part of one must succeed on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save (DC 10 + 1/2 fungal creature HD + fungal creatureâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> modifier) or take 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> damage and 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> damage. One minute later, the creature must make a second save at the same DC or be nauseated for 1 minute and take 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> damage and 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> damage.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px">A fungal creature can drain its own blood to procure an ingested poison that affects creatures as described above. Unfortunately, its blood has a distinctive and largely unwelcome smell and taste, so most intelligent creatures would not eat food tainted with it unless the taste were thoroughly disguised (a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession">Profession</a> [cook] check). The fungal creature must deal at least 1 point of damage to itself to get a full dose of poison, and the drawn blood (or amputated flesh) retains its poisonous nature for just 1 day unless additional living fungal blood is mixed into it.</p>
<h4><span id="Fungal_Metabolism_Ex"><a name="TOC-Fungal-Metabolism-Ex-"></a>Fungal Metabolism (Ex)</span></h4>
<p style="margin-left:0px">Fungal creatures do not breathe, nor do they need to eat or sleep in the typical manner. They gain all the sustenance they require from contact with moist natural earth, but they require rejuvenation (see Rejuvenation) as often and for as long as humans need sleep.</p>
<h4><span id="Rejuvenation_Ex"><a name="TOC-Rejuvenation-Ex-"></a>Rejuvenation (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>So long as it is in contact with moist natural earth, a resting fungal creature regains hit points as though it were experiencing complete bed rest and long term care (3 hit points per character level for each day of rest). The fungal creature can engage in light activity during rejuvenation, but any strenuous activity (fighting, running, casting a spell, and so on) prevents it from regaining hit points for that day. Complete bed rest does not increase the amount of healing a fungal creature gains from rejuvenation.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a fungal creature using a lizardfolk as the base creature. This tall creature looks like a cross between a powerfully built human and a lizard, but its body is bloated, white, and spotted with mushroom caps and shelf fungus. It has clawed hands, a long, mushroom-studded tail, and toothy jaws.</p>
<p>Fungal lizardfolk live in marshes far from most civilizations. However, their conflicts with other marsh dwellers at spawning time sometimes drive them out of their normal territories and into more civilized realms in search of easier prey. Fungal lizardfolk speak Draconic and Sylvan.</p>

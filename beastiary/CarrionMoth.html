<p>The flapping wings of a carrion moth emit a mind-numbing drone that affects all creatures within 80 feet that hear it. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a> for 2d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same carrion mothâs drone attack for 24 hours.

<p>When a carrion moth dies, its carcass splits open and releases a foul-smelling gas.

<p>The carrion moth is believed by sages to be an advanced form of a slime crawler. Just as the caterpillar grows into a moth, sages believe the mature slime crawler eventually sheds its form and transforms into the carrion moth. No cocoon or evidence has been found to support this theory, but it is widely accepted among the more learned sages of the world.</p>
<p>The carrion moth is a large moth-like creature growing to a maximum length of 20 feet. Its wings are lined with tiny holes and veins that allow the carrion moth to emit a whining drone that affects all creatures that hear it. Carrion moths are attracted to the stench of decaying flesh and the light of anything larger than a torch or lantern.</p>
<p>A carrion moth attacks by biting with its mandibles and slapping with its tentacles. Paralyzed creatures are carried off and devoured.</p>

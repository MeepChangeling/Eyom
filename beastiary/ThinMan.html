<h1>Thin Man</h1>
<p class="description">The creature is unbelievably slender and has teeth filed to points. Its long, gangly arms end in hands with wickedly sharp nails.</p>

This gives it a +20 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks and the ability to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-advanced-talents/hide-in-plain-sight-ex">hide in plain sight</a> for 1 round per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> even when there is no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a>, or shadow nearby. If it makes an attack, the thin man is no longer in its vanished state. It usually uses this ability when attempting to elude pursuit.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm plains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or band (3â8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The mysterious thin men have long been a part of legend. They inhabited their tiny island home long before <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> colonists first arrived, and the so-called thin men have lived on the periphery of society or among the indigenous cane fields since times long forgotten. Their natural coloration and slender frames serve particularly well in concealing them from the prying eyes of suspicious humans.</p>
<p>The thin men use their naturally hard and sharp claws to dig narrow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>s beneath the fields and copses of the island. Their bodies have few bonesâinstead, their skeletal frameworks are almost entirely cartilaginous in nature, which allows them to navigate their tiny <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>s with relative ease and escape the notice of their human neighbors. Their close connection with the earth likewise gives them immunity to natural toxins.</p>
<p>Though the thin men generally keep to themselves, only observing their human counterparts from the shadows, on occasion they tire of the meager fare of plant roots, grubs, and small vermin on which they normally subsist, and catch a local farmer alone in his fields or traveling at night. On these occasions, they murder the hapless victim and feast on his remains. Their uncanny ability to hide in the endless waving fields of cane lets them avoid the patrols or posses of vengeful farmers that come around to search for the killer.</p>

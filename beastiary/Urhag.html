<h1>Urhag</h1>
<p class="description">This bat-like creatureâs body is mostly a large, toothy maw, held aloft by leathery wings. Its whip-thin tail ends in a slender stinger.</p>

<h4><span id="Gnaw_into_Flesh_Ex">Gnaw into Flesh (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When the urhag grapples a creature, it gnaws into that creatureâs flesh, eventually hollowing it out to serve as a host. An urhag that grapples a foe and chooses to damage the foe with an additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check deals twice its normal bite damage (2d6+6 for most urhags) plus 2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Strength damage</a> as it consumes the victimâs muscle and sinew.</p>
<h4><span id="Infest_Flesh_Su">Infest Flesh (Su)</span></h4>
<p>If the urhag kills a Medium or larger creature it is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a>, it slithers into the creatureâs body as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, sliding its tendrils into the victimâs limbs and controlling the body like a puppet. This functions similarly to a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/possession">greater possession</a> spell, except that the creature uses the urhagâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> instead of its own, and the urhagâs tail emerges from the hostâs mouth like a blistered tongue, allowing it to make sting attacks. If the host body is slain, the urhag emerges as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> but is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round. Otherwise, this effect lasts for 3 days or until the urhag emerges as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. When the effect ends or the urhag emerges, the corpse collapses into rotten scraps of infected flesh. Anyone who touches these scraps is exposed to red plague. An urhag can infest a recently <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> body (one killed within an hour) with 3 full rounds of gnawing.</p>
<h4><span id="Red_Plague_Ex">Red Plague (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Whenever an urhag hits with its sting attack, it inflicts a hideous infection. Creatures suffering from red plague quickly develop large, red, pus-leaking blisters across their bodies; when a creature dies of red plague, all of these blisters pop at once, each releasing a tadpole-sized larval urhag. Red plague is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> effect.</p>
<p>Red Plague: Stingâinjury; <em>save</em> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 15; <em>onset</em> 1 day; <em>frequency</em> 1/day; <em>effect</em> 1d3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> damage and 1d3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Int</a> damage; <em>cure</em> 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>

<p>Urhags are unnatural creatures that flop and scuttle through ancient ruins and barren canyon-lands. Originally native to the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/nightmare">nightmare</a> Plateau of Leng, they can slip into the waking world via an infected dreamerâs flesh.</p>
<p>Urhags crave the meat of sapient beings and enjoy infesting such hosts, even though urhags are barely capable of cohesive thought. Once an urhagâs victim dies, the urhag wears it like armor for a time while slowly consuming its flesh. Strangely, urhags avoid eating creatures incapable of dreaming, as they find their taste repellent. An urhag is about 4 feet long and weighs roughly 50 pounds.</p>

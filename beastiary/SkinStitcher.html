<h1>Skin Stitcher</h1>
<p class="description">This gaunt skeletal humanoid has heavily scarred flesh randomly stitched together. Its eyes are sunken and burn with hatred. </p>

<h4><span id="Augmented_Critical_Ex"><a name="TOC-Augmented-Critical-Ex-"></a>Augmented Critical (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If the skin stitcher scores a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> with a chain rake, it deals triple normal damage to an opponent.</p>
<h4><span id="Rage_Ex"><a name="TOC-Rage-Ex-"></a>Rage (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A skin stitcher that takes damage in combat has a 50% chance of flying into a berserk rage the following round, attacking its foe until either it or its opponent is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a>. It gains +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> and -4 AC while raging. The skin stitcher cannot end its rage voluntarily. Note that the skin stitcher does not drop its chains while raging.</p>
<h4><span id="Skin_Scent_Ex"><a name="TOC-Skin-Scent-Ex-"></a>Skin Scent (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The skin stitcher can detect any living creature that possesses natural skin to a distance of one-half mile. This includes all creature types, in most cases, except <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plants</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Elemental">elementals</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin">vermin</a>, and many <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> (undead with flesh, such as zombies, can be detected by a skin stitcher, but skeletons cannot). </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land and underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or gang (2-4)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>A skin stitcher is a malevolent and violent creature that kills for food, pleasure, and the skin of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> (which it keeps and collects). While it is known to eat just about anything it kills, it only keeps the skin and flesh of humanoid creatures. Other creatures are devoured, flesh and all.</p>
<p>Skin stitchers collect the flesh and skin of any humanoid creature slain. From this, they weave intricate clothes and coverings that they wear over their entire body. At a distance, the skin stitcher can pass for a normal humanoid when wearing one of these “skin suits” (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check DC 20 to reveal its true identity). Up close, the skin stitcher’s disguise becomes much less effective, making it appear as a humanoid with a heavily scarred and stitched together body.</p>
<p>The skin stitcher stands about 6 feet tall and (in its true form) appears as a skinless humanoid. Its natural body appears to be bone wrapped tightly with corded muscle and covered with a dark red-purplish slime. Its eye sockets are deep and contain large bulbous eyes with blue irises. The skin stitcher’s long, lanky arms end in claws as do its thick, muscled legs. It carries two large chains covered with many sharpened barbs.</p>
<p>Though their hands are clawed, skin stitchers prefer to attack using large chains covered with razor-sharp barbs. These not only aid in killing a foe, but also help strip the flesh from a victim. Skin stitchers often attack from ambush, attempting to gain the upper hand over their prey as quickly as possible. Slain opponents are skinned and then eaten or carried to the skin stitcher’s lair and devoured later.</p>

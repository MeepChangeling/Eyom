<h1>Redcap</h1>

<h4><span id="Boot_Stomp_Ex"><a name="TOC-Boot-Stomp-Ex-"></a><b>Boot Stomp (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p> A redcap wears heavy iron boots with spiked soles that it uses to deadly effect in combat. These boots give the redcap a kick attack that it can make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full-attack action or as part of its movement just as if it had the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/spring-attack-combat">Spring Attack</a> feat.</p>
<h4><span id="Heavy_Weapons_Ex"><a name="TOC-Heavy-Weapons-Ex-"></a><b>Heavy Weapons (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p> A redcap can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty.</p>
<h4><span id="Irreligious_Ex"><a name="TOC-Irreligious-Ex-"></a><b>Irreligious (Ex)</b></span></h4>
<p>Bitter and blasphemous, redcaps cannot stand the symbols of good-aligned religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Holy">holy</a> symbol, any redcap that can see the creature must make a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a> for 1 minute and attempt to flee. A redcap who successfully saves is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1 minute.</p>
<h4><span id="Red_Cap_Su"><a name="TOC-Red-Cap-Su-"></a><b>Red Cap (Su)</b> </span></h4>
<p> A redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a redcap gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls (included in the above totals) and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a> 3. These benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. Caps are not transferable, even between redcaps. A redcap can create a new cap to replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of work, although until the redcap takes a standard action to dip the cap in the blood of a foe the redcap helped to kill, the cap does not grant its bonuses.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests, mountains, or underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or gang (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> NPC gear (leather <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, Medium scythe, other treasure)</p>
<p>Redcaps embody both capriciousness and sadism. These stumpy, misanthropic fey freaks exist seemingly to indulge in blissful bloodletting and self-indulgent slaughter. Like prune-faced, angry old men, they mollycoddle their own inefficiencies and miseries in gore. Redcaps are most widely recognized for their long woolen caps, which they drench in the blood of their victims. Rumors and fairy stories abound concerning rituals and the cultural significance of their blood-soaked caps, though the practice likely evolved as an easy way for the brutish runts to create both <i>fear </i>and spectacle. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with twisted frames, pointed ears, and long white beards. They dress in soiled leather armor and wear oversized, iron-shod boots that make a distinctive clanging when they run.</p>

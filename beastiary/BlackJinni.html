<h1>Black Jinni</h1>
<p class="description">This appears to be a powerful humanoid figure, but it is difficult to make out due to the cloud of obscuring dust that perpetually hangs around it. The faint howl of winds and the smell of the deep desert seems to linger in its presence. It has recognizable features such as arms and legs, but they seem somehow wrong and out of proportion.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> or genie slain by a black jinniâs searing touch rises 1d4 rounds later as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> spawn.

Spawn created by a black jinni are under its control.</p>
<h4><span id="Dust_Vortex_Su"><a name="TOC-Dust-Vortex-Su-"></a>Dust Vortex (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day, as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a black jinni can cause the obscuring cloud that surrounds it to become a vortex of electrically-charged dust. This vortex is 20 feet high and radiates to a range of 30 feet, with the black jinni at the vortexâs center. The winds within this area are considered a windstorm, making normal ranged attacks impossible and causing a â4 penalty to siege weapon attacks against creatures in the vortex. Creatures within the vortex are subjected to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/weather#TOC-Winds">wind effects</a> â those who are blown back are instead drawn toward the center to a square adjacent to the black jinni. A creature that ends its turn within the dust vortex takes 10d6 points of electricity damage (DC 24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save halves). Once the dust vortex is created, it remains stationary, allowing the black jinni to move around in it or even leave it. The vortex remains in place for 1d6 rounds, or until the black jinni dismisses it as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Obscuring_Cloud_Ex"><a name="TOC-Obscuring-Cloud-Ex-"></a>Obscuring Cloud (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A black jinni is continually surrounded by a cloud of obscuring dust and scouring wind. This cloud gives it a +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> check while within a sandstorm or other area of blowing dust. In addition, a black jinni has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> while the cloud is in effect. Any strong (or stronger) wind can suppress the obscuring cloud as long as the wind persists.</p>
<h4><span id="Shocking_Touch_Su"><a name="TOC-Shocking-Touch-Su-"></a>Shocking Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature hit by a black jinniâs claw attack takes an additional 1d10 points of electricity damageâon a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>, this additional electricity damage increases to 2d10 points of damage and the creature must make a DC 24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or the electricity lingers on his body, inflicting an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage each round on the start of the victimâs turn for 1d6 additional rounds. Immersion in any liquid ends this ongoing damage, as does contact with a metal object of at least Medium or larger size that is in contact with the ground. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Stormwalk_Ex"><a name="TOC-Stormwalk-Ex-"></a>Stormwalk (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A black jinni is able to move about in any storm of natural or unnatural origin of hurricane velocity (75â174 mph wind speed) or less without suffering any of its effects.</p>
<h4><span id="Vulnerability_to_Recitation_Ex"><a name="TOC-Vulnerability-to-Recitation-Ex-"></a>Vulnerability to Recitation (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As cursed genies of evil and chaos, black jinn are strangely susceptible to certain recitations of holy tracts belonging to good or lawful deities or philosophies. These include the spells <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dictum">dictum</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/holy-word">holy word</a>, but also forceful recitations of nonmagical holy sermonizing. If a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin">paladin</a> of a lawful or good deity makes a successful opposed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (religion) check against a black jinni as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, the black jinni must make a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be instantly destroyed, leaving behind only a small spot of charred ash. If this save is successful, the black jinni instead takes 5d6 points of damage.</p>

<p> Thought by many, even among the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/genie/janni"> jann</a>, to be myths and dark legends, the black jinn are an accursed and forgotten tribe of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/genie">genies</a>. Bearers of ill will and bringers of destruction upon both mortals and their own kind, these hateful creatures are possessed by madness and a drive to call down ruin upon any who intrude upon their desolate sanctums. The few black jinn encountered on the Material Plane are thought of as terrors of the deep desert, arriving in sudden sandstorms, brilliant with electrical fury, and disappearing just as quickly to leave behind no trace of lost comrades, or merely leaving corpses, charred or glazed in molten glass. Largely, black jinn are creatures of myth and legend, but a handful of mortals know the terrible truth – which few live long enough to tell. Although typically surrounded by a cloud of dust, black jinn appear more fiendish than other genies. A cursed creature, they do not constitute a true race of jann, but rather a bloodline so corrupt as to no longer be considered part of this proud race. A black jinni stands 12 feet tall and can weigh as much 1,200 pounds, its body being mostly comprised of soot, dust, and foul smoke. </p>
<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p> The cursed remnant of some ancient bloodline of genies, black jinn are pariahs among even the other jinn races and have retreated over the years into the deepest, most desolate strongholds of the arid wastes of the Material Plane and the elemental planes. Also known by other names, such as black ghosts or nisnases, black jinn have no part in a natural ecology and tend to destroy any living things that exist in their vicinity. It is postulated that certain genies can become black jinn through utilizing taboo magic, trespassing upon sacred locations, or similarly provoking such misfortune, but such cases are largely undocumented and seem to be exceedingly rare. </p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p> Legends of black jinn are often associated with fabled lost cities hidden for centuries under a sea of desert sands. These legends always speak of the great treasures harbored by such forgotten cities, as well as the certain death that their discovery entails. The legends are largely true, as black jinn seem to favor such locales, enduring ages-long hermitages or self-inflicted exiles in avoidance of other living beings, though they still enjoy the trappings of civilizationâespecially those in ruin. On occasion, though, a black jinni finds itself overcome by wanderlust for a time and seeks to investigate civilized lands. On these occasions, black jinn sometimes choose mortal targets to shadow and terrorize before finally closing in for the kill â often after engaging in a nocturnal battle of wits wherein the hapless mortal might have a slight chance of saving himself. Alternatively, a black jinni might settle near a community and slowly curse the inhabitants with its lingering presence until all the residents are dead or the jinni is driven off by some hired holy man.</p>

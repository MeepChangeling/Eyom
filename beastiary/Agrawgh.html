<p>An agrawgh can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> through solid stone at half its normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> rate. When traveling using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> speed, as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> an agrawgh can choose whether to leave a tunnel in its wake that is 10 feet tall by 10 feet wide. As long as the agrawgh does not encounter any non-dirt or non-stone substances along its way, it digests dirt and stone with its stomach acids at a rate equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> movement speed. An agrawgh canât run or perform <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuvers</a> while <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing. If an agrawgh encounters any creature while <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing (such as one using meld with stone), it canât enter that square.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any underground (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Earth">Plane of Earth</a>)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or crew (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Burrowing creatures whose bodies sport a number of bronze rings that allow them to carve perfectly uniform tunnels, these natives of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Earth">Plane of Earth</a> use their impressive distended mouths to chew through dirt and stone, digesting the inorganic material with their powerful stomach acid. Agrawghs are typically 15 to 20 feet in length and weigh almost 2,500 pounds each.</p>
<p>According to legend, a benevolent but now-trapped elemental lordâcreated the first agrawghs to dig tunnels that would attract <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Extraplanar">extraplanar</a> races to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Earth">Plane of Earth</a>. Many of the planeâs existing caverns are the result of agrawghsâ wanderings, and some even speculate that the immense tunnel known as the Vent are the result of numerous agrawghs working in concert.</p>
<p>Agrawghs can speak Terran, as well as many common tongues. Unlike xorns, agrawghs care little for material wealth, but they are known for offering their services as diggers in exchange for the ability to travel to previously unvisited locales. Throughout history, a few spellcasters have called agrawghs to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> to assist in massive excavations.</p>
<p>An agrawgh can be summoned as an alternative option for the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster">summon monster V</a> spell.</p>

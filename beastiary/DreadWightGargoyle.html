<p><b>Tactics</b> <span>A dread wight gargoyle usually rushes into melee to strike a foe with as many of its energy-draining attacks as possible, trusting its thick hide to protect it from reprisal. A dread wight gargoyleâs natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</span></p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Create-Spawn-Su-"></a>Create Spawn (Su)</h4>
<p>Any creature killed by a dread wight gargoyleâs energy drain ability rises as a dread wight in 1d4 rounds. A dread wight created in this manner is under the command of its creator and remains so until either it or the creator is destroyed.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Command-Wights-Su-"></a>Command Wights (Su)</h4>
<p>A dread wight gargoyle can automatically command all normal wights within 30 feet as a free action. Normal wights never attack a dread wight unless compelled.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Energy-Drain-Ex-"></a>Energy Drain (Ex)</h4>
<p>A creature struck by a dread wight gargoyleâs natural attack gains one negative level. The save is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha">Charisma</a> based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Freeze-Ex-"></a> <p><b><span>Freeze (Ex)<br/> </span></b></p> </h4>
<p><span>A dread wight gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. A dread wight gargoyle that uses freeze can take 20 on its </span><span>Stealth</span><span> check to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.</span></p>
<p> <span>Dread wight gargoyles lie in wait for prey in large cemeteries or pretend to be statues decorating tombs and temples that attract pilgrimsâdespite the danger of encountering clerics in such places. They are more than happy to vent their rage on any living creature, priest or not, that comes within range.</span> </p>

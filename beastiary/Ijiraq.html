<h4><a name="TOC-Disorienting-Gaze-Su-"></a>Disorienting Gaze (Su)</h4>
<p>An ijiraq can level an icy stare at a creature within 30 feet. That creature takes a â20 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> checks for 24 hours (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> DC 23 negates). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. An ijiraq can use this ability while in the shape of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/herd-animals/elk">elk</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Hide-in-Plain-Sight-Su-"></a>Hide in Plain Sight (Su)</h4>
<p>An ijiraq can use the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> skill even while being observed. As long as it’s standing in terrain covered in ice or snow, an ijiraq can hide itself from view in the open without actually hiding behind anything. An ijiraq can’t use this ability while flying, and the ability has no effect when the ijiraq isn’t in icy terrain.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold forests or plains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (mostly valuable scrimshaw carvings)</p>
<p>Wardens of the north, ijiraqs protect the frigid beauty and placidity of their arctic homes against all who would trespass, regardless of race or intentions. They are creatures of icy resolution, merciless and unflinching as the arctic winds, bringing doom to both vicious and innocent interlopers equally. Aloof and mysterious, they prefer not to be seen in their natural form, instead cloaking themselves in the fur and shape of swift <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/herd-animals/elk">elk</a> or caribou. Yet even then they’re usually only glimpsed as fleeting shadows. Those who lock gazes with ijiraqs see the world around them begin to swim, seeming unreal to the extent that even a skilled forester might be unable to determine which way is north, and a life-long native of a place might become lost within sight of home.</p>
<p>Few can honestly claim to have ever seen an ijiraq’s true face, as the creatures wear skulls taken from impressive specimens of their alternate forms as masks. Ijiraqs typically stand about 5 feet tallâthough that height reaches over 6 feet including their impressive hornsâand weigh approximately 175 pounds.</p>

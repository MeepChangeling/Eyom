<h4><span id="Argent_Prince_Su">Argent Prince (Su)</span></h4>
<p>In his true form, Mammon lacks a body. The archdevil relies entirely on his possession <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> to interact with the physical world. In his true form, Mammon gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> quality, gains a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus">deflection bonus</a> to his AC equal to his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier (+11), and replaces his base speed of 50 feet with a fly speed of 80 feet (perfect maneuverability); he loses all abilities that rely on a physical body (including his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> score, the additional immunities gained from possessing the Argent Prince (see below), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/air-walk">air walk</a>, his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a>, and his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a>).</p>
<p>Mammon rarely interacts with others without possessing a body, and his favorite body to possess is that of the Argent Princeâa powerful unique <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> that represents the archdevilâs ideal form. The Argent Prince always fails its saving throw against Mammonâs <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/o/object-possession">greater object possession</a><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>, and Mammon can call the Argent Prince to his side across any distance (even across <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/planar">planar</a> boundaries) as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>âwhen he does so, he can possess the Argent Prince immediately. While possessing the Argent Prince, Mammon gains <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/air-walk">air walk</a> as a constant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>; the gleaming glory ability (see below); and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bleed">bleed</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Necromancy">necromancy</a> effects, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis">paralysis</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep">sleep</a> effects, and stunning.</p>
<p>When Mammon is not possessing the Argent Prince (typically because he is possessing another object or being), the Argent Prince loses all of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> abilities, but remains under the control of Mammon and can continue to fight or take other actions as Mammon directs. If the Argent Prince is destroyed, Mammon can rebuild it, but doing so requires the archdevil to remain sequestered in his workshop deep in Erebus for a year.</p>
<h4><span id="Gleaming_Glory_Ex">Gleaming Glory (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The Argent Princeâs gleaming metallic body reflects light and magic. In bright light, a creature within 60 feet is automatically <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a>, while one that moves or begins its turn within 10 feet is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 37 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or averts or closes its eyes as for a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> attack. Rays and magical ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attacks</a> have a 20% miss chance against the Argent Prince, and such missed attacks have a 20% chance of being redirected toward a random target within 60 feet; otherwise, they are deflected harmlessly. While possessed by Mammon, the Argent Prince increases both chances to 50%, and if the creator of an effect deflected by this ability is within 60 feet, Mammon can reflect it at that creature instead of choosing randomly. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">Gaze</a> attacks and light-based effects (including <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/color-spray">color spray</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-spray">prismatic spray</a>) targeting Mammon have the same chance as rays of being reflected, while area effects of this nature simply do not affect him. Mammon also has the same chance to move without harm through a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-wall">prismatic wall</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prismatic-sphere">prismatic sphere</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Mammons_Mark_Su">Mammonâs Mark (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any coin, gemstone, piece of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Jewelry">jewelry</a>, or art object that Mammon touches <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/bear">bears</a> his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> image for 13 days. He can sense the location of marked items (as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/locate-object">locate object</a>, even if such an object is in an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> space), and can communicate through them as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/enter-image">enter image</a>. In both cases, this effect has 10 times the normal range (or unlimited range within Mammonâs domain on Erebus). If a creature has a marked object in its possession for 24 hours, Mammon can locate that creature (as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/locate-creature">locate creature</a> with the same increase to range as above) at will as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, even if the marked object is discarded. Mammon gains a +10 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> checks and to the save DC of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/scrying">scrying</a> effects he uses against such creatures. If the creature is protected by an effect that protects against <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/scrying">scrying</a> and Mammon is in Erebus, the archdevil can expend one use of his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power">mythic power</a> to ignore that effect. This is a curse effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Plunderer_Su">Plunderer (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Mammon can sense wealth within 300 feet as if using a rod of metal and mineral detection. He also gains a +10 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/appraise">Appraise</a> checks and on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> checks to identify the magical properties of items, can attempt either check once per round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> to determine the value or properties of any item within his line of sight, and gains a +10 bonus until the end of his turn on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> checks to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a> a creature of or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Steal">steal</a> an item he has thus appraised or identified.</p>

<p>Mammon is the master of avarice, a fallen <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel">angel</a> long in service to Asmodeus; though slain by his enemies long ago, his spirit lingered in his hellish sepulcher, unwilling to surrender to oblivion. His hunger for life infused his spirit into the obscene wealth heaped about him in death, until he became one with the wealth of ages. The Grasping One is now vault keeper for all of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>, growing ever more resplendent as he discovers new treasures to incorporate into his form and reporting directly to Asmodeus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hellâs</a> accounts.</p>
<p>Mammon can possess objects and creatures with ease, but most often possesses the Argent Prince, a peerlessly sculpted 8-foot-tall metallic likeness of his former angelic glory, tastefully tainted with accents of his diabolic nature.</p>
<h3 class="header"><span id="Mammons_Cult">Mammonâs Cult</span></h3>
<p>Mammon is the patron saint of greed, and is worshiped by unscrupulous merchants and rapacious robber barons.</p>
<p>His sacred places are often in mansions, museums, and palaces of obscene opulence. Some give offerings to him in secret, while others shamelessly praise his name and the power of greed to all who are willing to listenâand even some who are not.</p>

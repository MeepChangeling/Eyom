<h1>Devil, Cabal (Uniila)</h1>
<p class="description">The curves of a shapely maiden define the outline of a mysterious figure wrapped in mist and strips of ancient robes. From beneath the rune-embroidered tatters stretch four, corpse-pale arms, each bearing either a blade or some mysterious arcane device. Hidden within the cowl of its hood shimmer the faintest outlines of a veiled face and a pair of eyes flickering with barely restrained energy.</p>

<h4><span id="Dread_Magic_Su">Dread Magic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>All spells an uniila casts draw upon terrible infernal eddies and the torment of damned souls. As such, all of an uniilaâs spells (not her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>) are strange and terrible to behold. This increases the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/spellcraft">Spellcraft</a> DC required to identify an uniilaâs spell as it is being cast by +5. In addition, at will, an uniila can choose to make a spell she casts particularly frightening. Any creature forced to make a saving throw to resist a spell cast by an uniila must make an additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save at the same DC or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1 round. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Infernal_Arcana_Su">Infernal Arcana (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once a target chooses to make use of this spell, it is cast at the uniilaâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> (typically 8th) and is treated as having the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil">evil</a> subtype. In addition, as the uniila chooses, she may spontaneously add the effects of any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats">metamagic feat</a> to the spell (without the spell being treated as though it were of an increased spell level). Typically, uniilas use this ability to compel magic users to rely on them for more powerful magic, though they might also use effects like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/widen-spell-metamagic">Widen Spell</a> to affect unintended targets.</p>
<h4><span id="Scroll_Mastery_Su">Scroll Mastery (Su)</span></h4>
<p>All uniilas possess <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/scribe-scroll-item-creation">Scribe Scroll</a> as a bonus feat. An uniila is treated as knowing all spells of 6th level or lower in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and can create <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls" style="font-style: italic">scrolls of</a> any of those spells. Whether an uniila knows rarer magic is decided by the GM.</p>
<h4><span id="Summon_Devil_Su">Summon Devil (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day, an uniila can attempt to summon 2d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/imp">imps</a> with a 55% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Witch_Token_Su">Witch Token (Su)</span></h4>
<p>By spending an hour in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a>, an uniila can create a token of arcane power. This token may take any form that takes up an item slot, and typically appears as a subtly fiendish ring, amulet, or similar piece of jewelry.</p>
<p>While it is worn by a mortal, all of the DCs of any spells the wearer casts increase by +1 (this effect stacks with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-focus">Spell Focus</a>).</p>
<p>However, while wearing a witch token, the bearer takes a â5 penalty on all saves made to resist spells and effects cast by the tokenâs creation. Also, while the token is being worn, the uniila can effectively scry through the token at will and without the wearerâs knowledge as long as he remains on the same plane.</p>
<p>Spells and effects that typically bar or confound scry also affect the witch token.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, an uniila can cause her witch token to erupt in a burst of destructive magic that deals 10d6 points of damage to the wearer. An uniila can only ever have one witch token in existence at a time and must destroy a previously created token before creating a new one. The damage of this effect is based on the uniilaâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or cabal (3â9)<br/><b>Treasure</b> double (4 +1 daggers, other treasure as magic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls" style="font-style: italic">scrolls</a> and writings)</p>
<h3><span id="Summoning_Cabal_Devils">Summoning Cabal Devils</span></h3>
<p>Uniilas eagerly seek passage to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> and as such welcome summons by mortal casters. Whether to experiment with spells, seek out new magic, or corrupt mortals with their knowledge, what plots an uniila holds often prove inscrutable and of secondary interest to a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner">summoner</a>. Tempering their desire to reach the mortal plane, an uniilaâs vanity prevents it from serving a witless or hopeless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner">summoner</a>. Thus, uniilas turn the act of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Summoning">summoning</a> about on those who call upon them via a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/planar-binding">planar binding</a> spell, requesting that such mortals demonstrate their spellcasting prowess. If the mortal effectively casts a spell the uniila does not know (not one of those spells she possesses as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerer</a> spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>), or performs a spell of 5th-level or higher, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the opposed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> check made to bind the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil">devil</a>. Occasionally, an uniila purposefully remains to serve an inferior spellcaster, or one that fails his opposed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> check. Granting the inept tools they should never possess amuses the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil">devils</a>, and even the most incompetent âmastersâ might prove useful in seeking out components of an uniilaâs ongoing projects in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>.</p>

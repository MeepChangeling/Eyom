<h1>Khargra</h1>
<p class="description">This creature resembles a man-sized cylinder covered in metallic scales. It sports three large âfinsâ spaced even around its circumference. Between each fin is a metal sheath from which slide long claw-like arms. A large hole in the front of its cylindrical body is lined with many small curved metallic teeth and seems to function as its mouth. </p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Earth-Glide-Ex-"></a>Earth Glide (Ex)</h4>
<p>A khargra can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth, including metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. Its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/move-earth">move earth</a> spell cast on an area containing a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing khargra flings the khargra back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Rend-Armor-Ex-"></a>Rend Armor (Ex)</h4>
<p>If a khargra hits with a bite attack, it deals normal bite damage and pulls apart any metal armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the opponent’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Bonus-Armor-">armor</a>. Creatures wearing no armor or non-metal armor are unaffected by this special attack (though they still take normal bite damage). Armor reduced to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> is destroyed and devoured by the khargra. Damaged armor gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken">broken condition</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Sundering-Bite-Ex-"></a>Sundering Bite (Ex)</h4>
<p>A khargra can making a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder">sunder</a> attempt with its bite attack against an opponent’s weapon or shield without provoking <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>. Resolve this using the normal rules for a sunder attempt. If the khargra succeeds on its CMB roll, it deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the weapon or shield. Note, against a khargra, a weapon or shield’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> is only one-half as effective as normal. This means that a light steel shield, for example, is considered to have a hardness of 5 rather than 10 against a khargra’s sunder attack. A weapon or shield reduced to 0 or less <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> is destroyed and half of it is swallowed by the khargra.</p>
<p>It only uses this special attack against metal weapons and shields. Damaged armor and weapons gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken">broken condition</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-"></a>Vulnerabilities (Ex)</h4>
<p>A khargra takes maximum damage from a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heat-metal">heat metal</a> spell (no save). A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transmute-metal-to-wood">transmute metal to wood</a> deals 1d6 points of damage per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> (maximum 20d6) to a khargra. It can attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving throw</a> (DC 17 + caster’s ability modifier) to reduce the damage by half.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> Elemental Plane of Earth<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or pack (2-5)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard coins (in digestive tract); no goods; no items</p>
<p>Khargras are native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and are usually only encountered on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> when summoned. On occasion, a khargra slips through a tear in the planar fabric and enters the Material Plane to digest ores and metals not normally found on its native plane. A khargra is a 5-foot long cylinder and weighs about 300 pounds. It is believed that khargras speak (or at least understand) Terran and Common, but no one is certain as communication with these creatures has always failed.</p>

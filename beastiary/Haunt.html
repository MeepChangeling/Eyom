<p>The haunt is the spirit of a person who died before completing some vital task. A haunt inhabits an area within 60 feet of where its body died and never leaves this area. (Noteâa haunt in possession of a material body can in fact leave its area and must do so in order to finish its task.) It desires but one thing its final rest. To accomplish this, it must possess a living creature and finish the task that prevents it from achieving everlasting slumber. A haunt only attacks <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid" target="_blank">humanoid</a> creatures.</p>
<p>A haunt attacks with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal" target="_blank">incorporeal</a> touch. It concentrates on a single foe, attempting to render it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless" target="_blank">helpless</a> by draining its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-" target="_blank">Dexterity</a>. Once that victim reaches <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-" target="_blank">Dexterity</a> 0, the haunt uses its malevolence ability to possess the body and then attempts to complete the task that binds it to this plane. If the haunt is attacked while possessing a body, it uses all the abilities of the host to defend itself.</p>

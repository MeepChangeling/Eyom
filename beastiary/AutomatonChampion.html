<h4><span id="Arcane_Pincers_Ex">Arcane Pincers (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A champion automatonâs pincers function as claw attacks but have been magically treated to make them more powerful. A champion applies twice its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> as a bonus on damage rolls with its pincers.</p>
<p>If a champion automaton grabs a creature smaller than itself with a pincer, the champion automaton does not gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition and can move normally while holding the creature in its pincer. While holding a creature in a pincer, the champion automaton loses access to that pincer attack and gains an additional slam attack.</p>
<p>If the champion automaton uses this slam attack against a creature or object while a creature is held in its pincer, the held creature takes damage equal to the slam attack on a hit. The champion automaton must still maintain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> every round, but it can do so as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> creature can attempt to break free as normal.</p>
<h4><span id="Energy_Beam_Ex">Energy Beam (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A champion automaton can focus the energy in its core to emit either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. The beam deals 8d6 points of damage to each creature caught in the area (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 20 half). Half of the damage dealt is fire damage and half is force damage. A champion automaton can use its energy beam once every 1d4 rounds. A champion automaton can use its energy beam when it is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> or being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Warriors_Resolve_Ex">Warriorâs Resolve (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The innate determination and instinct in a champion automatonâs core grants it an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus">insight bonus</a> to AC equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> bonus (if any).</p>
<p>Additionally, this resolve grants the champion a number of bonus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> bonus (if any).</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Axis)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Champion automatons are enormous <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> typically made from a combination of magically treated stone and metal, which allows them to withstand the powerful blows typically encountered in battle. Although these bodies are extremely heavy, the magical energies that power them allow the automatons to move as quickly as most other combatants, if not faster. A typical champion automaton is 14 feet tall and weighs 2 tons, though some reach as much as 40 feet in height.</p>
<p>The most notable features of a champion automaton are its enormous pincers. The durability of its body and the magical ritual that reinforces the pincersâ structure allows a champion automaton to swing its pincer with tremendous force. In combat, these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> use the pincers to clamp onto particularly pesky enemies. Once a champion has successfully grabbed an enemy, it remains free to keep swinging its pincer, slamming its captive foe into other enemies to damage both creatures.</p>
<p>The other devastating weapon of a champion automaton is the automaton core itself. The potent core constantly collects planar energy at an impressive rate in order to power the large <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>. A champion automaton can focus excess energy into a deadly beam of force capable of destroying structures or slaying large numbers of foes.</p>

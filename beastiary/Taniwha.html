<h4><span id="Fearful_Memory_Su">Fearful Memory (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a taniwha can manipulate the memories of any number of creatures within 100 feet. All targets of the attack must be within 30 feet of each other and each can attempt a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to resist the fearful memory. Creatures that fail become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a> for 2d6 rounds and flee the area; furthermore, their memories of encountering the taniwha are erased, as if via <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/modify-memory">modify memory</a> (CL 6th). When the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a> effect passes, the creature continues to harbor vague fears of the region where it first succumbed to the fearful memory, although it cannot remember exact details. Such a creature must succeed at a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to approach within 100 feet of this location. On a successful save, the creature can enter the area but is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for as long as it remains there.</p>
<p>On a failed save, the creature cannot willfully enter the area and canât attempt a new saving throw to enter the area for 1 hour. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect and a curse effect. The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Seize_Magic_Su">Seize Magic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a taniwha can attempt to seize a spellcasting creatureâs ability to use magic. The target must be within 100 feet of the taniwha.</p>
<p>If the target fails a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save, its ability to cast spells is hindered. Whenever the victim attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a> check (DC = 15 + the level of the spell being cast). On a failed check, the spellcaster fails to cast the spellâthe spell is not expended, but the action is wasted. This is a curse effect that lasts for 24 hours, but the taniwha can opt to end the effect at any time as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>

<p>Taniwhas are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> creatures that dwell within tropical lakes and rivers, preferably deep within remote jungles far from areas civilized by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>.</p>
<p>Taniwhas claim these locations as their own, working to maintain the areaâs natural purity and protect it from careless or evil interlopers who would defile the place. They especially hate poachers who hunt the jungles around their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> lairs and any who pollute the water.</p>
<p>Although taniwhas are ferocious looking, with their serpentine bodies and crocodilian heads, these river-dwelling creatures are actually quite friendly and often eager to befriend spellcasting creatures. Taniwhas adore magic and take great delight in âtastingâ magic from other creatures. A spellcaster who lets a taniwha use its seize magic ability to enjoy the flavor of a stolen spell in this manner often finds that, for the minor cost of enduring the curse for a day, she can secure a lifelong friend.</p>
<p>With their ability to seize magic and their own inborn <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> and deadly bite attacks, taniwhas are more than capable of <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/defending">defending</a> their lairs from most intruders, yet they prefer to rely upon fear rather than violence in securing their homes. It generally doesnât take many uses of their fearful memory ability for taniwhas to seed a local populace with the notion that the area around their lairs is a dangerous one to trespass upon. While fear is often regarded as a cruel or negative emotion, to taniwhas it is a preferred alternative to violence in the safekeeping of their homes.</p>
<p>A typical taniwha is 15 feet long and weighs 900 pounds, although rumors abound of much larger specimens.</p>

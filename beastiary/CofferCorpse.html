<h4><a name="TOC-Death-Grip-Ex-"></a>Death Grip (Ex)</h4>
<p>Because the coffer corpse grasps the victimâs throat, a creature in its death grip cannot speak or cast spells with verbal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Deceiving-Death-Ex-"></a>Deceiving Death (Ex)</h4>
<p>In any round in which a coffer corpse is struck for 6 or more points of damage (whether the damage bypasses the creatureâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> or not), the creature slumps to the ground, seemingly destroyed. If it has fastened its death grip on a victim, it releases its hold when it falls. A DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check sees through the ruse (necromancers gain a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Competence-Bonus">competence bonus</a> on this check). On its next turn, the coffer corpse rises again as if reanimated, triggering its fear ability.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Fear-Su-"></a>Fear (Su)</h4>
<p>A creature viewing a coffer corpse rise after it uses its deceiving death ability must make a DC 13 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked">panicked</a> for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<p>The coffer corpse is an undead creature formed as the result of an incomplete death ritual. It is often found haunting stranded funeral barges or in other situations where a corpse has not been delivered to its final resting place. The creature hates life and attacks living creatures on sight. A coffer corpse appears much as it did in life. At a distance, a coffer corpse is often mistaken for a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombie</a>.</p>
<p>In combat, a coffer corpse attacks with a slam attack. It attempts to grab an opponent around the throat, and if successful, the creature does not let go until either it is destroyed or the opponent is dead. Small percentages (25%) of coffer corpses carry weapons (usually either longswords or clubs) and use those in combat instead of their slam attack. Most however, rely on their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attack</a> as it allows them to use their death grip ability against an opponent.</p>
<p>A coffer corpseâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>. </p>

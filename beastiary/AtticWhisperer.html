<p> All of the voices that an attic whisperer steals linger around it in an invisible but audible aura of unnerving childlike whimpers, songs, and sobs. Any living creature that enters this area loses the benefit of all bardic performances affecting it and takes a â1 penalty on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throws. The attic whisperer can suppress or reactivate its aura as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. This aura is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. </p>
<h4><span id="Steal_Breath_Su"><a name="TOC-Steal-Breath-Su-"></a>Steal Breath (Su)</span></h4>
<p> A creature bit by an attic whisperer must make a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued">fatigued</a> for 1 hour. A fatigued creature that is bitten is instead <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted">exhausted</a> for 1 hour, and an exhausted creature falls asleep for 1 hour if bitten. The sleeper can only be roused by killing the attic whisperer or by using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic"><i>dispel magic</i></a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse"><i>remove curse</i></a>, or similar effects. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. </p>

<p> An attic whisperer spawns as the result of a lonely or neglected childâs death. Rather than animating the body of the dead youth, the creature rises from an amalgam of old toys, clothing, dust, and other objects associated with the departedâicons of the childâs neglect. The widely varying materials that fuse together to form these creatures lead to attic whisperers with vastly different appearances. Attic whisperers linger in the places where they were formed, typically old homes, orphanages, schools, debtorsâ prisons, workhouses, and similar places where children might be discarded. When an attic whisperer first forms, it does so without a skullâthis does not impact the creatureâs abilities in any way, but it usually seeks out a small animalâs skull as a form of decoration soon after it manifests. </p>
<p> An attic whisperers haunts shadowy, forgotten places like old buildings and dilapidated institutions, places that were once homes to both young children and subtle evils. Hiding in drafty attics and moldy basements, an attic whisperer might lie dormant for decades while the quick go about their livesâoften a scant f loor away. The coming of a new child, though, rekindles some hope in the creature, its animating spirits motivated by loneliness, and ever seeking comfort and companionship. Once an attic whisperer finds a potential playmate, it does all it can to ensure it will never be lonely again by attempting to lure its friend to it, singing nursery rhymes, leaving trails of old toys, or calling out in the stolen voices of other children. </p>
<p> Destroying an attic whisperer reduces it to its component parts, usually consisting of dusty junk left to molder in the attics of old houses, though a few items, such as china dolls, small lockets, music boxes, precious marbles, fine teacups, sculpted metal soldiers, or the like, may have some value. </p>

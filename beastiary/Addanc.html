<h4><a name="TOC-Death-Roll-Ex-"></a><b>Death Roll (Ex)</b></h4>
<p> When <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> a foe of its size or smaller, a addanc can perform a death roll upon making a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The addanc inflicts its bite damage and knocks the creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>. If successful, the addanc maintains its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>. </p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Hold-Breath-Ex-"></a>Hold Breath (Ex)</h4>
<p> An addanc may hold its breath for (four times its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> score) rounds before beginning to drown. </p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Swimming-Grapple-Ex-"></a>Swimming Grapple (Ex)</h4>
<p> An addanc can swim at full swim speed while <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> a creature. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate aquatic<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard </p>
<p> The addanc is a solitary predator that builds dams to create small lakes. Once its territory is defined, anything that comes near to the lake or adjoining river becomes the addancâs prey. The beast hunts by floating just under the surface of the water and waiting for its next meal to approach, at which point it attacks with a bone-crunching bite. With the prey held tight in its jaws, the addanc attempts to drag its quarry under the water. Both industrious and conniving, this monster possesses enough intelligence to wait for its prey to be the most vulnerable. Once it attacks, it goes immediately for the kill, giving its prey little chance to resistance. It cares not for its prey; it cares only for itself. </p>
<p> Like the natural beaverâs lodge, an addancâs lair can only be accessed from below the waterâs surface. The structure is a truly grisly location. As the creature uses the possessions and remains of its victims for decoration, and the stench of decay permeates the entire lair. The adjoining damn is composed of heavy tree branches and logs while long bones of larger prey are interspersed to shore the structure. A typical addanc lair is between thirty and fifty feet in diameter and rises about fifteen feet above the surface of the water. </p>
<p> An addanc is about seven feet long and weighs 250 pounds. </p>

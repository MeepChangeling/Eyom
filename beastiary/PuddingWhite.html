<h4>Acid (Ex)</h4>
<p>A white pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material quickly, but does not affect metal or stone. Any melee hit or constriction attack deals acid damage, and the opponent’s clothing and armor (non-metal only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saves. A wooden weapon that strikes a white pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless it succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. If a white pudding remains in contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 19 points of damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4>Camouflage (Ex)</h4>
<p>Since a white pudding looks like normal ice and snow when at rest, it takes a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) can use one of those skills instead of Perception to notice the white pudding. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice a subterranean-dwelling white pudding.</p>
<h4>Corrosion (Ex)</h4>
<p>An opponent that is being constricted by a white pudding suffers a -4 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.</p>
<h4>Suction (Ex)</h4>
<p>The white pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A white pudding can establish or release suction as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, and as long as it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a white pudding’s CMD score gets a +10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> to resist <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush">bull rush</a>, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold plains and underground<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A variety of the black pudding, the white pudding is found only in cold, frigid lands. It is white in color and uses this to its advantage by ambushing its prey.</p>
<p>White puddings attack by grabbing and constricting their prey. A white pudding waits motionless for its prey to move within range before striking.</p>

<p class="description">This enormous creature stalks forward on huge fibrous legs, a purplish glow emanating from its eyes and face that illuminates the underside of the large mushroom forming out of the top of its head.</p>

<p>Once every 1d4+1 rounds a mushroom golem releases a 10-foot cube of spores as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>
<p>These spores remain in the air until the beginning of its next turn (initial damage 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a>, secondary damage 2d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Cha</a>, DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> negates). Anyone who fails the roll at either stage is covered with small mushrooms.

<p>The damage a mushroom golem deals takes 4 times longer to heal naturally and resists <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> spells. A PC attempting to cast a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration">conjuration</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a>) spell on a creature damaged by a mushroom golem must succeed on a DC 26 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check or the spell has no effect. Any natural <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> looks and feels like mushroom fiber.

<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mushroom golem is immune to any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> that allows <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>.</p>
<p>Certain spells and effects function differently against it.</p>
<p>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transport-via-plants">transport via plants</a> spell drives a mushroom golem back up to 120 feet and deals 3d8 points of damage to it; A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/control-plants">control plants</a> spell slows a mushroom golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage to it A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/finger-of-death">finger of death</a> spell cast directly at a mushroom golem stops it from moving on its next turn and deals 5d8 points of damage to it. The golem gets no saving throw against any of these effects Any magical attack against a mushroom golem that deals electrical damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> would cause the golem to exceed its full normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it gains any excess as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>. For example, a mushroom golem hit by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/behir">behir</a> heals 7 points of damage if the attack would have dealt 22 points of damage. A mushroom golem gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal electrical damage.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests, underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or gang (2-4)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Mushroom golems have vaguely <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> bodies made from a single enormous green-spored <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Parasol">parasol</a> mushroom. They have no possessions, relying on their own abilities. A mushroom golem make any vocal noise, but can convey levels of danger to plants through a series of swaying gestures. It walks and moves with a flowing, steady gait, as if a breeze constantly blows about it. It does not utilize its full speed unless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares">threatened</a>.</p>
<p>Mushroom golems stand 15 ft. tall and are 12 ft. wide at the shoulders, with the rest of their bodies between 4 and 5 feet wide for most of the trunk, widening to 10 feet at the base. They have two 10 ft long arms and 2 7.5 ft legs. A mushroom golem weighs at least 2,000 pounds.</p>
<p>A mushroom <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> body is carved from a single green-spored <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Parasol">parasol</a> mushroom treated with rare <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> food along with nutrients of blood and bones from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> creatures, materials weighing at least 1,000 pounds (costing 2,000 gp). The mushroom must be of exceptional quality. Carving the body requires a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> (sculpting) check or a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession">Profession</a> (fungiculturalist) check.</p>

<p>Wand wasps are a fairly common breed of mystical pest in mageâs academies and spell scriptoriums. These intensely curious, inquisitive insect-like beings are natural thieves, who perceive an alluring aura around magical creatures and objects, especially wands. Fully charged wands radiate a sensation that the highly intelligent wand wasps describe as both a rush of golden light, a delicate chiming, and the aroma of the most delicious food imaginable. Wand wasps are fairly knowledgeable, self-taught occult experts, though their knowledge of magic is limited to the purely pragmatic, and often strays into esoteric matters of a particular spells âflavorâ and âripenessâ.</p>
<p>Wand wasps are often daring thieves who plague city-dwelling wizards and wandmakers, stealing a fully charged trinket here and there to nourish them for weeks. Others might be a somewhat unwelcome but accepted part of a magical universityâs daily life. Smarter institutions might âtameâ a wand wasp by offering it a regular diet of magical wands in exchange for service as a guard-beast. (These wand wasps are almost always provided non-lethal wands rather than deadly evocation-based wands.) Some wand wasps might even do double duty as tutors or identification experts, sometimes for public hire, if the language barrier can somehow be crossed.</p>
<p>Wand wasps are dog-sized elaborations of ordinary wasps.</p>
<p>These creatures lack stingers. Instead, their bulbous thorax terminates in a glowing orifice evolved to grasp and manipulate a wand as dexterously as a humanoid hand. Wand wasps tend to be cowardly, more interested in snatching a tasty wand and fleeing to fight another day than killing a pursuer. The great hazard of dealing with a wand wasp is they tend to favor evocation-based battle wands, and often carry one of these deadly magical weapons with them. These wands are a more than capable substitute for an ordinary waspâs poisonous stinger, and when threatened a wand wasp is dangerously indiscriminate with the weapon. Wand wasps donât care if they burn down an entire city district with wild fireballs or lightning bolts, as long as they kill whateverâs chasing them.</p>

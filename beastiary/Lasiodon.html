<h1>Lasiodon</h1>
<p class="description">The beast has a whale-like body complete with powerful tail and thick fins. Each of its six heads bears a nightmarish maw and a curved, fleshy growth that glows in the dark water with white light.</p>

<h4><span id="Black_See_Su">Black See (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A lasiodon sees perfectly in darkness, including magical <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a>. Each of its six heads protrudes a fleshy appendage that can project natural luminescence or shadow.</p>
<p>Once each round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, the lasiodon determines how many heads to light up to illuminate an area, increasing the illumination by one light level per head it chosen. If none of its heads project light, it can instead project magical <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a>. Each head then reduces the illumination level in the lasiodon’s space and reach, lowering the light level by as many as six steps to force magical <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a> if it desires.</p>
<h4><span id="Camouflage_Ex">Camouflage (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A lasiodon can spread itself out over a large area with its long necks and immense torso. It changes color to match the waters it swims in and moves with aquatic grace.</p>
<p>While submerged, a lasiodon takes no size penalty to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks.</p>
<h4><span id="Frozen_Food_Su">Frozen Food (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A lasiodon attacks live prey, freezing survivors to consume later. Once per round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> a lasiodon can breathe a 15-foot cone of freezing water from one of its heads. This cone can begin anywhere inside its space or reach. Creatures caught in the cone take 4d6 points of cold damage and are encased in ice for 1 minute.</p>
<p>An encased creature gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> condition until the ice melts or is destroyed. The ice has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> equal to the lasiodon’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier, as well as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> equal to 1/10th its normal hit point total. If the ice is created under water the subject floats upward 60 feet each round at the beginning of its turn. A successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save (DC 24) halves the damage and negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> condition and ice. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Gruesome_Grappler_Ex">Gruesome Grappler (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A lasiodon does not gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition when <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> Medium or smaller creatures and can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> more than one such creature simultaneously without penalty. A lasiodon can maintain a single <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> by substituting a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> for that head’s attack. It can maintain two grapples simultaneously as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, or as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> it can maintain all of its grapples.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold oceans<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Lasiodons are something out of ancient nightmares. They hunt the deepest oceans, luring inquisitive prey with the white glow of their protruding anglers and devouring it whole. With teeth able to slice solid stone, a lasiodon can freeze its quarry, sometimes attacking a school of large fish by freezing some and devouring others. In the darkest coldest depths, blocks of ice created by the creature’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> remain still for several seconds before ascending slowly.</p>
<p>Lasiodons are cunning but not intelligent or social. The ferocious predators require a large hunting area, so they are almost always alone when encountered. They mate every few years at particularly bountiful hunting grounds in a frenzy that turns green waters red.</p>
<p>Lasiodons never stop growing and seem immune to the effects of aging. Adult females average 60 feet long and weigh over 50 tons.</p>

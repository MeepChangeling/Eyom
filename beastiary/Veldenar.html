<h4><span id="Vacuum_Attack_Ex"><a name="TOC-Vacuum-Attack-Ex-"></a>Vacuum Attack (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a veldenar can suddenly open and expand its jaws, drawing anything within a 15-foot cone toward its mouth. Creatures caught in this area that are Large or smaller must succeed at a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> saving throw or be pulled into the veldenarâs space, potentially provoking <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>. Attacks of opportunity caused by this ability cannot be avoided with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> (though other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>, such as moving out of the veldenarâs square, can be avoided as normal). The saving throw is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Viscous_Air_Su"><a name="TOC-Viscous-Air-Su-"></a>Viscous Air (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, a veldenar can cause a 15-foot-radius sphere of air centered on its mouth to become incredibly dense. Gaseous creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw or be affected as if by a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> spell (CL 10th).</p>
<p>Other corporeal creatures treat the area as difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Unless consumed during the creatureâs vacuum attack (in which case the viscous air immediately dissipates), the viscous air remains for 10 rounds before dissipating.</p>
<p>Veldenars are unaffected by the viscous air. Creatures can notice the region of altered air from a distance of up to 20 feet with a successful DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Air">Plane of Air</a>)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Veldenars are ambush predators <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Native">native</a> to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Air">Plane of Air</a>. They have pale, almost clear, skin, four stubby leg-like appendages, a tail like that of a fish, and six black-and-red eyes on their heads. Veldenars are naturally buoyant in air. They typically feed on gaseous creaturesâespecially <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental/belker">belkers</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental/mihstu">mihstus</a>âthough veldenars attack most anything that gets too close.</p>
<p>Veldenars hide invisibly in areas that are abundant with prey. When a meal gets close enough, the veldenar unleashes its cloud of viscous air, then opens its mouth.</p>
<p>The sudden change in pressure draws the prey into its gullet to be digested. While veldenars are more than capable of eating <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> creaturesâand often do when such beings enter their hunting groundsâthey favor gigantic insects and beings of elemental fire.</p>
<p>A typical veldenar is around 17 feet long and weighs about 3,000 pounds.</p>

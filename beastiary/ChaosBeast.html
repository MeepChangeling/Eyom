<h4><span id="Corporeal_Instability_Su"><a name="TOC-Corporeal-Instability-Su-"></a>Corporeal Instability (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Clawâcontact (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Curse-Su-">curse</a>); <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 17; <i>effect</i> amorphous body and 1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> drain per round (see below); <i>cure</i> 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a>-based.</p>
<p>A creature cursed with an amorphous body becomes a spongy, shapeless mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape constantly melts, flows, writhes, and boils. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, helmets, and rings become useless. Large items worn or carriedâarmor, backpacks, even shirtsâhamper more than help, reducing the victimâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a> score by 4. Speed is reduced to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. The victim gains the amorphous quality, but cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (â4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a>).</p>
<p>A victim can temporarily regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creatureâs normal form for 1 minute. Spells that change the victimâs shape (such as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alter-self"><i>alter self</i></a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape"><i>beast shape</i></a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body"><i>elemental body</i></a>, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph"><i>polymorph</i></a>) do not remove the curse, but hold the creature in a stable form (which might not be its own form, depending on the spell) and prevent additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> drain for the duration of the spell; <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shapechange"><i>shapechange</i></a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stoneskin"><i>stoneskin</i></a> have a similar effect. The victim takes 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> drain from mental shock every round that it ends its turn in an amorphous shapeâupon being drained to 1 Wisdom, further Wisdom drain ceases and the amorphous body effect is permanent until removed via magic (no further number of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws">saving throws</a> can cure the condition at this time).</p>
<h4><span id="Resistant_to_Transformation_Ex"><a name="TOC-Resistant-to-Transformation-Ex-"></a>Resistant to Transformation (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Transmutation effects, such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Transmutation">polymorphing</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrification</a>, force a chaos beast into a new shape, but at the start of its next turn, it immediately returns to its normal form as a free action.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/>
<b>Organization</b> solitary or invasion (2â5)<br/>
<b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A chaos beastâs form changes without any goal or purpose. Though at any particular second a chaos beast may appear to have dozens of limbs, whether claws, tentacles, stingers, and so on, the lightning-quick shifts of its body mean most of these are gone before it has a chance to use them, and its attacks are always treated as claws regardless of the creatureâs appearance.</p>

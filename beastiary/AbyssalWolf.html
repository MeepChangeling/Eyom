<p>Abyssal wolves roam the Abyss seeking sources of meat. They savor the flesh and blood of lesser demons and have a particular liking for the taste of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/tiefling">tieflings</a> and good-aligned outsiders. Should a pack of abyssal wolves run across one of the aforementioned creatures, it does not hesitate to attack. The blood and flesh of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/half-fiend">half-fiends</a> is another meal that these monsters enjoy, so they rarely turn down an opportunity to hunt on the Material Plane. Many demon lords find it blasphemous that their own kind mate with mortals, and thus unleash these monsters on the Material Plane to deal with such creatures. Most often when encountered on the Material Plane, abyssal wolves have either been summoned by an evil spellcaster or unleashed by one of the demonic lords of the Abyss.</p>
<p>The abyssal wolf is a man-sized wolf that stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder. When enraged, the hair on the nape of its neck stands up and the wolf issues forth a low growl, bearing its razor-sharp (and usually blood-stained) teeth.</p>

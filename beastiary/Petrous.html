<h1>Petrous</h1>
<p class="title">Petrous <span class="level">CR 12</span></p>
<p class="description">Your hands quiver as you notice the cave wall that you have been relaxing on is stirring. A hefty and hulking monstrosity with gigantic claws has taken the place of your former backrest. The beastâs gaping maw seizes hold of your arm, piercing your armor. You strain to resist and pull free! It is then that you realize your body has become paralyzed from head to toe. Bon appetitâitâs dinner time!</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Petrous are incredibly patient and use their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Freeze-Ex-">freeze</a> special quality to hide for days or weeks at a time.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Petrous use their bites to paralyze troublesome opponents (such as spellcasters) while they claw the life from enemies that pose a martial threat.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Petrous are intelligent but reticent to back down from a fight with prey, only fleeing when vastly outnumbered or when reduced to 12 hp or less.</p>

<h4>Rocky Grab (Ex)</h4>
<p>When a petrous successfully hits with both claws (or rolls a natural 20 on an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a>) it grabs its prey tightly with its claws. This initial attack deals damage normally and starts a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> that does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>. The petrous has the option to conduct the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a> to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a â20 penalty on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus">CMB</a> check to make and maintain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>, but does not gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition. It then begins to crush prey using <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a>. If the petrous does not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a>, each successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>In some of the most magically infused areas of the underworld the souls of the dead bond with the rock itself, creating a gruesome creature. Its voracious appetites never seem to cease, and whole caravans are said to have been lost to its cavernous hunger.</p>
<p>Petrous are 10 feet tall and nearly 7 feet across. Their incredibly dense bodies are quite heavy and some weigh in excess of 2,400 pounds.</p>

<h1>Scythe Tree</h1>
<p> <i>This many-branched and twisted tree has few leaves on it. In the center of its trunk is a long, deep scar. Its roots are twisted and dark, blackened as if by fire.</i> </p>

<p> The scythe tree uses <span><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/lunge-combat">Lunge</a></span> to increase its reach on the first round of combat. It focuses its attacks on only one or two opponents, slicing them with <span><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/power-attack-combat">Power Attack</a></span>. Unused to strong resistance, the scythe tree fights until it is reduced to 13 hit points or fewer, at which point it tries to flee into the forest. </p>

<p> A scythe tree makes its primary attacks with its branches, which deal slashing damage and threaten a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> on a 19-20. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> Temperate forests<br/> <b>Organization</b> Solitary or grove (4-7)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> Standard </p>
<p>Scythe trees are malevolent plant creatures found in heavily forested areas where they naturally blend in with normal trees. Scythe trees are carnivorous by nature and draw very little sustenance from sun, air, or water, preferring a diet of dryad or elf flesh. They use Stealth to catch wandering prey by surprise. The scythe tree is an intelligent plant but does little with its intellect other than devise new and cruel methods to torment its food once it has secured meals.</p>
<p>A scythe tree, on average, is 20 feet tall, but may reach or exceed heights of 30 feet. It weighs about 3,500 pounds and has a trunk diameter of 3 feet. Its bark is dark brown, shading darker as it nears the roots. What few leaves a scythe tree has are reddish-brown (and do not change color or fall out as the seasons change).</p>
<p>The branches of a scythe tree resemble wicked-curving scythes (this is where the tree gets its name). The scar that appears on the trunk is the treeâs mouth (it appears as a scar when closed). Scythe trees hate treants and dryads and attack both on sight (though a scythe tree usually only confronts a treant when it outnumbers it).</p>

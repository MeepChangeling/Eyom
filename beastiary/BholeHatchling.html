<h1>Bhole Hatchling</h1>
<p class="title">Bhole Hatchling <span class="level">CR 14</span></p>
<p class="description">A huge worm-like organism, typically bursting from the earth or rock. It is eyeless, with a tattered hide that sloughs away and is regrown constantly, as well as a huge mouth with a star-like opening full of grinding teeth.</p>

<p>Bhole Hatchlings are not always large enough to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Engulf-Ex-">engulf</a> an enemy, and so sometimes must bite or thrash to cause damage. They are not particularly intelligent and rely on their size, strength, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing ability to avoid trouble or attack their prey. Like adults, Bhole hatchlings can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> quickly. They are resistant to acid or other environmental toxins, as well as extremes of heat and even fire.</p>

<h4><span id="Aura_of_Lesser_Gloom_Su">Aura of Lesser Gloom (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A bhole hatchling exudes a sort of âabsenceâ that impairs the effects of sight in all creatures within 120 feet. Within this area, all forms of vision (including <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision">darkvision</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision">low-light vision</a>) are obscured in a faint shadowy gloom, regardless of more powerful light sources in the area. Creatures relying on vision suffer a â4 penalty on vision-based <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks in this area and treat the bhole hatchling as if it were under the effects of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blur">blur</a> spell. As it is not technically a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a> effect, this aura cannot be countered via light effects, but creatures that are immune to vision-based attacks, as well as those under the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-seeing">true seeing</a>, can see through a bhole hatchlingâs aura of lesser gloom.</p>
<h4><span id="Immune_to_Magical_Control_Ex">Immune to Magical Control (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A bhole hatchling is immune to nearly all forms of mind control, including <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-monster">charm monster</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a>, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dominate-monster">dominate monster</a> spells. It is similarly immune to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-jar">magic jar</a> and possession attempts. <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">Confusion</a> and other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effects that donât give another creature direct control over a bhole hatchling work normally. Rare effects that allow a spellcaster to manipulate the exact effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion">confusion</a> on a creature provide one of the few ways to control a bhole hatchling by magicâessentially nudging it in the desired direction. Other methods, particularly those tied to strange and powerful artifacts, may work normally (GMâs discretion).</p>
<h4><span id="Overwhelming_Strength_Ex">Overwhelming Strength (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A bhole hatchling always applies 1-1/2 times its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapon</a> attacks.</p>
<p>Bholes are huge worm creatures that <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> through the planetâs crust. They have thick, rugged hides that constantly wear and peel off due to their savage environment, though they <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate">regenerate</a> just as quickly.</p>
<p>Bholes boast large mouths filled with razor-sharp teeth, which they use to carve their way through even the toughest rock formations, and also are useful in devouring smaller prey. They range greatly in size: a typical hatchling is at least 50 feet long and weighs many tons. Regardless of age, only part of a bhole typically protrudes through the earthâs crust to attack its prey.</p>
<p>The huge adults are rarely seen, but they spawn larvae or hatchlings close to the surface, and so their young are more commonly found. The hatchlings are also more aggressive in some ways than adults: they scour their environment for protein sources to support their rapid growth, and thus may emerge to attack in a situation when an adult might remain idle.</p>
<p>Essentially the larva from which full-grown Bholes spring, Bhole hatchlings dwell in the Dreamlands unless summoned to the material plane.</p>
<h3><span id="Sensory_Blank">Sensory Blank</span></h3>
<p>Bhole hatchlings are not yet able to produce the full âabsenceâ that protects the adults from being detected.</p>
<p>However, they can somewhat mask themselves with a lesser gloom effect, which does make them slightly harder to target.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any underground (Dreamlands)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or brood (3â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>

<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su"><a name="TOC-Create-Spawn-Su-"></a>Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> slain by a wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. These spawn are less powerful than typical wraiths, and suffer a â2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive â2 hp per HD, and only <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-">drain</a> 1d2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that created them until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become free-willed wraiths. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.</p>
<h4><span id="Constitution_Drain_Su"><a name="TOC-Constitution-Drain-Su-"></a>Constitution Drain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Creatures hit by a wraith’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> must succeed on a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-">drain</a>. On each successful attack, the wraith gains 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Lifesense_Su"><a name="TOC-Lifesense-Su-"></a>Lifesense (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Blindsight-Ex-">blindsight</a> ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Sunlight_Powerlessness_Ex"><a name="TOC-Sunlight-Powerlessness-Ex-"></a>Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Unnatural_Aura_Su"><a name="TOC-Unnatural-Aura-Su-"></a>Unnatural Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a wraith, unless a master makes a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal">Handle Animal</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride">Ride</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-">wild empathy</a> check.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, gang (3â6), or pack (7â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none<br/> </p>
<p>Wraiths are undead creatures born of evil and darkness. They hate light and living things, as they have lost much of their connection to their former lives.</p>
<h3><span id="Other_Variants">Other Variants</span></h3>
<p><b>White Wraith (+1 CR)</b>: Created by fiends from the distilled and corrupted souls of holy crusading knights who succumbed to temptation and died as sinners and blasphemers, white wraiths are composed of blinding white light rather than darkness. These tortured souls deal 2d6 points of cold damage and 1d8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Dexterity drain</a> with their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> touch. Furthermore, white wraiths do not suffer from powerlessness in sunlight, as do their lesser cousins, and in fact exude an aura of light that causes all creatures within 20 feet to become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> as long as they remain within this area of bright illumination. Creatures slain by white wraiths rise as normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/wraith/wraith-spawn">wraith spawn</a> in 1d4 rounds.</p>

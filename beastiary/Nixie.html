<p>Nixies are guardians of ponds, rivers, lakes, and springs. They prefer dwelling in idyllic places, which they protect from the depredations of predators and careless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>. While this often involves confusing enemies and driving foes away, nixies are not afraid of spilling blood to protect their homesâthough they prefer not to resort to such means unless completely necessary. Nixies are 4 feet tall and rarely weigh more than 45 pounds.</p>
<p>Nixies avoid combat if possible, using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person">charm person</a> to lead <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> away from their lairs. They sometimes use this ability to enslave people to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. They cast <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/water-breathing">water breathing</a> on charmed creatures helping with tasks below the surface. Nixies are reclusive and prefer to keep their presence hidden. They make lairs underwater, forming small communities if their numbers are great enough. Legends speak of a secret nixie kingdom at the bottom of a great lake, but no one has yet confirmed its location.</p>
<p class="title">Nixies in Mythology</p>
<p>The nixie (also known as neck or nix) of English and German mythology is not nearly as benevolent as those presented here. In their traditional folktales they are often depicted as beautiful creatures that lure people into the water to drown. These more malevolent nixies could change shape, becoming any number of aquatic forms. To replicate these stories of more sinister nixies, add the following abilities to the standard nixie. A nixie with these abilities is CR 2.</p>

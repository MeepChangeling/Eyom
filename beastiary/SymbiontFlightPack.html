<h4><span id="Sonic_Buffet_Ex">Sonic Buffet (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> while flying, the flight symbiont can flap its wings to release a concussive blast in a 30-ft. cone. All creatures caught in the cone must attempt a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. On a failure, the creatures take 3d8 points of bludgeoning damage and are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deafened</a> for 1d4 rounds. A successful save halves the damage and negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deafened</a> condition. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Cold_Resistance_Ex">Cold Resistance (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The flight symbiont absorbs the first 10 points of cold damage per attack that the host would normally take as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resist-energy">resist energy</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Flight_Ex">Flight (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> the flight symbiont unfurls into a network of vines, framing thin, membranous leaves allowing the host to fly with a speed of 60 ft. (average maneuverability), gaining a +3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Competence-Bonus">competence bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly">Fly</a> checks made with this ability. The host can <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fly">fly</a> for up to a maximum of 5 consecutive minutes each time this ability is used, though these minutes do not need to be used at once and may be split up into 1-minute increments. If the symbiont and host are still airborne at the end of this time they both fall. Once a symbiont has flown for its maximum number of minutes or its host has dismissed the wings as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> the symbiont may not grant flight again for a number of minutes equal to the total time it was most recently in flight.</p>

<p>A flight pack symbiontâs thick roots pierce the hostâs upper back and shoulders, connected to a horizontal central stem. An extensive network of vines extend from the stem, forming a frame much like a batâs wing. The flight symbiontâs thin, almost translucent, leaves stretch between the vines. Its vascular system is designed to use the hostâs blood to pump through the wings to create a hydraulic system of movement.</p>
<p>When detached from a host a flight pack symbiont resembles an enormous butterfly or moth made from bark, roots, and large leaves. It moves with considerably less grace when not attached to a host and able to benefit from the symbiotic connection.</p>

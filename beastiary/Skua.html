<h4>Dive-Bomb (Ex)</h4>
<p>When a charging skua confirms a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>, the creature hit must succeed on a DC 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p>The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. The skua can only use this special attack while flying.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold coastline and swamps<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or flock (3â20)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Measuring nearly two feet long with a four-foot wingspan, this bird has a brown coloration with white streaks on its wings.</p>
<p>Many birds inhabit polar coastal regions. On our planet, penguins are practically synonymous with Antarctica. Most avian predators ignore or avoid <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>, but one group of polar seabirds rightfully earned its reputation for aggression and overall bad behavior â the skua. These little-known birds predominately dwell in coastal areas or swamps bordering polar seas and oceans, though they occasionally <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fly">fly</a> farther inland in search of food. These carnivorous birds commonly feast on carrion scavenged from the kills of other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>, but they also attack other birds and land <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a> twice or even three times their size. Creatures trespassing close to their nests feel the full brunt of the skuaâs belligerence. The parent bird swoops down from the skies and viciously pecks and slashes at the intruderâs head. Not surprisingly, the ornery skua shows little regard for the brooding grounds of other birds. They frequently <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Steal">steal</a> eggs and live chicks from their avian counterparts.</p>

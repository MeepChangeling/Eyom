<p>Fire drakes lair in caves and caverns deep within the hills and mountains. Fire drakes are carnivorous creatures and very territorial, fighting other drakes that move into their area. They are tolerant of other fire drakes, but view them with suspicion. On occasion, a mated pair is encountered, but only in the late summer months or early autumn.</p>
<p>Fire drakes are often mistaken for young or miniature red dragons. A typical fire drake is 4 feet long, though it can grow to a length of 6 feet. Fire drakes prefer to open combat with their breath weapon. Once expended, they rely on their bite. Their claws are too small to be effective in combat.</p>
<h3><span id="Fire_Drake_Blood">Fire Drake Blood</span></h3>
<p>The blood of a fire drake can be sealed in an airtight container and used as a firebomb, equivalent to a flask of alchemistâs fire. It can also be used to create temporary  <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming">flaming</a> weapons. A weapon coated with fire drakeâs blood acts as a  <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming">flaming</a> weapon for 1d4 rounds or until the first successful hit, whichever comes first. </p></div>

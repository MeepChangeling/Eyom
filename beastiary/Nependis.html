<h4><a name="TOC-Abduct-Ex-"></a>Abduct (Ex)</h4>
<p>When a nependis successfully grabs a Medium or smaller opponent, on that turn it can spend a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> to move up to its speed. This movement provokes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> as normal. A nependis that succeeds at a second <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check against the opponent can move up to its full speed as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> instead of up to half its speed.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Roar-Su-"></a>Roar (Su)</h4>
<p>A nependis can let out a savage roar. Nependises within 60 feet gain a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus">morale bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>, saving throws, and weapon damage rolls for 1d4 rounds. All other creatures other within range of the roar become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1d4 rounds (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 14 negates); this is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> sonic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or troop (3â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Fiercely territorial, the brutish nependises drive away any other large predators from their hunting grounds, even others of their kind. Only mated pairs caring for a litter tolerate each other, and even they separate once the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves. Nependises favors intelligent prey, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> in particular, both for the taste and the thrill of the hunt. They ambush opponents by jumping down from trees, grabbing the creatures, then retreating to find a safe place to eat. When challenged in its territory, a nependis drops from the trees, roars, then fights on foot. A nependis’s sharp hooves allow it to climb trees as well as a great <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cat">cat</a>, leaving telltale scars in the bark.</p>
<p>While nependises appear as hybrids of apes and boars, they aren’t related to either. Some ascribe the origins of these creatures to a clan of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ogre">ogres</a> cursed into monstrous forms, or guardians bred and raised by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> who later turned upon their former masters.</p>
<p>A full-grown nependis stands 9 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. A newborn nependis takes 4 years to reach maturity. Nependises rarely die from natural causes, and they live as long as 80 years.</p>

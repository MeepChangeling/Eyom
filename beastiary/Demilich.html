<p>This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> functions like <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bestow-curse">bestow curse</a>, but can have one of the following effects: -12 to one ability score; -6 to two ability scores; -8 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>, saves, and checks; or a 25% chance to act normally. This ability is treated as a 6th-level spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Su"><a name="TOC-Immunity-to-Magic-Su-"></a>Immunity to Magic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A demilich is immune to any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> that allows <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. In addition, certain spells function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-evil">dispel evil</a> spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw.</li>
<li><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/holy-smite">Holy smite</a> affects a demilich normally.</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/power-word-kill">power word kill</a> spoken by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the demilich if it fails a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save (with a DC determined as though the spell allowed a saving throw).</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/shatter">shatter</a> spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Rejuvenation_Su"><a name="TOC-Rejuvenation-Su-"></a>Rejuvenation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A destroyed demilich reforms in 2d6 days. To permanently destroy a demilich, holy water must be poured over its remains within the area of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hallow">hallow</a> spell. To complete the destruction, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/holy-word">holy word</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-evil">dispel evil</a> must be cast. If the caster succeeds at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check with a DC equal to 10 + the demilich’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>, the demilich is permanently destroyed.</p>
<h4><span id="Telekinetic_Storm_Su"><a name="TOC-Telekinetic-Storm-Su-"></a>Telekinetic Storm (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a special use of its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/telekinesis">telekinesis</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>, a demilich can churn up its treasure, dust, bones, and other loose debris in the area into a whirling storm about its skull. The storm obscures vision as a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fog-cloud">fog cloud</a> within a 20-foot spread centered on the demilich’s skull. Creatures within the storm take 12d6 points of damage per round on the demilich’s turn (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 20 for half damage). The demilich can maintain the storm indefinitely by concentrating.</p>
<h4><span id="Torpor_Ex"><a name="TOC-Torpor-Ex-"></a>Torpor (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A demilich takes no actions against intruders unless its remains or treasure are disturbed.</p>
<h4><span id="Unholy_Grace_Su"><a name="TOC-Unholy-Grace-Su-"></a>Unholy Grace (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A demilich gains a bonus on saves and a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> to AC equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier.</p>
<h4><span id="Vorpal_Susceptibility_Ex"><a name="TOC-Vorpal-Susceptibility-Ex-"></a>Vorpal Susceptibility (Ex)</span></h4>
<p><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Vorpal">Vorpal weapons</a> of any kind ignore a demilich’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>.</p>

<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> double </p>
<p>In their endless years of unlife, some <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">liches</a> lose themselves in introspection, and can no longer rouse themselves to face the endless march of days. Still others cast their consciousness far from their bodies, wandering planes and realities far beyond mortal ken. Absent the vitality of the soul, such a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> physical form succumbs to decay over the centuries. In time, only the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> skull remains intact. Yet the bonds of undeath keep the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> remains from final dissolution. Vestiges of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> intellect remain within the skull, and wake to terrible wrath should it be disturbed. Traces of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> will to live strengthen the skull, rendering it harder than any steel. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> greed and lust for power manifest in the growth of gems in its skull. Lastly, though only the barest remnants of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> eldritch might survive, a demilich aroused to anger still retains enough power to flense the very soul from any defiling its final rest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> phylactery invariably fails during the slow decline of lich into demilich, losing its last vestiges of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment">enchantment</a> if not crumbling into dust with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> body. But even without the preserving power of the phylactery, demiliches retain a tenacious grip on existence. Only powerful and precise use of magic can permanently destroy a demilich and its remains. To the unwary adventurer, a demilich looks like nothing more than dust and bones within the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> former sanctum. Indeed, until disturbed, a demilich has only the vaguest awareness of intruders, and ignores their presence. Any attempt to steal the demilich’s possessions, disturb its remains, or harm its domain rouses the demilich’s slumbering mind, causing it to rise up in the air and voice its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wail-of-the-banshee">wail of the banshee</a> before again settling to the ground. Should the interlopers relent, the skull returns to its torpor. But if they persist, the skull rises again, not to rest again until all in its sight have perished. Fortunately for intruders, demiliches never pursue those wise enough flee.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:20px"><span id="Becoming_a_Demilich"><a name="TOC-Becoming-a-Demilich"></a>Becoming a Demilich</span></h2>
<p>Most demiliches achieved their state through apathy, not volition. For each decade that a demilich fails to stir itself to meaningful action, there is a 1% cumulative chance that its corporeal body decays into dust, save for the skull. Any return to activity resets the chance of transformation to 0%. Once the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> body decays, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> intellect returns to its phylactery as normal. However, the skull rejects the return of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> consciousness, keeping the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich</a> trapped in its deteriorating phylactery for 1d10 years. If during that time the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> remains are destroyed or scattered (for example, by wandering adventurers), the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> phylactery forms a new body and the intellect leaves the phylactery as normal, returning the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich</a> to life. But if the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> remains survive unperturbed, the phylactery’s magic fails catastrophically, releasing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> soul and causing 5d10 points of damage to the phylactery. Regardless of whether or not the phylactery physically survives, the energies released by its failure channel into the lifeless skull of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich</a>, allowing the last remnants of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> soul to transform it into a demilich. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> soul itself either is utterly destroyed, reaches its final reward or punishment, or is condemned to wander the edges of the multiverse forever.</p>
<p>For wandering <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">liches</a>, the process is similar, but based on the number of decades the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich</a> spends without its intellect returning to its body. While the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> body still decays, its mind remains at large, only becoming trapped in the phylactery if the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich</a> tries to return during the period in which its body has failed, but it has not yet become a demilich. Should the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> phylactery fail before the wandering <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich</a> returns, the skull becomes a demilich, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">lich’s</a> mind is doomed to wander until the end of days.</p>

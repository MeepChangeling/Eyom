<h1>Grim Reaper</h1>
<p class="description">This tall, cloaked figure stares out from the black hood that covers its head. It wields an enormous scythe in its skeletal, bone-white hands, looking as though it is freezing the very air around it.</p>

<p>A grim reaper automatically confirms any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>. A creature damaged by a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> from a grim reaper must succeed at a DC 34 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw or be instantly killed. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Status-Sight-Su-"></a>Status Sight (Su)</h4>
<p>When a grim reaper gazes on a creature, it can see that creature’s emotion aura and that creature’s current health and overall well-being.

<p>Known by many names throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the personifications of death and all the pain and fear associated with that state. They are universally feared by the living as harbingers of destruction and masters of all that has already passed from life. These hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but themselves.</p>
<p>While grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone. The towering, ghost-like grim reapers are served by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/minor-reaper">minor reapers</a>, corporeal servitors that enact their masterâs dreadful will and meet out deathâs unrelenting touch. A grim reaper has no physical weight except for its equipment.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</h4>
<p>Grim reapers have no creator and are not born by any definition of the wordâthey simply exist, much as the multiverse itself does. Some philosophers argue that grim reapers were created along with the Negative Energy Plane, manifesting from this plane when mortalkind first realized deathâs terminal permanency. Others claim that multiple minor reapers meeting on the Negative Energy Plane or another area infused with overwhelming negative energy might join together to form a new grim reaper.</p>
<p>While similar in shape to the psychopomps, reapers care little for mortal souls, reveling in the moment of death and dissolution of the impermanent, regardless of the elaborate bureaucracy that oversees the doomed.</p>
<h3>Habitat &amp; Society</h3>
<p>If summoned by a grim reaper, minor reapers act as its additional eyes and ears, and if they are destroyed, their master is immediately aware of their obliteration. Other times, a grim reaper may summon minor reapers to aid in its escape from a battle it expects to lose, and flees to another plane of existence where it may recover and better prepare for the annihilation of its targets.</p>
<p>Grim reapers possess the ability to speak to any intelligent being, and the few who have survived encounters with a reaper or its minions claim that the bringer of death spoke to them in a deep, unearthly voice like nothing in the material realm.</p>
<p>Minor reapers can be created by casters of 20th level or higher using the spell <i>create greater undead</i>.</p>

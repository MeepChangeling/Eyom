<h1>Drake, Star</h1>
<p class="description">Twinkling motes of light move around this draconic creature’s body like a tiny galaxy. The stars twinkle across the creature’s metallic scales.</p>

<h4><span id="Nimbus_of_Stars_Su"><a name="TOC-Nimbus-of-Stars-Su-"></a>Nimbus of Stars (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A star drake has a continual supply of tiny motes surrounding its body. Any non-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blind</a> creatures within 10 ft. of the drake must make a DC 24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a>-based) or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a>. Those who succeed are still <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> by the nimbus. These effects last while the creature is within the aura and an additional round after the creature leaves.</p>
<h4><span id="Searing_Star_Su"><a name="TOC-Searing-Star-Su-"></a>Searing Star (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once every 10 rounds, a star drake can gather up energy from its nimbus, reducing its effective range to 5 ft., in order to create a powerful globe of energy. By succeeding at a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/drakes">drake</a> strikes an opponent with the globe, which explodes for 6d8 force damage and blinds the target (a DC 24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw prevents the blindness but not the damage). Against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> without the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Native">native</a> subtype, the damage increases to 18d8.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, binary (2), or cluster (3â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>A star drake has a typically draconic appearance, differing from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon">true dragons</a> primarily by its mottled metallic scales (usually silver and gold in varying patterns) and the nimbus of tiny stars surrounding the entirety of its body. Subtle signs give an observant viewer a clue as to the originating <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/drakes">drake</a> stock, such as horn or tail shape. A star drake generally measures 10 ft. in length and weighs roughly 500 lb.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, a drake’s curiosity about the world around it drives it to seek out experiences beyond the physical realms, and it finds companions with which it experiences the wonders of the multiverse. It returns from its travels with a changed appearance, demeanor, and powers. Regardless of which type of drake embarked on its planar journey, the creature always returns as a star drake.</p>
<p>Due to its experiences across the planes, a star drake takes on the mantle of protector of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. No matter the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> of a given <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsider</a>, a star drake sees it as a meddler in the affairs of humanoid races. In the drake’s mind, an angel presents as much of a threat as a devil. Depending on the outsider in question, the drake attempts to negotiate with it, drive it off, or destroy it. Occasionally, the drake leads an incursion of its own, with other star drakes or like-minded adventurers, to clearly make the point it does not welcome <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Extraplanar">extraplanar</a> predators.</p>
<p>Star drakes transform from existing drakes. Certainly, no creature has ever spoken about its transformation, but its former companions describe a process where the drake incorporates the essence of the plane it travels in. As a drake ages, its nimbus grows ever brighter and more powerful, to the point the creatures must depart their home worlds for the firmament. There, sages speculate, they add to the tapestry of the night sky and perhaps form the basis of a new system of planets.</p>

<p>Arachs are a strange union of sentient arachnids and humanoids. With the exception of their heads, they are completely hairless, and their skin ranges from glossy brown to grey and pitch black with white plates on the males and red plates on the females. Many believe they were once worshipers of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/spider">spider</a> god who long ago were granted this horrid transformation.</p>
<p>Arachs live in small colonies (called nests among their own kind) in caves and caverns deep underground. They generally shun other subterranean races preferring to keep company with their own kind. Occasionally an arach nest makes an alliance with a band of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/drider">driders</a> though such a union is usually short-lived (the races get along, but donât particularly like each other for unknown reasons). A nest is led by the most powerful spellcaster among the members, usually a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerer</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizard</a> of at least 7th level.</p>
<p>Arach nests include an equal number of male and female members. Both forage and hunt for the nest, and in times of battle, both fight to defend the lair. During mating season, females are less active as they await the birth of their young. Young are always born live and a typical female spawns 1d4 young at one time. Young arachs reach maturity after 6 years.</p>
<p>An arach stands about 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.</p>

<h1>Oni, Earth Yai</h1>
<p class="description">Jagged cracks and pebbled growths mar the surface of this three-eyed giantâs rocky skin, making it appear to have burst forth from rugged stone.</p>

<h4><span id="Spiky_Skin_Ex"><a name="TOC-Spiky-Skin-Ex-"></a>Spiky Skin (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An earth yai may grow spikes from its stony skin at will as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. These spikes are treated as armor spikes that deal 1d10 points of damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Stony_Missile_Su"><a name="TOC-Stony-Missile-Su-"></a>Stony Missile (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, an earth yai can fire an incredibly dense stone from its third eye. This attack has a range of 200 feet, with no range increment, and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Upon striking the target, the stone immediately makes an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/awesome-blow">Awesome Blow</a> attempt against the target using the earth yaiâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus">CMB</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate mountains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, band (1 plus 4â8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/stone-giant">stone giants</a>), or tribe (1 plus 2â3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/stone-giant">stone giant</a> elders and 10â20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/stone-giant">stone giants</a>)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard </p>
<p>Although they possess the rocky physiques and near indestructibility of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/stone-giant">stone giants</a>, earth yai scorn that raceâs humble ambitions, and instead prove as brutal and destructive as avalanches. For them, physical force and destruction are the ultimate demonstration of power.</p>
<p>This belief doesnât necessarily require them to be the strongest or to go on gory rampages, though. After all, what is mere strength if a soldier can fire a catapult that brings down an entire tower, or an emperor can give the decree beginning a war that ravages an entire empire, using both their tools and words to sow ruin. Such ability to cause calamity grants one power over others; those who have the potential to cause the greatest devastation have the greatest power. Earth yai endlessly seek to hold the greatest power, leading many to become brutal warlords or bandit kings, but some to embrace more subtle, longterm machinations in their pursuit of gradual and farreaching ruin.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural</a> form, an earth yai stands 16 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p>Earth yai possess forms similar to the rocky bodies of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/stone-giant">stone giants</a> their otherworldly shapes mimic. While <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/stone-giant">stone giants</a> often appear to be sculpted from rock, earth yai tend to have a more rugged appearance, with features that seem to have been clawed from mountainsides, teeth and claws like sharp stones, and three eyes like angry red gems. Their skin is always as hard as rock, the cracks and ravines that riddle their bodies having no impact on their formidable resilience.</p>
<p>Like their yai brethren, earth yai possess an unnerving third eye that serves as a portal through which destruction passes. Whenever one so chooses, it can cause a shard of stone to blast from its eye at the speed of a catapult shot.</p>
<p>Those struck risk being crushed by the rock, but might also be thrown aside by the sizable projectile. Earth yai typically use this incredible ability not only to annihilate those who oppose them and intimidate witnesses, but also to tear down larger structures or sow greater devastations, like by using it to start landslides, break dams, or destroy bridge supports.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Earth yai enjoy the moment when their long-term plans reach fruition, and might spend decades reveling in past successes before moving on to new conquests. An earth yai who manages to conquer a community or subjugate a region might spend this time acting as a brutal tyrant, installing itself in a palace or fortress and demanding that its slaves supply its every whim. Those who refuse are dramatically murdered. While one of these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> would never give up past conquests, most earth yai eventually grow bored and seek new challengesâif such opportunities donât present themselves during the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni’s</a> rule. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> might move on to find new opponents, but still regularly return to their past holdings to reinforce their control and instill dread among their prisoners.</p>
<p>While an earth yai does not have the greatest intelligence and cannot necessarily outwit a wise hero, most possess deep wells of patience and centuries of experience. An <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> who finds itself bested time and time again might wait out foes or opposing alliances. Their ages of experience mean that earth yai can generally discern the amount of time they must wait before a threat to them passesâperhaps with the help of a few inconvenient disasters to accelerate an enemyâs decline.</p>
<p>When two or more earth yai encounter one another, they invariably engage in an extended strategic match, seeking to undermine and outdo each other in acts of cleverness and violence. All earth yai know that a battle between two of their kind must end in a face-to-face confrontation and brutal combat. Occasions for assassination or impersonal defeats might arise in such conf licts, but they are never exploited. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> see a final battle between members of their kind as a form of honor, and all seek to avoid slighting even their weakest or most reviled kindred.</p>
<p>Although all earth yai dream of being the masters of regal citadels dominating lands filled with fearful servants, few actually achieve this goal. Those still campaigning for their despotic dreams typically find lairs in mazelike mountain ravines and in large caverns near the earthâs surface. These hideaways can prove notoriously difficult to uncover, as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> often make use of their <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/passwall">passwall</a> ability to sink through solid barriers or walk past gates that donât appear to be portals at all. There they meditate and plot, seeing all the threads of probable events in their minds and determining which ones they need to pull on to shape the future to their liking. If any creature interrupts an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> in its lair, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> violently attacks, viewing intruders as not just dangerous, but dishonorable, as they trespass upon the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni’s</a> private home. This obsession with privacy extends not just to yai in their secret lairs, but also to those with greater holdings. Most earth yai only tolerate creatures of living stone to share their homes, and only bear the intrusion of lesser creatures when they themselves demand the lesser creaturesâ presence.</p>

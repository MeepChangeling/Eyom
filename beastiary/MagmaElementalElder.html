<p class="description">This rocky monster glows with an internal heat. Red light spills from its eyes and mouth, as well as fractures in its outer surface.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Burn-Ex-"></a><b>Burn (Ex)</b></h4>
<p>A magma elementalâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burn-Ex-">burn</a> DC includes a â2 racial penalty, as their fires donât burn quite as hot as true elemental flames.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Earth-Glide-Ex-"></a>Earth Glide (Ex)</h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone had been polished. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/move-earth"><i>move earth</i></a> spell cast on an area containing a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Lava-Puddle-Su-"></a>Lava Puddle (Su)</h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a magma elemental can vomit forth a puddle of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Lava-Effects" rel="nofollow">lava</a> that fills its space to a depth of 2â3 inches and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round. The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after a number of rounds equal to the elementalâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. At the GMâs discretion, this puddle of lava could start secondary fires.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Plane of Fire)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or gang (3â8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p> In the border areas between the Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire, volcanoes and continent-sized lava flows are commonplace. Elementals in this area tend to have aspects of both planes, and the typical sort is the magma elemental, an earth elemental with a core of liquid fire. Magma elementals generally have a somewhat feral or bestial appearance.</p>

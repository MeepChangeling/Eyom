<h4><span id="Despoil_Su">Despoil (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The DCs of saving throws against diseases, poisons, and drugs within 1,000 feet of a ximtal increase by 2.</p>
<h4><span id="Disease_Su">Disease (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature bitten by a ximtal is exposed to a debilitating <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/called">called</a> forsaken agony. As the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> progresses, it causes the sufferer to grow pale and distracted, to suffer increasing loss of sensory input, and to eventually die of ennui induced by isolation and despair. Those who suffer from forsaken agony are strangely contagious to othersâthe sickness can be spread by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>, but only when the creature suffering from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> touches another creature when no other creatures are within line of sight. Forsaken agony is not contagious when the sufferer can see two or more creatures.</p>
<p>When transmitted via contact with another victim, the save DC to resist the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> decreases by 4, so that only a successful DC 27 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save is needed to resist contracting the sickness from an infected host or to avoid its ongoing ravages.</p>
<p><b>Forsaken Agony</b>: Biteâinjury; <em>save</em> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 29; <em>onset</em> immediate; <em>frequency</em> 1/day; <em>effect</em> 1d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Wisdom drain</a> plus sensory loss; <em>cure</em> 2 consecutive saves. Each time a creature fails a saving throw against forsaken agony, it must also roll 1d6 to determine what sense it permanently loses, as follows.</p>

<p>If a creature rolls a result that itâs already suffering from, it instead suffers the next highest result that itâs not currently suffering. A creature that has lost the use of all senses that fails a saving throw against forsaken agony instead takes 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Constitution drain</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a> and does not include the +2 bonus from the ximtalâs despoil ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Isolation_Su">Isolation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a ximtal can attempt to isolate up to four creatures adjacent to it, obstructing the way in which they normally work alongside their allies.</p>
<p>A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. A creature that fails to resist isolation becomes intangible to all creatures it regards as an ally. The target is essentially <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a>, and silenced to its allies, though it canât move through objects and can interact normally with items.</p>
<p>In addition, an isolated creature can no longer see, hear, or perceive creatures it considers allies. The target can see and hear itself, cast spells with verbal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a>, and use command words normally, but any effect that requires allies to see, hear, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> the target doesnât function. Any creature with an attitude of indifferent or worse toward the target or that wishes the target harm can see and interact with the target normally.</p>
<p><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-seeing">True seeing</a> pierces this effect, but <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/see-invisibility">see invisibility</a> canât be used to perceive the targets of this effect. Once every 24 hours, a victim of isolation can attempt a new DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to end the effect. This is a curse effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Look_of_Fear_Su">Look of Fear (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature affected by a ximtalâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked">panicked</a> for 1d6 rounds and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1 minute thereafter, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1 minute on a successful save.</p>
<h4><span id="Miasma_Su">Miasma (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a ximtal can discorporate into a dark, greasy fog that damages creatures caught in it. When a ximtal uses miasma, its space increases to 20 feet and it is treated as if under the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form">gaseous form</a>. A ximtal can remain in miasma form indefinitely and can revert to its solid form as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. Within the miasmaâs space, all sightâincluding <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision">darkvision</a>âis reduced to 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a>, and creatures farther away have total <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a>. On the start of the ximtalâs turn, creatures in the area of its miasma take 4d6 points of damage (this damage bypasses all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance">energy resistance</a>). A successful DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save negates this damage. Any creature within the miasma can attack the ximtal but takes a â4 penalty on its attacks and canât attempt saving throws against the damage from being within the miasma at the start of the ximtalâs next turn. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane">Ethereal Plane</a>)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or fright (3â6)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>While psychopomps usher mortal souls to the proper judgment, sahkils have no care for souls and want to only torment and frighten mortals, often toying with their feelings of unease about their very mortality. Sahkils want to remind mortals that they are just thatâmortal and alone in a complex and dangerous universe.</p>
<p>Ximtals feed on the fear of not belonging, and on the fear of isolation from the rest of a community or society. A ximtal stands 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Ximtals are manipulative schemers by nature. Having no concern whatsoever for any law, and feeling only contempt for joy and freedom as well as a total disdain for the overarching principles of society, a ximtal uses any insecurities and other weaknesses it perceives in order to slowly erode positive thoughts and actions and keep strong-willed mortals from acting on beliefs that would aid the greater good. They foster the vulgar and abusive voices in all sides of a conflict, subjecting the sensible and sensitive to ill treatment from the loud and malignant. These sinister <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> instill feelings of dread and hopelessness, and make people feel as if they were alone and unacknowledged even in the presence of their friends and allies.</p>
<p>Ximtals delight in finding impressionable and aggressive voices to do their work. They know that if they can get someone who thinks she is fighting for a good cause to use terrible tactics in her pursuit of the ideal, they can corrupt that message and seed fear, shame, and dread in what would normally be seen as a constructive endeavor. In this way, ximtals hope to transform the righteous into fanatics.</p>
<p>More subtly, ximtals sometimes focus their attention on friends and allies of the truly virtuousâtheir ultimate targetsâto indirectly discredit these paragons. In these cases, ximtals encourage associates of a target to misrepresent the targetâs intended cause.</p>
<p>They work their way into the minds and ideologies of people who focus their actions on advertising their ideals and motivations; they gradually corrupt such folk, leading them to treat other voices with barely concealed aggression and contempt and make hasty decisions that run counter to their final goals. Eventually, the ximtals hope, these agents of discord will subvert the paragonâs message and mire her in despair and isolation.</p>

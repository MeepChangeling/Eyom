<p>The smilodon, also known as the saber-toothed cat, is a powerful feline predator that savors the flesh of large creatures such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant-mastodon">mastodons</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant-mammoth">mammoths</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant">elephants</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/herd-animals/bison">bison</a>, buffalo, <a class="disabled" href="375c2ff6323156ad">deer</a>, and other great cats (excluding other smilodons). Smilodons are noted scavengers and have no problem devouring another animalâs kill. Animals that resist the smilodon usually become part of the meal as well. Often mistakenly referred to as saber-toothed tigers by adventurers and sages, they are not in fact, related to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/felines/cat-great/tiger">tigers</a> at all.</p>
<p>Breeding season for smilodons takes place year round (that is, they have no set mating period). A male smilodon mates with all females in the den. Gestation lasts about 80 days after which time 1d4+2 cubs are born. Cubs reach maturity around two years of age. Most leave the den and go on their own at this age.</p>
<p>Smilodons average about five feet long and weigh nearly 500 pounds, but can grow to a length of eight feet and weigh up to 900 pounds. Their fur is golden or spotted (similar to a leopard). Their legs are short but powerful and their tail is short and bobbed. The smilodon has two eight-inch long, downward-curving canine teeth. These saber-like fangs are very sharp and are used for stabbing prey. This creature can open its jaws almost twice as far as other big cats. Other great cats, like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/felines/cat-great/lion">lions</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/felines/cat-great/tiger">tigers</a>, can only open their jaws to an angle of about 65-degrees, but the smilodon can stretch its jaws to an angle of 120-degrees. These ferocious hunters prefer to attack from ambush, using their coloration to blend in with their surroundings so they can catch their opponents by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Surprise">surprise</a>. When prey is spotted, the smilodon waits for it to come close, and then leaps to attack. When combating a foe, the saber-tooth bites and rakes with its claws. It uses its long canine teeth to stab its prey, aiming for the fleshier and softer parts of its victimâs body (such as the stomach or neck) where it inflicts terrible wounds with its saber-like teeth.</p>

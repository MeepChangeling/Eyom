<p>Giant pike, like their smaller counterparts, are voracious and often attack prey much larger than themselves. Their diet consists mainly of soft-finned fish, trout, perch, frogs, mice, ducks, birds, and small humanoids. Larger prey includes humanoids, other giant fish, deer, and sheep or goats. Giant pike have no qualms about eating those of their own kind, especially when food is scarce.</p>
<p>The giant pike hides in weeds, behind rocks, or some other such cover, waiting for potential prey to wander nearby. It coils its body into an âSâ position, and when prey passes by, strikes with blinding speed, biting with its sharp teeth. If the pike gets a hold on prey smaller than itself, it swallows it.</p>

<p>This horse-sized housefly has a vulture’s neck growing out of its body, capped with a fleshless vulture skull.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Detach-Head-Su-"></a>Detach Head (Su)</h4>
<p>A sarcovalt can survive without its head.</p>
<p>Attacks that sever its head (such as those of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/vorpal">vorpal</a> weapon) do not kill it. If attacked by multiple creatures, it grapples one opponent, detaches its head (which continues to drain blood), and uses its body to continue attacking with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>. Its head and body share a common pool of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> but are otherwise treated as different creatures while separated. The head is AC 19, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> 15, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a> 16 (+3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dex</a>, +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural</a>, +2 size) and can <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fly">fly</a> at the creature’s normal <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed">speed</a>. The head cannot initiate attacks on its own, and if removed from a target, it flies back to the body on its next turn. The body cannot see, but it can perceive through the head’s eye cavities if it has line of effect to the head.</p>

<p>Sarcovalts are disgusting carrion-eating creatures that pick over the filth and the remnants of devoured souls in her planar realm. They have little personal identity and barely remember events more than a few hours old. While they are intelligent enough to converse and recognize their own kind and other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a>, they tend to think of other creatures as either threats or food. Sarcovalts sometimes work together to kill larger prey, but are usually content to eat scraps left behind by more powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>.</p>
<p>A sarcovalt resembles an enormous fly with a vulture’s neckâbut instead of a fleshy head, its head is the naked skull of a vulture with glistening black eyes.</p>
<p>When its skull is detached, its bald neck ends in a stump of tattered flesh. It savors the opportunity to drink blood, but cannot swallow it, and therefore its skull is normally painted with the life-fluid of its victims. In their eagerness to shred bodies, especially living flesh, these eager scavengers often get small treasure like amulets, rings, and other equipment worn close to the body trapped within their skulls. After letting such items rattle around in their heads for a few days, they unceremoniously vomit them up coated in the vile remains of their last several meals. Sarcovalts use their skulls similarly to how psychopomps wear masks.</p>
<p>Sarcovalts are frequently summoned to serve either as scouts and sentinels, or as menaces to sow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> in places they seek to terrorize. In the best cases, a single sarcovalt can spread <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> resulting in the deaths of dozens, giving priests ample bodies to raise as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> or use in more terrible plots when they reveal themselves.</p>
<p>Sarcovalts measure 2 feet long and weigh 5 pounds.</p>

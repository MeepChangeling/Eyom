<h1>Fetch</h1>
<p class="description">A ragged-looking and rotting humanoid leaps from the snow, its filthy nails slashing through the frosty air. Its eyes are stark blue and its skin is pale white. Ice hangs from its scraggly hair.</p>

<p>A fetch is a ruthless opponent, slashing its foes with its wicked claws. Fetches always fight to the death, but are smart enough to flee when presented with fire, if they cannot attack the opponent wielding the fire. If a fetch flees from an encounter because of fire, it follows the one who presented the fire (lurking in the shadows, hiding in cover) and eventually exacts its revenge.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Freezing-Touch-Su-"></a>Freezing Touch (Su)</h4>
<p>A fetchâs touch is supernaturally cold. It deals an extra 1d4 points of cold damage with each claw attack.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold plains, hills and mountains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>When a murdered person is buried on frozen ground, it often returns from the grave as a fetch, an evil undead monster with a hatred of fire and the living. Fetches seek out living creatures that wander too close to their lair, kill them, and often bury them in hope that they rise from their frozen resting place as a fetch. Slain foes not buried are dragged to the fetchâs lair and devoured. Fetches savor the flesh of humanoids and monstrous humanoids, in particular humans, elves, and centaurs. A fetch stands anywhere from 5 to 7 feet tall and weighs between 100 and 250 pounds. Its clothes are tattered and worn with age and exposure. Its rotting flesh is drawn tight around its bones and flushed grayish-white. Its hair is scraggly and frozen and ice crystals cover its skin. A fetchâs eyes are stark blue.</p>

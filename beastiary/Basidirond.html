<h4><a name="TOC-Hallucination-Cloud-Ex-"></a><b>Hallucination Cloud (Ex)</b></h4>
<p>As a standard action once per minute, a basidirond can release a cloud of invisible spores in a 20-foot radius. All creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be affected by powerful hallucinations as long as they remain in the cloud plus 1d4 rounds after leaving the area. A new save must be made each round a creature remains within the affected area. A hallucination cloud persists for 5 rounds before dispersingâa strong wind causes it to disperse immediately. The save DC is Constitution-based. To determine what hallucination is suffered each round, roll 1d6 and consult the following table.</p>
<p><b>d6 Hallucination</b></p>
<ol>
<li>You’re sinking in quicksand! Fall prone and spend 1 round flailing your arms and legs as if trying to swim.</li>
<li>Attacked by a swarm of spiders! Spend a full round action to attack the floor near you with your weapon.</li>
<li>An item you hold has turned into a viper! Drop it and flee from the item at top speed for 1 round.</li>
<li>You’re suffocating! Stand in place, hold your breath, and clutch at your throat for 1 round.</li>
<li>You’ve shrunk to 1/10th your normal size! Take no actions for 1 round and monsters won’t see you.</li>
<li>You’re melting! Grasp hold of yourself in an attempt to hold yourself together, and take no actions for 1 round.</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="TOC-Spores-Ex-"></a><b>Spores (Ex)</b></h4>
<p>Any creature struck by a basidirond’s slam attack is coated with spores. The creature struck must make a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or these spores take root in his flesh, and particularly in his lungs. The save DC is Constititon-based. </p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Cold-Lethargy-Ex-"></a><b>Cold Lethargy (Ex)</b></h4>
<p>Although a basidirond is immune to cold damage, any cold effect it is exposed to slows it for 1d4 rounds. During this time, the basidirond cannot use its hallucination cloud or spores.</p>

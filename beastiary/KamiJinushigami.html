<p>Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a> a jinushigami wields functions as a +5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a> (unless the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a> already has a greater <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement bonus</a>). If a jinushigami is within its regional ward, it can create a Gargantuan <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a> out of the surrounding terrain as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Manipulate_Terrain_Su"><a name="TOC-Manipulate-Terrain-Su-"></a>Manipulate Terrain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A jinushigami can help any number of creatures travel within its territory. Creatures aided in this way receive a +10 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> checks and do not suffer reductions to overland movement from terrain or lack of a highway or other roadway, regardless of the presence of roads or the type of terrain they actually travel through. Alternatively, a jinushigami can make terrain more difficult for any number of creatures to travel through, imparting a -10 penalty on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> checks and causing overland movement to be reduced to one-tenth its normal speed. A jinushigami can affect as many creatures as it wishes with this ability, selecting whether it aids or impedes travel for each, as long as it can notice the creature and the creature is within its regional ward. A jinushigami may use this ability while merged with its ward.</p>
<h4><span id="Ward_Su"><a name="TOC-Ward-Su-"></a>Ward (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A jinushigami treats an entire region as its ward. This region can be a single forest, swamp, mountain, lake, or any other natural feature, with a maximum radius of 5 miles. Most jinushigami have smaller regional wards, since not all regions are large enough to fill this area, but no region with a radius smaller than 1 mile radius can support (or deserves) a jinushigami. As long as it is within its territory (either merged with it or in its physical form), a jinushigami can observe the world from any point within its regional ward as if it were at that point. While merged with its ward, it can observe all points simultaneously in this way. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, it can convey information about a creature within its ward (effectively imparting a description and exact location) to all kami within its regional ward.</p>
<h3><span id="Variants">Variants</span></h3>
<p><b>Elder Junushigami</b>: Of all the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/kami">kami</a>, land <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/kami">kami</a> are the most ancient and powerful, yet even among these immense <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> there are variations in that power. Newly formed jinushigami have statistics as presented above, but a jinushigami grows more powerful as the legend and fame of the site it guards grows. For example, a jinushigami of part of a mountain range is impressive, but a jinushigami whose region includes the range’s tallest mountain is even more so.</p>
<p>When a jinushigami becomes this powerful, it is known as an elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami is generally a Colossal creature, and rarely has fewer than 28 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>âmost are between CR 22 and CR 25, although exact details vary. An elder jinushigami’s ward can cover a much larger area than that of a typical jinushigami, usually with a radius of 1 mile per CR possessed by the elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami also gains additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> to more closely reflect its role in the world. Listed below are several examples.</p>
<p><b>Glacier Kami</b>: An elder jinushigami associated with a vast glacier, be it one that carves mountains or runs along a polar coastline, appears as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> made of blocks of ice. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/kami">kami</a> have the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Cold">cold subtype</a> instead of the earth subtype (and thus gain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to cold and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> to fire), and can use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/cone-of-cold">cone of cold</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wall-of-ice">wall of ice</a> as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> three times per day each.</p>
<p><b>Great Reef Kami</b>: An elder jinushigami whose domain contains a sizable coral reef of considerable age appears as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> constructed of living coral draped with seaweed. Great reef kami have the water subtype instead of the earth subtype, gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic subtype</a> (and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Amphibious-Ex-">amphibious</a> special quality), gain a swim speed of 60 ft., and gain the ability to use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tsunami">tsunami</a> (Advanced Player’s Guide 251) once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>.</p>
<p><b>Mountain Kami</b>: When an elder jinushigami’s ward includes the tallest peak in a range or region, it gains the use of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/flesh-to-stone">flesh to stone</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wall-of-stone">wall of stone</a> three times per day each.</p>
<p><b>Volcano Kami</b>: An elder jinushigami that includes in its ward an active volcano appears as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> made of equal parts molten rock and solid stone. A volcano kami has the fire subtype instead of the earth subtype (and thus gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to fire and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> to cold), can use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fireball">fireball</a> three times per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>, and can use <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wall-of-lava">wall of lava</a> (Advanced Player’s Guide 255) once per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> triple </p> Guardians of significant natural wonders like mountains, large lakes, forests, and so on, jinushigami (known also as land 
 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/kami">kami</a>) are the most powerful and revered of all 
 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/kami">kami</a>, commanding the very forces of nature itself to ensure the safety and security of their wards. These potent spirits garner the most respect among other 
 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/kami">kami</a>, wielding great influence over both them and the 
 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Native">native</a> creatures that dwell within their territories. Jinushigami tend to stay hidden amongst their land, however, knowing that their intimate tie with the environment makes them highly desirable targets among those who would seek to do harm to nature. 
 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/kami">kami</a>, such as the 
 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a>, do not receive this friendly grace period, and a jinushigami can perceive most treacherous thoughts, sensing a suspicious visitor through its connection with the land, then tracking it down to stealthily observe it more closely. 
 <p>A jinushigami is 38 feet tall and weighs over 30,000 pounds. When they manifest physical bodies, they appear as lumbering <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> forms made of earth and stone and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> matter, sometimes with strange <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> affectations like hats or jewelry.</p>

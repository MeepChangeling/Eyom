<h1>Hungry Fog</h1>
<p class="description">Horrid shapes form within this cloying green mist, which pulses sporadically and with seeming voracity.</p>

<p>Any creature within 10 feet of a hungry fog or currently being affected by its enveloping mists must succeed on a DC 8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save at the start of that creature’s turn or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1 round at the half-glimpsed shapes of phantoms floating within the fog. This is a mind-affecting <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear">fear</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>

<p>A hungry fog can engulf foes. A creature engulfed by a hungry fog does not gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> condition and may move normallyâsuch a creature is not in danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> in addition to the damage the attack causes. The save DC to avoid the enveloping mists is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Gaseous_Ex"><a name="TOC-Gaseous-Ex-"></a>Gaseous (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>)</span></h4>
<p>A hungry fog has a body composed of eerie mist. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> score, and cannot manipulate objects as a result.</p>
<h4><span id="Vulnerable_to_Wind_Ex"><a name="TOC-Vulnerable-to-Wind-Ex-"></a>Vulnerable to Wind (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>)</span></h4>
<p>A hungry fog is treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any temperate<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or bank (3-10)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>This eerie, vaporous <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> slips silently through the air, a roiling cloud of green fog within which dance the indistinct shapes of twisted, spooky <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghost">ghosts</a>. Despite its haunting appearance, and despite the fact that hungry fogs often dwell in old graveyards or hunt battlefields, a hungry fog is not an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature. Rather, it is a form of gaseous <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> infused with negative energy. Thus, while a hungry fog is not an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> gain considerable boons by fighting within a hungry fog, for its mists heal them as surely as they drain vitality from the living creatures caught within.</p>
<p>Within a hungry fog, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze’s</a> mists interact strangely with fragments of those it has consumed, creating eerie phantasms of its past victims. Periodically, one of these shapes might flash with light as if momentarily holding a lantern aloft, but as soon as the figure is approached, it fades away into the surrounding mists, often giving the observer a quick and unsettling glimpse of a skull-like countenance. These shapes, like the fog itself, are not truly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, but the fact that a hungry fog is hurt by positive energy as surely as if it were helps to blur the distinction and spread even more confusion about its actual nature.</p>
<p>A hungry fog is instinctively drawn to areas where negative energy is strong. These nocturnal creatures are particularly fond of sites that are haunted, such as old houses, abandoned graveyards, or shipwrecks along shorelinesâalthough their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> to high winds means that they are rarely encountered in areas where storms are common.</p>

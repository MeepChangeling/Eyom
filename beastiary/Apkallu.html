<h4><a name="TOC-Archive-Su-"></a>Archive (Su)</h4>
<p>By concentrating for 1 minute without interruption, an apkallu can conjure the door to a personal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> archive in which it collects and preserves the lore generated by the civilizations it guides. An apkallu’s archive is similar to an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-heroes/archmage">archmage’s</a> sanctum but is 2,000 cubic feet in size. By spending one use of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power">mythic power</a> as a full-round action, the apkallu can instantly record up to nine non-magical writings (books, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls">scrolls</a>, carvings, and so on) that it is touching or carrying within tomes in the archive.</p>
<p>If an apkallu is killed or rendered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> (even if its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-">regeneration</a> is still active), its body and any items it is carrying are immediately transported to its archive. An apkallu can conjure the door to the archive of a slain apkallu at the location of the slain apkallu’s death.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Mark-of-Restraint-Su-"></a>Mark of Restraint (Su)</h4>
<p>An apkallu that successfully bites an opponent can spend one use of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power">mythic power</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> to mark that opponent with a restraining effect.</p>
<p>This effects acts like a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mark-of-justice">mark of justice</a> that triggers if the opponent attacks the apkallu; the opponent is instantly aware of this condition. If the opponent attacks the apkallu, the mark’s curse is activated and imposes a permanent â4 penalty on the opponent’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Mythic-Spell-Like-Abilities-Ex-"></a>Mythic Spell-Like Abilities (Ex)</h4>
<p>An apkallu can expend uses of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power">mythic power</a> to use the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic">mythic</a> version of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/o/order-s-wrath">order’s wrath</a> as if the ability were a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic">mythic</a> spell.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Paralyzing-Gaze-Su-"></a>Paralyzing Gaze (Su)</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Paralysis-Ex-or-Su-">Paralysis</a> for 1 round, 30 feet, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> DC 30 negates. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. If an apkallu actively directs its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a>, a targeted creature is instead <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed">paralyzed</a> for 1d6 rounds, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for the same duration on a successful save. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Lawful">Lawful</a> creatures are immune to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Scale-Surplice-Su-"></a>Scale Surplice (Su)</h4>
<p>Apkallus wear robes of opalescent scales that function as +2 resonating scale mail with no armor check penalty, and that grant the wearer a swim speed of 40 feet, the ability to breathe water, and the ability to treat <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim">Swim</a> as a class skill. The surplice is absorbed into an alternate form if the apkallu changes shape, and if removed, it becomes a mundane cloth robe until worn again by an apkallu. If an apkallu’s scale surplice is destroyed, it can create a new one from water by spending nine uses of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power">mythic power</a> after 1d4 hours of uninterrupted crafting.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Spells"></a>Spells</h4>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (lawful planes)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (+2 <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/axiomatic">axiomatic</a> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/keen">keen</a> potent bronze <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/spear">spear</a>, other treasure)</p>
<p>Rather than simply teaching mortals such knowledge, apkallus prefer to act as advisors, nudging those who would develop key techniques toward important discoveries, ensuring that the civilizations within their care don’t come to rely on their instruction. Apkallus can communicate with any intelligent creature by using <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-">telepathy</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mindlink">mindlink</a>. They are particularly fond of using shared mindscapes to grant inspiring visions of possible futures to their charges, modeling an array of potential developments in an immersive medium that transcends dry theory and exposition.</p>
<p>Apkallus are also archivists and preservationists, carefully recording the key historical documents that describe the progress of mortal societies so that knowledge and progress can be restored following natural disasters or periods of war or barbarism. They take great care to ensure that their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extradimensional-Spaces">extradimensional</a> archives remain well-protected, understanding that certain information, or even knowledge of the existence of that information, can undermine a civilization’s progress and self-reliance. Whenever possible, apkallus ensure that the material collected in their personal archives is transferred to the grand library vaults within <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Utopia-Lawful-Neutral-">Utopia</a>. Here, they and their allies can analyze the information collected across myriad cultures and devise strategies for advancing the cause of law and order throughout the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>.</p>
<p>Apkallus appear as large, muscular <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> with the feathered heads of raptors, and with powerful, hawk-like wings. They dress in surplices of fish scales, which glitter with a milky iridescence that casts shimmering rainbows across their forms, and they typically carry magical bronze spears. They can also adopt two alternate formsâone <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a>, and one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-merfolk">merfolk</a>âin which they move through terrestrial and aquatic settlements and cities, respectively.</p>
<p>While apkallus are peaceful by nature, they are nevertheless capable of defending themselves and others with powerful magic, especially in defense of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Utopia-Lawful-Neutral-">Utopia</a> or mortal cities under their protection.</p>

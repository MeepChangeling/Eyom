<h1>Deific Guard</h1>
<p style="font-style: italic">What at first appears to be a simple uninteresting humanoid skull suddenly rises from its resting place, turning slowly in your direction to reveal gems inset in its eye sockets and jaw, and releasing a maniacal cackle.</p>

<p>This ability works like the cleric ability of the same name The deific guard channels energy as a 13th-level cleric.</p>
<h4><span id="Gold_and_Silver_Battleaxe"><a name="TOC-Gold-and-Silver-Battleaxe-"></a>Gold and Silver Battleaxe</span></h4>
<p>A gold and silver battleaxe provides a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks, counts as an alchemical silver weapon, is always considered masterwork, and costs 360 gp (before adding the cost of any magical enhancements).</p>
<h4><span id="Mummy_Rot_Su"><a name="TOC-Mummy-Rot-Su-"></a>Mummy Rot (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Curse and diseaseâslam; save <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 34; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> and 1d6 Cha; cure â. Mummy rot is both a curse and disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element of mummy rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted creature must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check, or the spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from mummy rot turns to dust and cannot be raised without a resurrection or greater magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>

<p>As the pharaohs of long ago ascended to godhood, they took their royal guards with them. Deific guards, as they were known, were mummified guardians left behind to protect the remains of the pharaoh or those that ascended into Abaddon with the ancient ruler. These warrior-priests are the unliving incarnation of the ancient pharaoh they once served. While many ancient tombs are protected by lesser guardians, deific guards were chosen by truly powerful rulers to defend them on their way to the afterlife and godhood.</p>
<p>Only dwarves were chosen as deific guards in life, and they still retain some of their dwarf racial abilities in undeath.</p>
<p>A deific guard stands about 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Double-Weapon-Mastery-Ex-"></a>Double Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h4>
<p>An atamahuta fights with an orc double axe. While making a full attack, an atamahuta controls its arms with both heads and does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with a double weapon.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Spellstrike-Su-"></a>Spellstrike (Su)</h4>
<p>An atamahuta can imbue its weapon with magical properties using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>. Whenever an atamahuta casts a spell with a range of â<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>â from its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, it can deliver the spell through any weapon it is holding as part of a free melee attack at its highest <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus">base attack bonus</a> as part of casting its spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. This attack uses the weapon’s critical multiplier (usually Ã3), but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier. An atamahuta cannot make a full attack during the same round that it uses a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> unless another effect would allow it to do so.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Ward-Off-Distractions-Ex-"></a>Ward Off Distractions (Ex)</h4>
<p>An atamahuta uses one of its heads to defend against attacks while the other is using a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>, giving it a +4 bonus to AC against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> while casting.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate mountains<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or cohort (1â2 plus 3â5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ettin">ettins</a>)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> double (banded mail, +2 orc double axe, other treasure)</p>
<p>Atamahuta are immensely strong <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> spirits who have donned the physical guise of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ettin">ettins</a>. Combining <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a>‘s trademark guile with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ettin">ettins</a>‘ unadulterated brawn, atamahuta use their two-headed forms to inflict as much damage as possible by fusing their arcane powers with their distinctive melee combat style.</p>
<p>Because of the raw power they infuse into the bodies they inhabit, atamahuta are slightly bigger than normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ettin">ettins</a>. An atamahuta is 14 feet tall and weighs 5,500 pounds.</p>

<p>When atamahuta establish slave rings, they often make a business of selling their prisoners to the highest bidder in private auctions and black market deals. Occasionally, atamahuta will also run economically viable businesses on the side, putting their enslaved minions to work in remote fields or mines far from civilization. Atamahuta are rarely content to remain rulers over a stagnant position, and seek to advance their dominion as far as possible. Their prowess for ruthless business tactics and intimidating rivals into positions of subservience makes them potent forces in whatever realm they seek to control. Atamahuta often join merchants’ guilds and other such organizations after starting their slave rings, creating legitimate business fronts in order to infiltrate the guilds and wrest control of them. With this power, they can impose seemingly fair taxes upon their competitors, ultimately running them out of business and establishing themselves as the sole means of trade within a community. Of course, they must do this all through surrogates, as few trade organizations would permit an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> or an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ettin">ettin</a> into their ranks, and even then, many guilds have imposed strict rules regarding representatives into their systems in order to prevent such atamahuta-run monopolies from developing in the first place.</p>
<p>Atamahuta are typically distrustful of other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a>, as they see them as potential threats to their power, and thus only rarely ally themselves with other such beings. Occasionally, however, such alliances can prove to be mutually beneficial, and so atamahuta team up with weaker <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> such as yamabushi tengus or kuwa, so that they can reap the rewards of such a coalition while still retaining the most power. More intelligent or powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> recognize atamahuta for their oblivious nature and will often manipulate the beings for their strength, tricking the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ettin">ettin</a>-shaped <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> into thinking they are dominant in the friendship until the more powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> has used the atamahuta for their intended purpose, at which point the beings are swiftly discarded.</p>

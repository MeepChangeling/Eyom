<h1>Adaro</h1>
<p class="description">This hybrid of human and shark holds its spear menacingly, thick, glistening saliva dripping from its razor-sharp teeth.</p>

<h4><span id="Poison_Ex"><a name="TOC-Poison-Ex-"></a>Poison (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Adaros favor a paralytic toxin secreted by the flying nettlefin pufferfishâa sticky venom that doesn’t wash away in water.</p>

<h4><span id="Poison_Use_Ex"><a name="TOC-Poison-Use-Ex-"></a>Poison Use (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Adaros are skilled in the use of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves.</p>
<h4><span id="Rain_Frenzy_Su"><a name="TOC-Rain-Frenzy-Su-"></a>Rain Frenzy (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Adaros revere storms, and their lust for blood is amplified exponentially while it is raining. While fighting in the rain or during other stormy weather, adaros act as though affected by the rage spell. An adaro gains this benefit even if it is underwater, but only as long as it remains within a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a> away from the water’s surface (50 feet for most adaros).</p>
<h4><span id="Speak_with_Sharks_Su"><a name="TOC-Speak-with-Sharks-Su-"></a>Speak with Sharks (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An adaro can communicate telepathically with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/shark/shark">sharks</a> to a distance of 100 feet. This communication is limited to simple concepts, such as “come,” “defend,” or “attack.”</p>

<p>Malevolent denizens of the waters, adaros are among the fiercest sentient hunters of the tropical seas. They are known and feared by sailors on many exotic shores, as well as by common folk who just happen to live near the ocean. Many have witnessed a fellow sailor or fisher suddenly go rigid, a poisoned spear jutting from his guts, only to fall into the water and be taken by the vicious adaro responsible for the assault.</p>
<p>Strictly carnivorous, adaros feed upon their victims almost immediately after slaying them. Their brutally sharp teeth cut through bone almost as easily as through flesh, and their powerful digestive systems are capable of handling most organic matter. Adaros usually eat once every couple of days, gorging on meals half their weight.</p>
<p>Adaros’ strange relationship with storms has intrigued scholars for centuries. These sea-dwellers have a special connection to the deadly creatures of the water and the wildness of foul weather, and it is no coincidence that they attack <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> more often during rough seas. Adaros are seminomadic by nature; a tribe travels until it finds a suitable hunting ground, and leaves either when its presence becomes too well known or when its game runs low.</p>
<p>An adaro is 7-1/2 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.</p>
<p>Malevolent humanoids of the waters, adaros are among the fiercest sentient hunters of the tropical reaches. Their terror is known and feared by sailors on many exotic shores, as well as by many common folk who just happen to live near the ocean. Many have witnessed a fellow sailor or fisher suddenly go rigid, a poisoned spear jutting from his guts, only to fall into the water and be taken by the vicious adaro responsible.</p>

<p>Striking with sharp spearsâthe heads of which typically come from whale bones or the spines of large sea creaturesâmost adaros coat their weapons with the poison of the deadly nettlefin pufferfish. This sticky venom is a strong paralytic that has a seizing effect on most creatures. Thanks to exposure to it from a young age, adaros are immune to nettlefin toxin, and so are never at risk of paralyzing themselves while working with it. </p>

<p>Adarosâ strange relationship with storms has mesmerized and intrigued scholars for centuries. These sea-dwellers have an especial connection to the deadly creatures of the water and the wildness of foul weather, and it is not by coincidence that they attack humanoids more often during rough seas. Adaros universally worship the deity of the sea and weather, and fly into a frenzy when the rain clouds overhead become dark and let loose their tears. One of the more accepted theories regarding adarosâ connection with the rain suggests that the hunters of the sea are manifested from the chaos of the Winds and Waves in some distant ocean beyond the horizon. When it rains, the bond between the two aspects strengthens and drives adaros into a fury akin to the storm that initiated the turbulence. </p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Adaros are semi-nomadic by nature; tribes travel until they find a suitable hunting ground, and leave either when their presence becomes too well known or when their game runs low. Although they have been seen on the high seas, the wandering tribes tend to stay close to shore, sometimes venturing out to raid ships leaving nearby ports. Having stealthily trailed behind a vessel for miles, waiting to strike until the boat and its passengers are too far from shore to receive immediate aid, a band of adaros swiftly and without warning attacks those onboard. Depending on the size of the ship, any number of adaros might participate in this raid, from a single hunter to dozens. The water-dwelling predators choose their targets carefully and strategically.</p>
<p>This is not to say those onshore are safe from the well-aimed spears of adaros. Small portside towns suffer from the occasional adaro attack, their unprotected docks easy targets for lone adaros. Larger cities have also seen their fair share of the aquatic hunters, as bands of adaros assail unwary dockworkers or any who visit the beach past dusk.</p>
<p>The commonality between all places adaros gravitate toward, however, is the weather. Adaros live only in waters that experience rain at least semi-frequently, and so are rarely found in such places as desert-lined coasts or frozen, arctic waters. During the rainy season, adaros behave in an almost completely different manner than usual, their tactical nature overrun by primal instinct and bloodlust. When the weather gets rough, adaros lose their inhibitions and thirst only for another kill, but it is universally understood that killing an adaro within oneâs own tribe is strictly taboo, and is punished by death with almost no exceptions.</p>
<h3><span id="Adaros_in_Mythology"><a name="TOC-Adaros-in-Mythology"></a>Adaros in Mythology</span></h3>
<p>Originating from Solomon Island mythology, adaros are thought to be the evil aspect of a humanâs soul, manifested in the form of half-fish, half-human sea spirits that live on the sun and travel to Earth via rainbows. From these prismatic bridges, adaros hurl poisoned sawfish at fishers or sailors, knocking their victims unconscious or killing them. In mythology, the adaro has a shark-fin horn, as well as a spearfish-like spike growing out of the back of its head, and at times, these sea spirits visit people in their dreams, teaching them new songs and dances.</p>

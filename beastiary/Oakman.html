<p>Oakmen are small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> that are said to be the spirits of oak trees. An oakman is a foul-tempered curmudgeon, gruff and cantankerous. These grouchy creatures are usually seen sitting up on a thick branch in an oak tree calling down insults and crude comments to those who pass by. Some say that the grumpy old oakmen are the male versions of the beautiful dryads. This may or may not be true, but it would certainly explain why dryads would rather take human mates.</p>
<p>Oakmen are generally content to sit in their trees and watch the world go by, venturing out only if their forest is threatened. They also enjoy creeping out of the forest to trick some fool human into eating magical cakes made from moss and mushrooms just to see what will happen to him.</p>
<p>Oakmen are scrappy and prone to combat despite their small size. They willingly fight if they must, but, like most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>, prefer to use magic rather than melee.</p>

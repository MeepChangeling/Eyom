<p>Burning dervishes are the fanatical minions of the Sultan of Efreet (see the City of Brass by <a href="http://www.necromancergames.com/" target="_blank">Necromancer Games</a>). It is said that the burning dervishes were once a noble tribe of jann who sold their souls to the Sultan of Efreet in exchange for greater power over the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elemental-Planes">Elemental Planes</a> of Fire.</p>
<p>Burning dervishes are virtually indistinguishable from human beings, and indeed spend a great amount of time in the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> as agents of the Sultan of Efreet, seeking to spread worship of the Sultan as true God of Elemental Fire. Other tasks of the burning dervishes are as assassins and spies, often leading daring sneak attacks against foes of the Sultan or procuring powerful relics for his pleasure.</p>
<p>The burning dervishes have a citadel atop the Great Ziggurat of the City of Brass which serves as the central temple to their zealous faith. It is from this ziggurat that the Sultan communes with his worshippers, sending them out on jihads throughout the planes to further his name and power.</p>
<p>Burning dervishes usually turn themselves <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> before attacking in an attempt to catch their foes by surprise. In combat, the burning dervish attacks with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/falchion">falchion</a>. Depending on the power of its opponent, a burning dervish either uses <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/enlarge-person">enlarge person</a> on itself or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/reduce-person">reduce person</a> on its opponent. A burning dervish that is outclassed or overmatched either takes to the air and flees or attempts to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plane-shift">plane shift</a> to escape.</p>

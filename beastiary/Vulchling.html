<p>Vulchlings prefer to attack from secret or ambush by lying in wait for their prey and then swooping in to attack with their razor-sharp talons and beak. Slain opponents are carried back to the vulchlings’ lair and fed to the young vulchlings.</p>

<p>Vulchlings are a malevolent race of avian creatures akin to the vulture. Their faces, though bird-like, seem to have an almost human quality to them. Vulchlings are not only scavengers but also predators, feeding on living prey as well as carrion. Vulchlings can occasionally be found in the company of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/harpy">harpies</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/vrock">vrocks</a>, but most of their time is spent in their lairs – usually large nests found deep within the earth.</p>

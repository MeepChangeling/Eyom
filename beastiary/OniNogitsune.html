<h1>Oni, Nogitsune</h1>
<p class="description">This fox-headed humanoid has a sleek, feminine form that moves with seductive grace. As she steps into a defensive posture, a mass of bushy tails flicks at the air above her back and she reveals teeth flecked with blood.</p>

<h4><span id="Contagious_Whisper_Su"><a name="TOC-Contagious-Whisper-Su-"></a>Contagious Whisper (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a nogitsune can influence a target she speaks to as per the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a>. The target must succeed at a DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be affected by this effect. In addition to being subject to suggestionâs normal effects, any creature affected by the contagious whisper can pass the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment">enchantment</a> on to other targets. Doing so requires the target to communicate the nogitsuneâs suggestion, forcing the new target to save as if it were the initial target. If such a secondary target resists the contagious whisper, it is unaffected, but this does not remove the suggestion from the initial target. Failing the save puts another creature under the nogitsuneâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a>. Newly affected creatures are also able to spread the suggestion. A nogitsuneâs compelling whisper can affect a number of creatures equal to the its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> and lasts for a number of hours equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. Creatures that successfully save versus the nogitsuneâs compelling whisper (as a primary or secondary target) cannot be affected by that particular nogitsuneâs compelling whisper for 24 hours. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Fleet_Distraction_Su"><a name="TOC-Fleet-Distraction-Su-"></a>Fleet Distraction (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A nogitsune can make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff">Bluff</a> check or use its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/o/obscuring-mist">obscuring mist</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> in any round in which it moves up to half its base land speed.</p>
<h4><span id="Poison_Use_Ex"><a name="TOC-Poison-Use-Ex-"></a>Poison Use (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Nogitsune are skilled in the use of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Their aptitude is such that they often paint their weapons and nails with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison/blue-whinnis">blue whinnis</a>.</p>
<p><b>Blue Whinnis</b>: injury; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 14; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 2 rounds; <i>initial effect</i> 1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> damage; <i>secondary effect</i> unconsciousness for 1d3 hours; <i>cure</i> 1 save.</p>
<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/extras/community-use/d20pfsrd-com-source-logos#TOC-Source-Pathfinder-Accessory"> </a>
<p><b>Environment</b> any urban<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> double (four masterwork darts, 5 doses of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison/blue-whinnis">blue whinnis poison</a>, other treasure) </p>
<p>Nogitsune are created when <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> spirits take over the bodies of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-kitsune">kitsune</a> (sagacious humanoid fox-creatures). The resultant possession creates a creature with the kitsuneâs foxlike grace and cunning and infuses it with the destructive power of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a>. Nogitsune are always female, and resemble shapely <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a> with a covering of fur and a foxâs head. A nogitsuneâs fur color varies and can be orange and white, grey, pure white, or even black. Whenever nogitsune use their shapechanging abilities to assume a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> form, they still evince somewhat pointed, vulpine features. In addition, any hair on their assumed form betrays the natural coloration of their pelts. Nogitsune stand between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds.</p>
<p>Although they often don <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> form to disguise themselves for the purpose of infiltration, nogitsune prefer to stalk and kill prey in their natural form. This gives the creatures the choice of whether to use manufactured weapons or their own sharp claws and deadly bite. When wielding weapons, all nogitsune enjoy using <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>, whenever possible employing toxins and venoms that do not kill outright (unless a contract so requires it) but rather render the victims <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a>. This gives the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> the joy of dealing the killing blow with their jaws and slaking their bloodlust in abject savagery.</p>
<p>A nogitsuneâs most feared weapon, however, is its contagious whisper. This powerful compulsion, often whispered into the victimâs ear in honeyed tones, not only forces the targeted creature to believe whatever lie the nogitsune crafts, but also infects the subject of the contagious whisper with a corruptive echo of deceit that causes the victim to unknowingly pass on the nogitsuneâs suggestion to others. Nogitsune may use this ability to convince a successive series of servants to open all of the doors to a well-guarded castle, or to make a host of witnesses believe they saw an innocent man commit a brutal crime that was really the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oniâs</a> own handiwork.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Nogitsune inhabit large urban areas, where they can have their pick of a nearly endless stream of victims. Occasionally they will inhabit a town or village in the countryside, but such locales are always in the shadow of a large castle or estate that can provide additional opportunities to stalk and murder others. Wherever they choose to dwell, nogitsune lair in the seediest districts, where drugs, brothels, and crime are rampant. These areas not only discourage chase by would-be pursuers, but also place the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> in the midst of people who society generally doesnât miss if and when a contract doesnât slake the creatureâs bloodlust.</p>
<p>Those looking to hire a nogitsune can do so, but such a practice is both costly and dangerous. Although little binds a nogitsune to its accepted contract when it receives payment, most nogitsune happily carry out their orders for the sheer joy of bringing death to another. But many who foolishly hire nogitsune to do their killing find themselves the next victim once the initial target is slain. Nogitsune have little honor, and such treachery not only feeds their bloodlust, but also leaves fewer witnesses.</p>
<p>Nogitsune prefer to lead solitary lives and be in command of their own foul fates. Thus, most avoid associating with more powerful creatures, other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a>, or even other nogitsune. Those honorable samurai and good ninja who have fought and killed nogitsune recount seeing a conflicted and turbulent anger within the creatures, as if the once-righteous <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-kitsune">kitsune</a> within a nogitsune constantly battles to reassert control. Although there is no record of such a reversal occurring, many believe that these malevolent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni">oni</a> drown themselves in death and bloodshed in order to extinguish the last vestiges of the creatures they were before.</p>

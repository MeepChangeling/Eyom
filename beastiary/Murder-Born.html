<h1>Murder-Born</h1>
<p class="description">Appearing from nowhere arises a ghostly image with translucent, yet delicate features. Its unholy eyes rage with absolute and thorough evil that reflects its hatred for the living. </p>

<p>Spawned of hatred when both mother and child are murdered, the rapacious soul of the unborn sometimes rises as a foul and corrupt spirit. It is bent on exacting revenge against its killers and against all living creatures it crosses. Driven mad by its unliving existence, the murderborn has blurred its senses into believing that every living creature is responsible for its current state and it never hesitates to attack any that come within range of it.</p>
<p>A murder-born is always encountered within 500 feet of the place it was killed, and can never move further away than that. It is a solitary creature, though very rarely, when twins are involved, two of these cursed creatures may be encountered together. Neither is aware of the other’s presence; they do not communicate, interact, or even see each other. They are oblivious to the other’s existence. Whether this is because the creatures are so driven with rage it blinds them, or because some magical and mystical force prevents them from interacting is unknown. Murderborns do not speak or communicate but seem to understand a variety of languages.</p>
<p>A murder-born closes quickly when it detects living creatures in its realm. Once it and at least one opponent are within 60 feet of one another, it unleashes its despondent wail. It then moves to melee range and uses its incorporeal touch to destroy its enemies. Unless driven away or its opponents flee, a murder-born attacks relentlessly until it is destroyed.</p>

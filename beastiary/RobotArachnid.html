<h1>Robot, Arachnid</h1>
<p class="description">This dog-sized, spider-like robot has a plasma torch mounted on a stinger-like limb and gripping claws on its forelegs.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Explode-Ex-"></a>Explode (Ex)</h4>
<p>If an arachnid robot is destroyed or takes damage while below half its maximum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it must attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw with a DC equal to the amount of damage taken. If it fails, the robot explodes, dealing 2d4 points of plasma damage to all targets in a 10-foot-radius burst (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 10 half). Half the damage dealt by plasma is fire damage, and half is electricity damage. This destroys the robot if it was still animate. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Fragile-Ex-"></a>Fragile (Ex)</h4>
<p>When badly damaged, arachnid robots function poorly. An arachnid robot reduced to fewer than half its maximum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> and moves at half speed. Further damage may cause the robot to explode.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Plasma-Torch-Ex-"></a>Plasma Torch (Ex)</h4>
<p>An arachnid robot can use its arm-mounted plasma <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Torch">torch</a> in two ways. First, it can use the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Torch">torch</a> to make a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> against a target within 15 feet, dealing 1d6 points of plasma damage on a successful hit. Alternatively, the robot can emit a 15-foot cone from its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Torch">torch</a>, dealing 1d4 points of plasma damage to all targets in the area of effect (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 10 half). The robot’s plasma <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Torch">torch</a> requires 1 full round to recharge between uses. Half the damage dealt by plasma is fire damage, and half is electricity damage.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or colony (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Ubiquitous pets of technologists, arachnid robots also serve as sentinels and spies. Arachnid robots come equipped with a plasma welding torch that resembles a scorpion’s tail stinger and doubles as a weapon. Under stress, an arachnid robot’s plasma core can overload, destroying the robot in a fiery blast. This tendency inspired the practice of using the robots as suicide drones.</p>
<p>An arachnid robot is intelligent enough to have a sense of self-preservation, however, and one can be made to undertake such a mission only through trickery.</p>
<p>Despite their scorpion-like appearance, arachnid robots’ ability to use their claws as an additional pair of legs when climbing or moving quickly has earned the robots the name âspiderbotsâ.</p>

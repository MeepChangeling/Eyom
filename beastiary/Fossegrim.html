<h4><a name="TOC-Drowning-Touch-Su-"></a>Drowning Touch (Su)</h4>
<p>A fossegrim can flood the lungs of a creature that is willing, is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a>, is affected by its enchanted music ability, touches it while it’s in treasure form, or is touched by it (traditionally by kissing the creature on the lips). If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and immediately begins to drown slowly. On its turn, the target can attempt a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to cough up this water; if it fails, it falls <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> at 0 hp. On the next round, a fallen target must attempt another DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save, dropping to â1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a> if it fails; on the next round it must attempt to save again or lose 1d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. On the first successful save, the water clears from the target’s lungs and the target stabilizes. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Enchanting-Music-Su-"></a>Enchanting Music (Su)</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a fossegrim can play a musical stringed instrument (usually a harp or violin) and target a single creature within 45 feet that can hear and see the fossegrim with an effect identical to the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/u/unnatural-lust">unnatural lust</a> spell (CL 9th; <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 19). This action provokes an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. If the target touches or kisses the fossegrim, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> can affect the target with its drowning <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> ability. This is a sonic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Transparency-Su-"></a>Transparency (Su)</h4>
<p>When underwater, a fossegrim’s body becomes transparent, effectively rendering it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a>. It can become visible or transparent at will as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Treasure-Form-Su-"></a>Treasure Form (Su)</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> when completely underwater, a fossegrim can create an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> causing it to resemble a Medium pile of gold and silver coins, glittering jewels, and valuable art objects. If a fossegrim speaks, moves, attacks, or uses any of its special abilities or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> while in treasure form, the illusion dissipates. A successful DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save is required to disbelieve this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a>. If a living creature within the fossegrim’s melee reach touches or physically interacts with the illusion, the fossegrim reaches out to kiss or otherwise touch that creature, automatically affecting the creature with its drowning touch ability. The fossegrim can maintain this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> indefinitely and can revert to its normal natural form as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-lllusion-Glamer">glamer</a>) effect. The save DC to disbelieve is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold or temperate water (waterfalls)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (masterwork harp or violin, other treasure)</p>
<p>Pale and possessing unnatural beauty, fossegrims are wicked fey who haunt idyllic waterfalls, where they lure the unsuspecting near with song and the promise of treasure, only to drown them. Well built and elflike in appearance, fossegrims are gifted musicians, and their lairs often echo with the sound of bewitching music. They are never without their enchanting instruments.</p>

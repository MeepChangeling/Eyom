<h4><span id="Shadow_Blend_Su"><a name="TOC-Shadow-Blend-Su-"></a>Shadow Blend (Su)</span></h4>
<p>In conditions of illumination other than bright light, a shadow drake disappears into the shadows, giving it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> (20% miss chance). It can resume or suspend this ability as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Speed_Surge_Ex"><a name="TOC-Speed-Surge-Ex-"></a>Speed Surge (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, a shadow drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a> in that round.</p>
<h4><span id="Stygian_Breath_Su"><a name="TOC-Stygian-Breath-Su-"></a>Stygian Breath (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a shadow drake can exhale a ball of black liquid that explodes into a cloud of frigid black mist. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 2d6 points of cold damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 12 half) to all creatures within a 5-foot-radius spread. The mist snuffs out light sources in the area effect, extinguishing non-magical light sources and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/dispelling">dispelling</a> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/light">light</a> spells of 1st level or lower. Once a shadow drake has used its stygian breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or rampage (3â5)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Shadow drakes are mischievous and greedy. They often use their whiplike tails as third limbs, grasping small objects or even using their tails to work locks or swipe small objects they desire. Because they are so small and fast, they are master thieves and pickpockets. Unlike most drakes and dragonkin, shadow drakes like to haunt the fringes of civilization, often making lairs in abandoned buildings, forgotten attics, or unused bell towers, and stashing their tiny treasure hoards there. A shadow drake can be chosen as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-Bond-Ex-or-Sp-">familiar</a> by a 7th-level evil spellcaster who has the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/improved-familiar">Improved Familiar</a> feat. Young shadow drakes are almost pure black and have lustrous hides. As they age, their scales lose this luster and turn dull gray. Much like their larger <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a> cousins, shadow drakes are long-lived, and can reach 150 to 200 years in age.</p>

<p>A bladefish has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo---rage-powers/quick-reflexes-ex">quick reflexes</a> and powerful muscles along its length. It can make a full attack action with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> any time it could make single attack so long as it moves at least 5 feet before or after the attack. If a bladefish charges, both weapons gain the bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a> for charging. A bladefish does not have to attack the same creature with both weapons but must make both attacks at the same time. A bladefish takes no penalties to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a> for using <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/power-attack-combat">Power Attack</a> when it moves its full speed in a straight line.</p>
<h4><span id="Swim-By_Attack_Ex">Swim-By Attack (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A bladefish is perfectly suited for attacking on the move. It gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/spring-attack-combat">Spring Attack</a> as a bonus feat when swimming. It can use its razor fin ability to attack with both its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> before, during, or after a charge or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any ocean<br/><b>Organization</b> family (3-5), school (6-12), or storm (12-50)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Fast and strong, bladefish swim in instinctive circuits that cover thousands of miles. These cycles take them through their entire life cycle, including live birth, adolescence, hunting, and mating, Though beautiful to behold, bladefish are deadly carnivores and deliver brutal blows very rapidly as they charge in, swim past, and charge in again. Their skulls narrow to a flat, horizontal blade and their tail fins sport a similar vertical protrusion. Both bear shining scales along these sharp edges as decoration. A long, sharp mouth blade is ideal for hunting and defense, while the brightest sheen along its blades attracts the most desirable mates.</p>
<p>The greatest weapon bladefish have is in their numbers. Vast storms of them swim their lifelong circuits near the water’s surface and as deep as 200 feet. When one senses an intruder, it determines whether the threat is manageable or overwhelming and reacts by charging or fleeing, respectively. The entire community of bladefish joins in that reaction, swimming away as one or attacking in a rapid frenzy of sharp bills. Weaker bladefish are left behind or join the fight late and risk losing their meal to more aggressive members.</p>
<p>An adult bladefish is 7 feet long and weighs 600 pounds.</p>
<p>Larger, rarer species can reach 40 feet in length and live for over a hundred years.</p>

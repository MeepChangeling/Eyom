<h4><span id="Grave_Dependent_Su"><a name="TOC-Grave-Dependent-Su-"></a>Grave Dependent (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A kere is mystically bonded to a single gravestoneâtypically the most impressive or oldest in a graveyardâand must never stray more than 300 yards from it. A kere who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded grave immediately becomes visible and unable to use any of her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>. A kere who is out of range of her bonded grave for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> damage, and another 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> every day of separation that followsâeventually, this separation kills the kere. A kere can break this bond or forge a new bond with a new grave by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. If a kere is not bonded with a grave, she must either actively try to forge a new bond or attempt to return to the realm of death (where she takes no penalties from not being bonded).</p>
<h4><span id="Grave_Meld_Su"><a name="TOC-Grave-Meld-Su-"></a>Grave Meld (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A kere can meld with any gravestone or funerary sculpture, similarly to how the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/meld-into-stone">meld into stone</a> functions. She can remain melded with such a structure as long as she wishes.</p>
<h4><span id="Grave_Tell_Sp"><a name="TOC-Grave-Tell-Sp-"></a>Grave Tell (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>This ability functions as the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-tell">stone tell</a>, but only affects stone funerary structures, like gravestones, cemetery monuments, lych-gates, mausoleums, and similar constructions.</p>
<h4><span id="Infectious_Fear_Su"><a name="TOC-Infectious-Fear-Su-"></a>Infectious Fear (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature struck by a kereâs shroud must succeed at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a> for 2d4 rounds. Any creature that physically touches a creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a> by this effect must succeed at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save as well or also be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a> for 2d4 rounds (though the fear of the creature touched is not contagious). The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Shroud_Ex"><a name="TOC-Shroud-Ex-"></a>Shroud (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A kereâs shroud is an insubstantial thing that only a kere can touch. Creatures that come into contact with this shroud find it to be as insubstantial as mistâthough they often do feel the terror it inspires. A creature that is unaware of a kere and is struck by her shroud is not aware that a weapon has struck it. A kereâs shroud vaporizes upon its ownerâs death.</p>
<h4><span id="Spiritsense_Su"><a name="TOC-Spiritsense-Su-"></a>Spiritsense (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Psychopomp">psychopomp</a> notices, locates, and can distinguish between living and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures within 60 feet, just as if she possessed the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Spirit_Touch_Ex"><a name="TOC-Spirit-Touch-Ex-"></a>Spirit Touch (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Psychopomp">psychopomp’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a>, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ghost-touch">ghost touch</a> weapon special ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Veil_of_Tears_Su"><a name="TOC-Veil-of-Tears-Su-"></a>Veil of Tears (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any graveyard that hosts a kere is gloomier and more solemn. All exterior areas within such a graveyard are perpetually affected by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mind-fog">mind fog</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 20). Additionally, any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature that enters the area is also affected as per the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 20). Those who save against these effects are immune to the graveyardâs veil of tears for the next 24 hours. Those who fail are affected by these penalties for as long as they remain in the graveyard. A veil of tears can be raised or lowered by the resident kere as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. The veil disperses if a kere leaves the graveyard or is destroyed, and rises upon her return. The veil can also be dispelled for 1 day by casting <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a> or a similar spell upon the kereâs bonded gravestone. The spell effects are cast at the kereâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> (usually 11th). The saving throw DCs are based on the resident kereâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (graveyards or the realm of death)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard </p>
<p>Certain places are sacred, settings meant to remain free of the raucous sounds and defiling touch of the living. Graveyards number among some of the most obvious of such places, where stone guardians and the buried weight of the dead bear on visitors with undeniable gravity. But certain forces disregard the fundamental sanctity of such groundâmortal and deathless heretics who use such places to hunt, feed, or cloak fouler deeds. Yet not all cemeteries are unguarded, and the vaporous shadows and palpable dread of some burial grounds suggest not corruption, but the custody of an ominous otherworldly guardian.</p>
<p>Keres, like all psychopomps, are emissaries of the the necropolis that all mortals must traverse at the end of life. While most psychopomps concern themselves with the souls of the recently deceased, keres mind the resting places of the dead. Their stewardship derives not from any otherworldly care for the deteriorating dust left in the wake of mortal life, but rather from an interest in those who come seeking the dead where they lie. Such creatures often engage in perversions keres seek to oppose. To this end, keres take up lonely residences amid the tombs and monuments of graveyards, spreading an ominous air and giving rise to tales of hauntings and strange encounters to deter even the boldest intruders from trespassing upon the fields they tend.</p>
<p>Keres appear as pale, sickly women standing about 5 feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p>As otherworldly natives, keres have little direct impact on the world of the living, but the atmosphere they intentionally create is undeniable. To deter the living from treading upon the cemeteries they mind, keres employ tactics similar to those of mournful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghost">ghosts</a> and mythical beings from storytellersâ tales of spirits and haunts. Their presence fills the area they guard with a palpable dread, and they fill these cemeteries with baleful howling, somber illusions, and glimpses of their own ghastly forms. While they rarely create phantasmagoric images of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>âout of a loathing for such perverse creaturesâtheir unsettling displays of dangerous animals, lost children, whispering plants, shuddering gravestones, living statuary, pale doppelgangers, unnatural weather, and other eerie phenomena are typically more than enough to give a graveyard a haunted reputation.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-and-Society"></a>Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>More than once, a kere has been known to grow bored in her vigil and actively attempt to attract mortal visitants, but such attention-seeking psychopomps often find the added excitement isn’t worth the bother.</p>
<p>For all of the ambiance and grim reputations cultivated by keres, their primary objective upon the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> is to preemptively thwart the deeds of necromancers and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>. To this end they terrorize grave robbers, harry the work of dark cultists, and openly attack the unliving. Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> beings who enter or manifest in a cemetery under a kere’s care find the weight of eternity crushing down upon them, making the most common sorts easy prey for these sentinel psychopomps. In some cases, though, more powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> might find ways to undermine a kere’s defenses, or even drive her off. Such desperate keres have been known to grudgingly seek out aid, typically from the church of the dead or fringe-dwelling magic-users, in countering the taint of undeath.</p>

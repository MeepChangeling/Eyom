<h4><a name="TOC-Powerful-Stench-Ex-"></a>Powerful Stench (Ex)</h4>
<p>An enraged ghonhatine secretes a tarry, musk-like chemical. Any living, non-ghonhatine creature within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. A creature that saves is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> as long as it remains in the area, and can’t be affected again by the same ghonhatine’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Stench-Ex-">stench</a> for 24 hours.

<h4><a name="TOC-Regurgitate-Ex-"></a>Regurgitate (Ex)</h4>
<p>A ghonhatine can expel the contents of its stomach as a ranged attack with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon">splash weapon</a> that has a range increment of 20 feet. It deals 2d6 acid damage to the target and splashes all adjacent creatures. In addition to taking damage, a target directly hit by a ghonhatine’s regurgitation must make two DC 24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saves, the first to resist contracting filth fever, and the second to avoid being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1 minute. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> creature can end its nausea early by dousing itself in a gallon of water. All creatures adjacent to the target must make DC 24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saves to avoid being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1 minute. Once a ghonhatine uses this ability it can’t use it again until it feeds. The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

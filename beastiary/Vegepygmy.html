<p> Vegepygmys are created by a dangerous fungus known as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/mold-russet">russet mold</a>âcreatures slain by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/mold-russet">russet mold</a> serve as incubators for the mold’s spores, and a day later, the dead body bursts to release 1d6 fully grown vegepygmys. A vegepygmy has no real relation to the body from which it emerges, but the creature may yet retain a strange sort of reverence for its âbirth corpseâ and carry with it a grisly memento from the body, typically a few bones or teeth. Often, a vegepygmy uses such bones to craft a crude spear or some other weapon.</p>
<p> Vegepygmy tribes live in tightly knit communities and fiercely guard their patches of russet mold. Vegepygmies cannot speakâthey communicate via a crude language of rhythmic taps, beats, and clicks. Hunting parties echo these exchanges through the caves they travel. Vegepygmies stand 2 to 4 feet tall and weigh between 15 to 45 pounds.</p>

<h4><span id="Pipes_Su">Pipes (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A satyr can focus and empower his magic by playing haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot radius must make a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be affected by <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person">charm person</a></i>,<i> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear">fear</a></i>,<i> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep">sleep</a></i>, or <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a></i>, depending on what tune the satyr chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes’ effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the satyr’s other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> as normal. The satyr’s use of his pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spell-like abilities, and if separated from them he may continue to use his standard abilities. The pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 week of labor. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, band (3â6), or orgy (7â11)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (dagger, short bow plus 20 arrows, masterwork panpipes, other treasure)</p>
<p>Satyrs, known in some regions as fauns, are debauched and hedonistic creatures of the deepest, most primeval parts of the woods. They adore wine, music, and carnal delights, and are renowned as rakes and smooth-talkers, wooing unwary maidens and shepherd boys and leaving a trail of awkward explanations and unplanned pregnancies in their wakes.</p>
<p>Though their bodies are almost always those of attractive and well-built men, much of the satyrs’ talent for seduction lies in their talent for music. With the aid of his eponymous pipes, a satyr is capable of weaving a wide variety of melodic spells designed to enchant others and bring them in line with his capricious desires.</p>
<p>In addition to their constant frolicking, satyrs often act as guardians of the creatures in their forest homes, and any who manage to turn the satyr’s lust to wrath are likely to find themselves facing down dangerous animals surrounding the faun. Still, while satyrs tend to value their own amusement well above the rights of others, they bear no ill will toward those they seduce. Children born from such encounters are always full-blooded satyrs, and are generally spirited away by their riotous kin soon after birth.</p>

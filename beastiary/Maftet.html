<p>Because of its intense training wielding a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar">scimitar</a> in each hand, a maftet’s off-hand <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar">scimitar</a> is treated as a light weapon.</p>

A maftet can activate up to two of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>.

<p>Dwelling in crumbling ruins and lost cities, maftets are a race of winged feline <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>. Accomplished hunters and stalkers, maftets are highly skilled in fighting with dual scimitars.</p>
<p>At home in dry deserts and mountains, maftets prefer to lair in abandoned ruins, mysteriously drawn to such desolate places. They also make do with dens in cliff-side caves or mountaintop eyries, but only if no suitable abandoned edifices can be found.</p>
<p>When a young maftet comes of age, it receives its runic tattoos from a shaman, usually the eldest female in the pride. The art and magic of creating these tattoos has been passed down from mother to daughter for thousands of years, along with the race’s oral history and legends. Their origins now lost to history, these tattoos are always the same (with minor cosmetic variations between the sexes and between different prides) and always have the same effects. Under no circumstances are these tattoos ever given to non-maftets.</p>

<h1>Cinder Ghoul</h1>
<p class="description">This creature is a swirling, humanoid cloud of burning ash and charred body parts. A red glow of burning embers can be glimpsed floating within the mass. This creature reeks of smoke and burnt flesh.</p>

<p> The cinder ghouls are nearly mindless, and move to attack the closest targets. On the first round that a cinder ghoul is adjacent to a foe at the start of that round, the ghoul attempts its smoke inhalation attack while the other ghoul continues to fight. Although they will pursue foes who retreat a short distance, they will not follow them farther than a hundred feet. The cinder ghouls fight until destroyed.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Smoke-Inhalation-Su-"></a>Smoke Inhalation (Su)</h4>
<p> As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its smoky form into the lungs of an adjacent living opponent. The target must succeed on a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside the victimâs lungs burns the tissues and organs, dealing 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> each round for 1d4+2 rounds. The affected creature can attempt another <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save each round to cough out the burning residue and stop the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> damage. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Smoke-Form-Ex-"></a>Smoke Form (Ex)</h4>
<p>A cinder ghoulâs natural form is similar to a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form">gaseous form</a> spell, though it retains its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a>, all attacks, and can use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> abilities. It is able to fly naturally but is subject to the effects of wind (though it cannot be dispersed and takes no damage from wind). A cinder ghoul cannot enter water or other liquids and cannot pass through small holes or narrow openings.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, gang (2-5) or mob (6-11)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A creature burnt to death by magical fire may rise again as a fiery undead being called a cinder ghoul. The lairs of old red dragons my be haunted by many of these pathetic, angry spirits and many a wizard that has dispatched a foe with a well placed fireball has been found mysteriously charred to death many months after the deed.</p>
<p>Cinder ghouls are barely intelligent, but they do have a very vivid recollection of the pain they endured in the moments before their death. Filled with anger as fiery as the flames that that took their life, cinder ghouls harbor a strong hatred of fire and any living creature that has control over it.</p>
<p>Although it cannot speak, the sound of wailing and screaming and the rushing of fire-stoked wind constantly accompany a cinder ghoul.</p>

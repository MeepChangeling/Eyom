<p>A petrifern can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrify</a> itself as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> in order to defend itself from predators. When it does so, the petrifern’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a> to AC increases by 5, it gains resistance 10 to cold and fire, and it can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Take-20">take 20</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks to appear as a sprout or fallen tree branch. While <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrified</a>, the petrifern can’t move or take any actions. A petrifern can remain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrified</a> indefinitely, and it can cease its petrification as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Toxic_Secretion_Ex">Toxic Secretion (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Petriferns secrete a bitter toxin meant to make them distasteful to predators. Once per day when a creature touches a petrifern, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> can release its toxin, causing the attacker to become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1d4 rounds if it fails a DC 11 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any forest<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or bundle (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The petrifern is an unusual plant creature that resembles a small, humanoid-shaped fern. It is able to walk about on its roots. A petrifern has the unusual ability to petrify itself at will, hardening its branches and leaves to resemble those of a plant that has been fossilized by natural means. Its chemical makeup not only allows it to petrify itself but also doubles as a toxin that the plant can emit from its foliage when it senses danger.</p>
<p>Like all plants, petriferns subsist on oxygen, sunlight, and water. But unlike most flora, they can relocate themselves to ensure they always receive an abundance of nutrients. Once rooted, a petrifern typically petrifies itself until either the nearby soil is depleted of nutrients or external factors cause it to seek sustenance elsewhere.</p>
<p>Petriferns reach a maximum height of 1 foot and weigh up to 3 pounds.</p>

<h1>Herd Animal, Scythe Horn</h1>
<p class="description">This large stag-like creature stands the size of a large warhorse. A pair of jagged and terrible-looking antlers crown its brow. They look like they could slice a man in half.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Stampede-Ex-"></a>Stampede (Ex)</h4>
<p>A stampede occurs if three or more creatures with stampede make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Trample-Ex-">trample</a> attack while remaining adjacent to each other. While stampeding, the creatures can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Trample-Ex-">trample</a> foes of their size or smaller, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Trample-Ex-">trampleâs</a> save DC increases by +2. </p>

<p>Year-round grazers, scythe horns live in moderate to cold climates existing primarily on a diet of grasses, roots, and similar vegetation. Scythe horns are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/herd-animals">herd animals</a> and most often encountered within a herd. When traveling, scythe horns form a straight line, with the strongest male (or bull) at the front of the herd. Similarly, the next strongest bull takes its spot at the rear of the herd. Young are always kept in the middle with the females in front of and behind the calves. If the herd is attacked, the female scythe horns (cows) move to encircle the young, while the bulls move to confront the threat.</p>
<p>During winter months when ice and snow cover the ground, scythe horns generally congregate near water sources such as lakes or streams, where the ground may give easier access to the vegetation they need to survive. Also, during the winter months, scythe horns either obtain water from such streams or crush snow and ice between their flattened teeth.</p>
<p>The average scythe horn is 10 to 13 feet long, standing 5 to 6 feet tall at the shoulders, and weighs 2,000 to 2,500 pounds. Its body is covered in a thick brownish-black or brownish-gray fur, longer in the front around the neck than in the rear of the animal. Its legs are short and thick and its black hooves are circular in shape. Its most identifying features are its magnificent ebony colored horns which curve upward and inward in a scythe-like shape.</p>
<p>Scythe horns are often hunted by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> for their fur, hide (which can be crafted into hide armor), and meat.</p>
<p>Scythe horns are highly territorial and move to engage any creature that comes within their area. They are generally passive creatures but become highly aggressive if their young or the herd is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares">threatened</a>. An enraged scythe horn butts or slashes with its scythe-like horns. If startled, a herd generally flees, starting a stampede in the process.</p>
<p><b>Scimitar Horn</b> A relative of the scythe horn, the scimitar horn is found only in cold plains and hills. They use the same statistics for the scythe horn, but have no butt attack, and attack by slashing with their scimitar-like horns.</p>

<h1>Cinderghost</h1>
<p class="description">In the midst of a swirling cloud of desiccated ashes is the vague shape of a humanoid, with hollow, unblinking eyes that flicker like dying embers.</p>

<p>As long as a cinderghost is in an environment where ashes are plentiful (such as a non-urban area on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Fire">Plane of Fire</a>, or a burned-out settlement or field on another plane), it has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Fast_Healing_Ex">fast healing</a> 5. It loses this fast healing if it leaves such an area.</p>
<h4><span id="Desiccating_Touch_Su"><a name="TOC-Desiccating-Touch-Su-"></a>Desiccating Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As part of its incorporeal touch attack, a cinderghost draws the moisture from its opponentâs body, causing the victim to wither into ash. The target must succeed at a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> check or take 1d8 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any plains (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Fire">Plane of Fire</a>)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, trio, or rush (8â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Native denizens of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Fire">Plane of Fire</a> assiduously avoid the many vast ashen wastes. Those whose foes catch them in such places often beg or bribe their enemies to allow them to battle elsewhere, fearful of the terrible <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> that might lurk nearby and the terrible fate that awaits those who fall prey to them.</p>
<p>Called cinderghosts, these monsters arise from intelligent creatures that die in the cinderplains.</p>
<p>Cinderghosts largely keep the shapes and features they had in life, and therefore typically look vaguely humanoid, though they appear to be made of ashes with cracks through which sullen flame shows. They often trail long wakes of ashes behind them.</p>
<p>Cinderghostsâ touch can suck the moisture out of living creatures, turning them into twisted, mummified corpses that easily catch fire. The air around cinderghosts crackles with heat.</p>
<p>Though they rarely speak, cinderghosts seem to retain some intelligence, for they stalk living creatures with malice and determination. They wait until their prey can be caught asleep or unaware and consign their victims to the same fate they suffered.</p>

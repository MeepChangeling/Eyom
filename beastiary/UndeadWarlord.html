<h1>Undead Warlord</h1>
<p class="description">This creature appears to be a skeletal humanoid, wearing antiquated and exquisite <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, and wielding a powerful greatsword. His eye sockets glow with an unearthly light, and he moves with a supernatural grace and silence.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> When the warlord encounters a party, he looks them over, and decides which of the members would be the best match for him in honorable, single combat. Once decided, he offers the hero a challenge. He explains that the only way he can find peace is if a foe of the same approximate power defeats him in honorable combat. If the hero accepts his challenge and can defeat him, the warlord promises to reward him with great power and wealth. If the challenge is accepted, the duel begins. If the challenge is not accepted, the warlord immediately attacks the entire party in a fit of rage.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> If engaged in single combat, the undead warlord fights well and honorably, attacking with his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/greatsword">greatsword</a>. He uses his feats to his advantage, changing his swing with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-expertise-combat">Combat Expertise</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/power-attack-combat">Power Attack</a> to adjust to his opponentâs ability if necessary.</p>
<p>Anyone attempting to interfere in the duel is subject to the warlordâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Frightful-Presence-Ex-">frightful presence</a>. If the warlord brings his opponent to 0 or fewer <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, he stops fighting and wanders away, leaving the warrior in the hands of his party for ministrations, last rites, or whatever they can give. If not engaged in single combat, the warlord attacks the strongest warrior first, and works his way through the party to the weakest. He still uses all of his abilities to their best advantage.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> If the warlord is killed in a fair single combat, he turns to dust and fades permanently, leaving behind his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/greatsword">greatsword</a> and a number of magical items, gems, and platinum. If anyone helps during the duel, or if the hero defeats him dishonorably, the warlord turns to smoke and fades away upon being defeated, reforming in one dayâs time to again find a hero to end his misery.</p>

<p>During a duel, all those not involved with the fight are subject to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Frightful-Presence-Ex-">frightful presence</a> of the warlord if they attempt to interfere in any way. Intervening creatures with fewer <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> than the warlord must succeed on DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked">panicked</a> for 2d6 rounds. An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to that warlordâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Frightful-Presence-Ex-">frightful presence</a> for 24 hours.

<p>This creature is the spirit of a powerful ancient warlord, who long ago lost his life through an act of betrayal. He now wanders the world restless, looking to be bested in one final and fair fight, to once and for all lay his soul at peace. The undead warlord appears as a skeletal humanoid, wearing antiquated and exquisite <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, and wielding a powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/greatsword">greatsword</a>. His eye sockets glow with an unearthly light, and he moves with a supernatural grace and silence.</p>

<p>A warrior that uses trickery to defeat the warlord in single combat is not rewarded, and the warlordâs soul does not move on. Such trickery includes using magic items with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like</a> properties, being untruthful during combat, using <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack">sneak attacks</a> or dirty tricks, or being generally dishonorable. Entering combat under the effects of spells is also not honorable, although warriors with spellcasting powers (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin">paladins</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">rangers</a>) can use them during the battle without violating the undead warriorâs code.</p>
<h3><span id="Campaign"><a name="TOC-Campaign"></a>Campaign</span></h3>
<p>The undead warlord can be placed into nearly any campaign simply as a sidebar. He may appear in a partyâs path at any given point of time and issue his challenge. Be sure to adjust the level of the warlord to match the heroes. In general, a PC with more <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> than the warlord is not challenged.</p>
<p>It may be more interesting to hype up the encounter of the warlord, giving the heroes rumors of a powerful figure that haunts some location, challenging and defeating all warriors that come near, with the promise of some unknown power. Allow PCs who take the time to investigate the local history to hear or read the tale of the fallen warlord, making them sympathetic to his plight.</p>
<p>Depending on the event that reduced the warlord to this state, he may be used as the guardian of something more: perhaps a great weapon or the key to some powerful magic item or artifact. Defeating the warlord may open a rift into a minor pocket plane, allowing some great item to be revealed.</p>

<p class="description">This towering stone automaton bears the likeness of an archaic, armored warrior. It moves with ponderous but inexorable steps.</p>

<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A stone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transmute-rock-to-mud">transmute rock to mud</a> spell slows a stone golem (as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transmute-mud-to-rock">transmute mud to rock</a> heals all of its lost hit points.</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-to-flesh">stone to flesh</a> spell does not actually change the golem’s structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Slow_Su">Slow (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet in a burst centered on the golem and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to negate. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or gang (2â4)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A stone golem has a humanoid body made from stone, frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might look like it is wearing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, with a particular symbol carved on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of its limbs. Its head is often carved to resemble a helmet or the head of some beast. While it may be sculpted to carry a stone shield or stone weapon such as a sword, these aesthetic choices do not affect its combat abilities.</p>
<p>Like most golems, a stone golem cannot speak and makes no sound other than the grinding of stone against stone when it moves. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Construction">Construction</span></h3>
<p>A stone golem’s body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 3,000 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality, and costs 5,000 gp.</p>

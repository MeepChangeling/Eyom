<p>A chyzaedu’s zealous drive to consume infects the minds of those around it. Any living creature within 30 feet of a chyzaedu must succeed at a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or immediately consume any food and beverages (including <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions">potions</a> and the like) on its person or within its reach. This effect continues for as long as it takes the creature to consume all the food and beverages within its reach. The creature defends itself normally but takes no other actions while eating and drinking. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect.

<p>Chyzaedu resemble massive pale earthworms, save that each has a hard beaks at one end and a knot of short tentacles at the other. Their bodies are extremely flexible and ringed with powerful muscles. Chyzaedu have very efficient, well-developed digestive systems, allowing them to ingest a wide variety of materials, although they prefer to eat sentient creatures in order to share the religious experience of consumption.</p>
<p>Chyzaedu have a ring of tiny eyes around their beaklike maws, mostly hidden by the folds of their skin. These eyes are particularly keen and can dilate to allow the creature excellent night vision. Their eyes are supplemented by the lumpy and irregularly sized parietal eyes that line the area just behind their beaks; these serve as supplemental sensory organs, pinpointing the location of other nearby creatures in contact with the ground. The cloaca at the end of a chyzaedu’s body is ringed by five flexible, ridged tentacles, which can wind together to form a clawlike appendage. A chyzaedu has significant control over this appendage and can use it to grasp items, manipulate devices, or cast spells with somatic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a>.</p>
<p>Chyzaedu track and study <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magical-beasts/purple-worm">purple worms</a> and their variants (in particular, the colossal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magical-beasts/purple-worm/crimson-worm">crimson worms</a>). Some chyzaedu view <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magical-beasts/purple-worm">purple worms</a> as enlightened brutes, devoid of intellect but wholly overwhelmed by the religious fervor of consumption.</p>
<p>Other chyzaedu see <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magical-beasts/purple-worm">purple worms</a> as little more than breeding stock, but hope to use them to enhance future generations of their race.</p>
<p>Chyzaedu measure of 60 feet in length on average and weigh approximately 5,000 pounds.</p>

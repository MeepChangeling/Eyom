<h4><a name="TOC-Water-Dependency-Ex-"></a>Water Dependency (Ex)</h4>
<p>Monstrous crabs can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>. Beyond this limit, a monstrous crab runs the risk of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suffocation">suffocation</a>, as if it were drowning.</p>

<p>Monstrous crabs are omnivores and spend most of their time combing the ocean floors for food. Many act as vegetarians and sustain themselves on a diet of algae, fungus, and water-based plants, while others act as scavengers or predators. Some have been known to actively hunt giant clams and snails (the monstrous crab pries the shell open and devours the fleshy innards). Still others prefer to dwell in coastal waters and prey upon land-based creatures that wander too close to the shoreline. Monstrous crabs are often hunted as food by other races (particularly humans and sahuagin).</p>

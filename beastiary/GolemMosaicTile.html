<p><b>Before Combat</b> A mosaic tile golem tasked with guarding or securing a location flattens itself so as to go unnoticed to would-be trespassers.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> When an interloper treads upon the golem, it unfurls itself into its full form and attacks, crushing and pounding its unsuspecting victim.</p>

<h4><span id="Camouflage_Ex">Camouflage (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>While flattened, a mosaic tile golem is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding floor. It takes a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check to notice a flattened mosaic tile golem for what it is. Creatures with stonecunning receive their bonus to notice a flattened mosaic tile golem.</p>
<h4><span id="Energy_Absorption_Su">Energy Absorption (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any energy-based (acid, fire, cold, electricity, sonic) attack that directly targets a mosaic tile golem is absorbed into its body dealing no damage to the golem. A mosaic tile golem can either use the absorbed energy to repair itself, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage the attack would have otherwise dealt, or it can release the energy in a 30-foot cone that deals the same amount of energy damage it absorbed, up to a limit of 24 hp to all creatures within the area (DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> halves). The mosaic tile golem can store the energy for a number of rounds equal to half its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> (four rounds for the standard mosaic tile golem) before releasing it as a blast. The DC for this ability is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Flatten_Ex">Flatten (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, once per round a mosaic tile golem can flatten its form to become (or appear to become) a section of floor, road, or any other stone surface.</p>
<p>While flattened it cannot move or attack and its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> increases to 20/<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a>. A mosaic tile golem can reform into its chosen shape as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mosaic tile golem is immune to any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> that allows <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below: A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transmute-rock-to-mud">transmute rock to mud</a> spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transmute-mud-to-rock">transmute mud to rock</a> spell heals all its lost <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>; A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-to-flesh">stone to flesh</a> spell does not actually change the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> structure, but it negates the mosaic tile <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> for 1 round.</p>
<h4><span id="Stunning_Blow_Ex">Stunning Blow (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature hit by a mosaic tile golemâs slam attack must succeed on a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round.</p>
<p>The DC for this ability is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based and receives a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Mosaic tile golems are composed of various tile pieces, usually utilizing whatever tile is native to the region in which it is constructed, jointed and fitted together so as to allow the creature to fold itself flat. They are created to serve as guardians or servants by powerful spellcasters, the source of many an unsuspecting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogueâs</a> demise.</p>
<p>Though a mosaic tile golem cannot speak, when constructed, its creator can program up to 4 simple words or phrases (no more than 10 words in length) into it that cause it to behave in a certain fashion when certain conditions are met. These conditions are programmed into the golem when it is constructed. Conditions can be as general or specific as necessary, but must be fairly simple, such as âif anyone enters this roomâ or âif anyone touches this chestâ.</p>
<p>A mosaic tile golem stands 10 feet tall and weighs on average around 1,200 pounds. Many different forms have been seen in regards to bodily shapes, and the only limit to design is the artistic talent of the golemâs creator. Regardless of its physical shape, the golem shares the same abilities as all other mosaic tile golems, with only the amount of limbs and number of attacks there of ever changing.</p>

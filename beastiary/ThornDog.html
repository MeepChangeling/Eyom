<h1>Thorn Dog</h1>
<p class="description">These specially bred creatures appear as large dogs with thorny vines woven through their brown-black fur. Their teeth are like thorns and their eyes are the colors of flowers. During the spring, a âwreathâ of flowers sprouts out around their necks and down their spine.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Unless directed by a master, thorn dogs will spread out and try to position themselves to be able to attack.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Thorn dogs will try to pack attack those who are isolated from their allies and spellcasters first. Preferentially, they will concentrate on one target at a time, disabling them before moving on.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Thorn dogs are implacable foes, they will not flee combat unless it serves some tactical or strategic purpose. They are breed as warriors and they will fight to the death if needed.</p>

<h1>Stone Maiden</h1>
<p class="description">This creature resembles an exquisitely carved statue, female and shapely in design. Loose-fitting robes clothe her form and a veil hangs across her shoulders and wraps around her head, though her face is not obscured. Her skin is the color of shale. </p>

<p>Stone maidens are reclusive creatures of elemental earth thought to be somehow related to dryads and other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> creatures of earth and nature. How sages came to this conclusion is unknown (but one can venture a guess and say it is because like many fey creatures, such as nymphs, dryads, and nereids, the stone maiden is a strikingly attractive female creature). They spend almost of their time on the Elemental Planes of Earth, rarely venturing into the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, unless summoned. If summoned by a spellcaster, a stone maiden performs the task asked of her (if she can and if it does not go against her alignment) and quickly returns to her home plane.</p>
<p>Stone maidens rarely associate with other races, preferring to deal only with those of their own kind (meaning earth creatures). They are often found in the company of geons, non-evil vilstraks, and earth elementals. (It is rumored the Elemental Lord of Earth has a personal harem of stone maidens in his private palace.)</p>
<p>A stone maiden’s features are delicate and smooth. Her hair (almost always hidden by her veil) is long and flowing, and generally darker than her grayish “skin.” A typical stone maiden stands about 6 feet tall.</p>
<p>A stone maiden can be summoned using a <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster">summon monster</a> VII</i>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/planar-ally">planar ally</a> (or greater), or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/planar-binding">planar binding</a> (or greater) spell.</p>

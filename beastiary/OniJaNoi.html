<h1>Oni, Ja Noi</h1>
<p class="description">This hunchbacked, fiery-skinned humanoid possesses black eyes beneath the bony ridges of its brow, wears elaborate heavy <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, and wields an ornate metal club.</p>

<h4><span id="Serene_Fighter_Su"><a name="TOC-Serene-Fighter-Su-"></a>Serene Fighter (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A ja noi is extremely disciplined and maintains its focus even in the midst of combat. Once per day as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a>, a ja noi may reroll a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save.</p>

<p>A ja noi is an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> spirit that takes the form of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-hobgoblin">hobgoblin</a>, and differs physically from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/hobgoblin">hobgoblins</a> in a variety of ways, most notably its unearthly strength and distorted appearance. A ja noi’s skin blazes a fiery red rather than a drab gray, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> bears prominent ridges on its brow and forehead.</p>
<p>Ja noi live to fight. While not as physically powerful as most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a>, ja noi nonetheless have an insatiable thirst for combat that drives them to pursue the trials of battle and bloodshed. The sensation of hot blood splattering on a ja noi’s skin provokes an adrenaline rush that only fuels its lust for the kill. Its broad, tightly muscled physique and prowess in combat inspire awe within typical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/hobgoblin">hobgoblins</a>, who see the ja noi as a leader who ensures victory in their conquests.</p>
<p>Towering over the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/hobgoblin">hobgoblins</a> it resembles, a ja noi stands a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 220 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology7"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p>All <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> believe the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>‘s inhabitants fail to take advantage of the wealth of sensations they have at their disposal. While most of these evil spirits inhabit shells and rise to power by working behind the scenesâ manipulating others into doing most of their foul deeds for themâja noi take a more direct approach, conquering and slaughtering any who would stand against them and their armies. Ja noi embrace the carnal joys of slaughter, and no situation is more pleasant to a ja noi than the heat of combat upon a war-ravaged battlefield. These hardened <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> often recognize the inevitable outcome of their warlike tendencies, knowing that death could always be just around the corner; this knowledge, however, only further stimulates their greed for sensation, inspiring them to embrace every fight, as they know it could be their last. A ja noi silences its mind and ignores everything else while on the battlefield, reveling in the current moment and the sensations of combat: the crunch of bones beneath a worn <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/club">club</a>, the spray of dying foes’ blood, and the scattered guts and heads of fallen brawlers.</p>
<p>Like other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a>, ja noi possess the ability to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Change-Shape-Su-">change shape</a>, and often use this ability to confuse enemies in the midst of battle, altering their appearances to look like allies, only to bash in an unsuspecting foe’s head before the victim knows what’s happened. This brutish trickery is usually the extent of a ja noi’s guile, however, as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-hobgoblin">hobgoblin</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> are hardly known for their cunning. Even in regard to tactics, ja noi usually implement only the basest plans of action, simply relying on their weaker minions to take the brunt of an opposing army’s blow while they target the commanders, always seeking the most worthy challenger and forever striving for that feeling that comes just as one is fighting for one’s life. The most powerful ja noi are exceptions to this rule, however, and tales tell of expert ja noi leaders who excel in both physical prowess and tactical wit. These commanders quickly reach the status of generals, and work alongside other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> to manipulate vast armies of soldiers, both <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Goblinoid">goblinoid</a>.</p>
<p>Once they take physical form, ja noi rarely last more than a couple years on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, their deadly lifestyle often a limiting factor in this regard. They either die in battle or at the hands of mutinous troops or allies, minions who realize that they are merely pawns in the game of war that the ja noi is constantly playing. Thus, most of these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> practice their battle skills constantly against one another, their strongest <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-hobgoblin">hobgoblin</a> followers, and their adroit adversaries, always fighting and becoming more powerful. While they care little for the arcane, ja noi hone some magical abilities in order to inflict maximum damage on the battlefield, and a few even seek out magical items to bolster their strength.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society8"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Ja noi are seen as lowly and primal by other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a>, but they possess immense amounts of authority among the lesser <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/hobgoblin">hobgoblins</a> around them, and so they surround themselves with these minions, viewing them as useful fodder for the battles to come. During the fight, a ja noi’s amateur hobgoblin warriors combat the masses of the opposing army, allowing the prideful oni to engage the commanders. Having found what they consider an ideal militaristic race, ja noi prefer to use hobgoblins for their war campaigns if possible, though they settle for other soldiers if doing so clearly benefits the oni and they have the mortals’ unquestioning loyalty. More often, a ja noi will employ non-hobgoblin minions to serve as slaves or some other form of chattel, putting them to work crafting armor and weapons or cleaning up during the aftermath of a successful battle.</p>
<p>In extremely rare cases, when they have no campaigns to wage and no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> enemies to battle, ja noi simply disappear into the wilderness to fight the mightiest creatures they can find. Laying waste to big game such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magical-beasts/bulette">bulettes</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magical-beasts/owlbear">owlbears</a> can distract a ja noi between large-scale battles, but it doesn’t take long before the natural warrior quickly feels the lust for battle surge within it once again. Given too much time between skirmishes, a ja noi might turn its violent attention toward its followers, slaughtering entire <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-hobgoblin">hobgoblin</a> tribes out of frustration and madness. Canny <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/hobgoblin">hobgoblins</a> in service to a bloodthirsty ja noi are wise to find opposing groups for the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-oni">oni</a> to battle, that the resulting conflict might temporarily sate the ja noi’s incessant desire for war.</p>

<p>Tri-flower fronds are carnivorous plants found in warm (and rarely temperate) forests. They are immobile creatures that reproduce by releasing seeds into the air and allowing either the wind (or creatures who happen to come into contact with them) to carry them wherever they go.  Seeds take root once they touch the ground, and within a few months, a new tri-flower frond appears.</p>
<p>A tri-flower frond stands about 5 to 8 feet tall. While the orange, red, and yellow flower combination is the most common, other color combinations have been reported, including white, gray, and pearly silver-gray, and golden brown, deep brown and russet.</p>

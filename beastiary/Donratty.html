<h4>Taste of the Forbidden (Su)</h4>
<p>Every time a donratty makes a successful bite attack on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>, the creature hit must succeed on a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to avoid being consumed by cannibalistic thoughts. On a failed save, the subject attacks the nearest <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> with a bite attack on its next turn. If there is no valid target to attack, the creature can take no actions, but is not considered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a>. A Medium <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoidâs</a> bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 for Small creatures and 1d8 for Large creatures). While under the influence of this effect, the subject is considered to be proficient with natural weapons. The effect lasts for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature who successfully saves is not subject to the same donrattyâs taste of the forbidden for 24 hours. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any cold<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair or company (3â15)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Grotesquely crooked, rotting, and oversized teeth protrude from the mouth of a haggard, humanoid figure with leathery skin and tattered clothing. Its sunken eyes emit a faint, yellowy glow and its fingers end in wicked claws.</p>
<p>The poles can offer a temporary refuge and a daunting challenge for people seeking to escape their present circumstances. Fugitives and criminals disappear into the bleak, lightless wasteland hoping to elude their pursuers and defy justice. While they may offer temporary sanctuary, the frozen forests and deserts are an unpredictable and cruel host for travelers. A sunny day can turn into a raging blizzard in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>The driving winds, bitter cold, and blinding precipitation can last for days and leave several feet of snow in its wake. People caught in the eye of the maelstrom face an agonizing decision â perish or do whatever it takes to survive regardless of the consequences. Those opting for the latter may ultimately live through the nightmarish experience albeit at a terrible price. Whether they chose to slay the least fit to preserve the groupâs dwindling resources or butcher other humanoids to devour their flesh and sate their hunger, the gods never forget the personâs unspeakable actions. When they die, the offended deities transform the transgressor into a donratty, a ghastly, undead monstrosity cursed to haunt the frigid terrain where it committed its grievous sins for the remainder of its wretched existence.</p>
<p>The monsterâs teeth immediately decay and grow to a disproportionate length, causing extensive crowding within its mouth. Its body shrivels into a wiry frame wrapped with leathery, light brown skin. Its fingernails morph into jagged claws and its eyes emit a dull, yellowy glow. Other than the preceding modifications, the donrattyâs facial features are still recognizable by those who knew it during its mortal life. The creature also wears the same tattered rags it wore when it assumed its new existence as a donratty.</p>

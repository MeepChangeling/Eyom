<h1>Whirlmaw</h1>
<p class="description">This creature glides on undulating folds of leathery skin. Its spinning, circular mouth is lined with rows of razor-sharp teeth.</p>

<h4 style="border-top:1px solid;border-bottom:1px solid"><a name="TOC-SPECIAL-ABILITIES3"></a>SPECIAL ABILITIES</h4>
<h4><a name="TOC-Burrowing-Bite-Ex-"></a>Burrowing Bite (Ex)</h4>
<p>If a whirlmaw successful hits a Small or larger creature with its bite attack, it immediately attempts to start a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> with a +4 bonus on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check is successful, the whirlmaw’s spinning, saw-like mouth immediately begins to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> into the flesh of the creature, dealing 4d6+12 points of damage per round until the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> is broken.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Dust-Cloud-Ex-"></a>Dust Cloud (Ex)</h4>
<p>By rapidly beating the leathery flaps of skin attached along its body, a whirlmaw can raise a cloud of debris while using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/hover">Hover</a> feat just as if it were a Large creature.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Flying-Charge-Ex-"></a>Flying Charge (Ex)</h4>
<p>When a whirlmaw makes a charge attack while flying, it gains a +4 bonus on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a> (rather than the normal +2 bonus), and does not take the normal â2 penalty to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class">Armor Class</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Keen-Sight-Ex-"></a>Keen Sight (Ex)</h4>
<p>A whirlmaw is extremely sharp-sighted. It takes only half the penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks for distance, and can see creatures in open terrain clearly from up to a mile away.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm deserts<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or flight (2â9)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none (eye gems worth 300 gp each)</p>
<p> Little more than flying eaters, these creatures rise singly or in flights, and attack all other living creatures that enter their territory. They are equally at home nestled in shallow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>s beneath sand dunes or resting in the rocky crevices of mountains. When they hunt, they soar upon the high thermals and keep an eye out for potential prey through the stony orbs that serve as their eyes.</p>
<p>These bizarre hunters prefer to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a> into the torsos of their victims and consume the blood-rich organs, leaving the corpses’ peripheral parts for scavengers. Few that encounter these vicious predators live to tell of it. The skeletal remains of whirlmaws’ victims can be identified by the suspiciously circular sections of their torsos missing where the creatures burrowed through and consumed the flesh, bone, and organs in their entirety.</p>
<p>The green, gem-like eyes of a whirlmaw are prized by those who seek exotic and dangerous treasures in the desert. It is speculated by some that these mystical orbs are the source of the whirlmaw’s natural fire <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">alchemists</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a> often use them as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a> in creating magic items that bestow that form of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance">energy resistance</a>.</p>

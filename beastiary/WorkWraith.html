<h4>Fatiguing Aura (Su)</h4>
<p>The work wraith is surrounded by a misty aura that saps strength. All creatures who end their turn in this aura must succeed at a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued">fatigued</a>. Fatigued creatures become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted">exhausted</a> instead, and exhausted creatures become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> on a failed save.</p>
<p>This effect persists as long as the creature remains within range and for one minute afterward.</p>
<p>A creature can attempt a new save at the end of its turn to end the effect once out of the aura.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any urban<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair or in groups of 1d4+1<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Work wraiths are the unquiet ghosts of child laborers who died in a factory or heavy, forced labor situation. Exhausted, starving and hopeless in life, in undeath work wraiths seek to inflict a small portion of their own suffering on the overseers, bosses and taskmasters.</p>
<p>Like all undead, work wraiths both hate life and covet it, but they have little interest in torturing ordinary working folk. Living workers unfortunate enough to toil in a factory they are haunting are tortured with fear, with poltergeist pranks and workplace accidents that might take limbs, but rarely life. Their true murderous fury is reserved for the rich bastards who own the factories and the sweatshops, and the middle-rank cowards who work their fellow peasants into the grave for a taste of money.</p>
<p>Work wraiths are the ghostly spirits of poor children, dressed in drab, ragged shifts. Their spiritual forms bear the bloody wounds that killed them forever â they are often missing arms or legs that were devoured by the crushing gears. The blood that a work wraith drips is tangible and real, even if nothing else about the monster is.</p>
<p>They retain much of their living personality and memories, but their spirits are twisted with rage and cruelty â they are childlike sadists.</p>

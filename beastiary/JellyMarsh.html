<p>When slain, a marsh jelly explodes in a blast of acid that deals 2d6 points of acid damage to anything within 10 feet. A successful DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save reduces the damage by half.

<p>When a marsh jelly first takes damage, its body begins pulsating and flashing rapidly, emitting an eerie greenish glow. Creatures viewing a pulsating marsh jelly must succeed on a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled">dazzled</a> for 1d4 rounds.

<p>This bizarre creature floats slowly through the gloom of swamps and marshes. It has a gelatinous body reminiscent of a jellyfish that is nearly translucent, its four stringy tentacles dangling beneath it in a constant hunt for food. Marsh jellies are roughly man-sized and tend to thrive on giant swamp rats, and other creatures smaller than itself. It is not uncommon however for a marsh jelly or a globe of such creatures to prey on unwary travelers who stray to deeply into open marshland. Marsh jellies are responsible for the strange disappearance of many who enter their swamps for they digest their prey, bones and all, leaving only acidresistant precious metals such as gold behind.</p>
<p>A marsh jelly looks like a hovering, flying jellyfish with a translucent sickly green body and four long dangling grayish-pink tentacles. Many smaller tentacles ring its body and aid the creature in locomotion as well as detecting scents in the air. A marsh jelly’s body emits a pulsating glow when it is threatened or damaged, and the creature can likewise use this glow to lure prey closer to it.</p>
<p>Marsh jellies descend on their prey from above, stinging repeatedly with their venomous tentacles. When wounded, their translucent flesh begins to pulse rapidly with a flashing green strobe effect that tends to disorient its prey, and any other creatures who may seek to harm it.</p>

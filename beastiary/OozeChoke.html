<h1>Ooze, Choke</h1>
<p class="description">This steaming mass of ooze churns and writhes in a pale tidal mass of anger and hunger. Great chunks of ooze boil upwards and splash back into its horrific bulk.</p>

<h4><span id="Air_Production_Ex">Air Production (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a natural byproduct of its metabolism, a choke ooze constantly discharges breathable air into its surroundings. This provides breathable air within 30 feet of a choke ooze even in a vacuum and diminishes the effectiveness of gases and clouds within 30 feet. Creatures within 30 feet of a choke ooze gain a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on saving throws against gaseous effects and on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> checks to dispel magical gases, mist, and vapor, and the duration of such effects is reduced by 50% within 30 feet of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Envelop_Ex">Envelop (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, a choke ooze can envelop an opponent that it has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a>. This ability functions similarly to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-">swallow whole</a>, though swallowed creatures can breathe without difficulty inside a choke ooze due to the breathable atmosphere its inner substance discharges. A choke ooze can envelop up to 1 Gargantuan, 2 Huge, 4 Large, 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/medium">Medium</a>, 32 Small, 64 Tiny, 128 Diminutive and 512 Fine creatures.</p>
<h4><span id="Seething_Skin_Ex">Seething Skin (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature touching a choke ooze’s seething membrane of roiling acid, including striking the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapon</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a>, or melee <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, takes 2d6 points of acid damage. Manufactured weapons that strike a choke ooze take this damage as well, and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> of metal weapons is halved against the choke ooze’s acid.</p>

<p>Usually these creatures are found in two ways-cultivated or wild. The latter is rare in the extreme for reasons outlined below. Cultivated choke oozes are usually massive-to enable them to yield the maximum amount of harvest. Sometimes smaller versions of these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> are found cultivated-often where a portable form of air is required in remote locations.</p>
<p>It’s rumored that the first true choke oozes were distilled and filleted by the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/aboleth">aboleth</a>, used to create vast sub-oceanic domes of air for visitors and air-breathing slaves. Another conjecture has the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a> or their allies fleshwarping them into existence. Whatever caused their creation, there seems little doubt that choke oozes were conceived, not discovered. Their fundamental purpose-and the reason for their being found in such vast quantities when they are met-is their ability to convert sustenance into breathable air. This boon not only causes their profligacy, but also may explain why they are so rarely encountered in the wild or randomly met. So great is this boon that the choke ooze is greatly prized, and even an immature specimen may fetch a king’s ransom amongst those with a vested interest in bringing air to remote locations.</p>
<p>There are, of course, dangers with the ooze. The first is its hunger-a choke ooze is never sated, its hunger a constant gnawing ache that is never satisfied. This need makes securing the ooze of the greatest importance, since they are drawn to flesh-any flesh-to consume. Unless held within an appropriately tough-usually steel or iron- container, their ability to create air is soon lost. Second is their need to be fed-in general 1 hit dice of food enables 1 Large choke ooze create enough air to fill a chamber one-hundred yards square for a day-this is a wild generalization, however, as the quality and quantity of air created varies from ooze to ooze-something some keepers extoll as a considerable virtue.</p>

<h1>Hanged Man</h1>
<p class="description">This creature has pale skin pulled tight over its bones. Its head hangs at an odd angle, seemingly unsupported by a broken neck. A rotted noose and several feet of rope hang from its neck and trail off behind it. Its eyes have no pupils.</p>

<p>A hanged man is the restless corpse of an evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid" target="_blank">humanoid</a> that was hanged or the spirit of one wrongfully accused of a crime and hanged. It is a malevolent and vengeful creature that attacks living creatures on sight.</p>
<p>Hanged men are usually encountered near the area where they were killed or in cemeteries, mausoleums, or graveyards where their body was laid to rest. They prey on the living and are found near civilized areas where their food supply is plentiful. Its lair is either its final resting place or a secluded and overgrown area near the place of its death. Its lair is always scattered with the remains of its victims, including any treasure a former meal happened to be carrying.</p>
<p>A hanged man attacks primarily with its rope, which has become imbued with negative energy and now acts as an extension of the hanged man itself. It uses its rope to capture victims and draw them in where it rips and tears them to shreds with its filthy claws.</p>

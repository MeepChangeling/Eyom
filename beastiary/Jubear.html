<p>Jubears have the resistance of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>. They have good <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> and Reflex saves while having poor Will saves.</p>
<h4><span id="Digestive_Ooze_Ex"><a name="TOC-Digestive-Ooze-Ex-"></a>Digestive Ooze (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An opponent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> by the jubear takes 1d6 points of acid damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Swallow_Whole_Ex"><a name="TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-"></a>Swallow Whole (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> for three consecutive rounds is swallowed whole. A swallowed opponent takes 3d6 points of acid damage each round. A swallowed creature can escape by doing 9 points of damage to the inside of the bear with a light slashing or piercing weapon (AC 15). A creature that escapes the pin while swallowed whole emerges from the bearâs stomach, not its throat, where it may be grabbed and pinned again.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold and temperate forests<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>The jubear is a species of brown bear that has formed a symbiotic relationship with a rare form of green slime. Instead of dissolving the bearâs flesh, the ooze feeds off the bearâs stomach, in turn granting the bear immunity to acid, the ability to digest almost anything, and the ability to regenerate. The jubear does not eat using its mouth, though it can still attack with its bite. Instead, it pushes prey into its body where the unfortunate creature is slowly dissolved if it does not escape.</p>
<p>A jubearâs skin oozes slime and mucous. Sickly white growths bulge from where its fur has not fallen away. The appearance of a jubear makes it seem the creature is diseased. Only a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature) or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (dungeoneering) check reveals otherwise. Since jubears possess no natural enemies, they quickly overwhelm any environment they enter. A scouring forest fire is often the easiest and quickest way to eliminate jubears, although that solution poses problems of its own.</p>

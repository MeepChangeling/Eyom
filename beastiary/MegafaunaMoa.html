<p>Moas are large, flightless birds that, with their necks outstretched, stand nearly as tall as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ogre">ogres</a>. They roam the grasslands feeding on the thick grasses and shrubs that are mostly inedible to smaller birds and mammals. While these birds are gigantic, they are rather docile and skittish, preferring to flee than fight.</p>
<p>They can become aggressive when faced with predators or perceived threats to their young or food sources. In these cases, the larger birds of a colony or group move forward to protect the young and weak moas of the flock.</p>
<p>These larger moas leap into the air and lash out with both of their broad, sharp talons to inflict grievous wounds.</p>
<p>A full-grown moa can weigh as much as 500 lbs.</p>

<p class="description">Though soiled with dirt and grit, these handservants have exceptional cheekbones, alluring eyes, and fine physiques. They each smile beautiful grins, beckoning you to come closer.</p>

<h4><span id="Curse_Su">Curse (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Zombie handservant can spread their malevolence to their enemies. As a full-round action a zombie handservant can curse its limbs for four rounds; the creature it hits with its cursed limb (using its slam attack) expends that use and makes a DC 12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or becomes unable to trespass in any ruins of the Ancestor People of the Vikmordere Valley. Cursed creatures that do so take 1d6+1 damage every 10 minutes they spend there. This curse may only be cured by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse">remove curse</a> (CL 10th).</p>
<h4><span id="Permanent_Illusion_Su">Permanent Illusion (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Zombie handservants appear as the beautiful people they were in life (as per a constant <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/major-image">major image</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>, but only affecting the zombie handservant).</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Klavek Kingdom)<br/><b>Organization</b> any<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Zombie handservants tended to great lords and kings of the Ancestor People, the ancient forefathers of the Vikmordere, and in death they continue to serve their masters in tombs and burial shrines throughout the Vikmordere Valley. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> ability gives them the appearance of the beautiful servants they were in life, granting these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> a powerful curse to bestow on trespassers to banish would be grave robbers from royal crypts. Zombie handservants do not talk, although they sound as if they are murmuring âsweet nothings,â appearing to move very fluidly (as they did in life).</p>
<p>Zombie handservants are created through the use of an <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead">animate dead</a> spell combined with various ceremonial rituals at the time of a lord or kingâs death. These culminating forces combine with the servantâs undying affection and will to serve their master, creating a zombie handservant.</p>
<p>Zombie handservants are bound to a particular king or lord and do not leave the tomb in which they are buried unless their corpse is removed. When this is the case the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature pursues the grave robbers responsible for all eternity, drawn magically toward their masterâs corpse regardless of where it is taken.</p>

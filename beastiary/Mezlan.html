<h4><span id="Morphic_Body_Su">Morphic Body (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a mezlan can assume the appearance of any Medium or Small creature (other than creatures with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Elemental">elemental</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> subtypeâthe body assumed must be solid). This ability affects only the mezlanâs outward image. Its creature type doesnât change in this new form; it gains none of the mimicked creatureâs special abilities, and it retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as depicted above. This is a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph">polymorph</a> effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Morphic_Weapons_Su">Morphic Weapons (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A mezlan can manipulate its body to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/mimic">mimic</a> a wide array of potent weaponry wielded by its various forms. While the weapons may look different, they are considered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> and they all do the same amount of damage. Morphic weapons deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>. Once per round, a mezlan can extend one of its limbs to strike at a distance up to 15 feet away with one of its morphic weapons. A mezlan can also attack with a morphic weapon by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo---rage-powers/hurling-ex">hurling</a> a portion of its body as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 60 feet (the mezlan swiftly regrows thrown portions of its body after using this attack, while the hurled portion melts away into slime after dealing damage to a target).</p>
<h4><span id="Skill_Pool_Ex">Skill Pool (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mezlan has a special knack for solving problems.</p>
<p>Five times per day, it can apply a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Competence-Bonus">competence bonus</a> to any skill check, even checks for skills it has no ranks in and skills that can only be used trained. A mezlan can use any skill, even those that would normally require it to be trained.</p>
<h4><span id="Store_Spells_Su">Store Spells (Su)</span></h4>
<h4><span id="Versatile_Speech_Ex">Versatile Speech (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A mezlan has a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Rogue-Talents">talent</a> for parsing spoken languages. After spending 1 minute listening to a speaker use a language it doesnât already know, a mezlan can understand that language. After listening for 1 additional minute, the mezlan can speak the language. This understanding lasts for 24 hours before fading from the mezlanâs mutable mind.</p>
<p>To understand the same language again after this time, the mezlan must spend another minute listening to a creature speak that language. The mezlan doesnât have to be engaged in a conversation to use this ability.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Built by ancient <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist">arcanists</a> and engineers to serve as spies and elite troops, units of mezlans were deployed to engage in extractions, infiltrations, and quick strikes on well-protected locations. Scholars believe that at the height of those ancient civilizations, close to 1,500 mezlans were created. The difficulty of destroying mezlans leads scholars to believe that at least half of them still exist to this day.</p>
<p>Mezlans <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blur">blur</a> the lines between <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a>, a mixture made even more strange by the fact that they have unique, previously <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a> personalities. Each mezlan was once an exemplary living soldier graced with superior skills and intelligence. Upon being chosen for this new duty, these soldiers were given a full explanation of the changes they would undergo and signed a contract agreeing to serve as mezlans. Each was then subjected to numerous magical and technological procedures to extract her consciousness, preserve it, and inject it into her new form. Sometimes the process didnât take, resulting in an incomplete and flawed mezlan. Indications of these flaws didnât always reveal themselves before the creatures were deployed, and many such mezlans abandoned their missions to pursue their own mysterious agendas.</p>
<p>Most mezlans were recruited from the ranks of the military, and thus most of them had martial-related or skill-related class levels; however, a few of these creatures were once <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a> who traded their magical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Rogue-Talents">talent</a> for an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Amorphous-Ex-">amorphous</a> form and near immortality.</p>
<p>Without the need to eat, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep">sleep</a>, or breathe, mezlans are practically immortal. When they are defeated in battle, they simply discorporate and begin seeping down into the soil or cracks in the ground. If the material making up a mezlan isnât contained in some way or destroyed by subjecting it to continued energy damage, the creature lies dormant for 10 years before reforming. When a mezlan reincorporates, it is treated as if it had 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a>. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative levels</a> are removed at a rate of 1 per month.</p>
<p>One notable exception is a mezlanâs morphic weapons.</p>
<p>While these attacks are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapons</a> and a mezlan thus cannot gain iterative attacks, a mezlan who has feats or class abilities that bolster specific weapons can apply the effects of those feats or abilities to its morphic weapons, provided the weapons are of the right shape. For example, a mezlan with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus/">Weapon Focus</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a>) would gain a +1 bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a> with its morphic weapon attacks when they are in the shape of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a>. This limits the damage type dealt by the morphic weapon to a damage type appropriate to the weapon being duplicated.</p>
<p>From all appearances, mezlans seem to get along well with each other; however, to normal, living creatures, they often appear strange and unnatural in both form and behavior.</p>
<p>They are very observant creatures that study everything they encounter, especially <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>âa frequent use of their skill pool ability. Some mezlans become accustomed to a particular form or body and use it as a default. Others keep dozens of regular guises and take on the ones most appropriate for particular duties they need to complete, using appearances and personalities as tools throughout their day-to-day activities. A few purists keep an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Amorphous-Ex-">amorphous</a>, bloblike form unless they need to resemble something else. Strange mezlans who have gone mad over the years constantly shift their forms, flickering between hundreds of different shapes.</p>
<h3><span id="Becoming_A_Mezlan">Becoming A Mezlan</span></h3>
<p>Though not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, mezlans are still created beingsâeach is a marriage of <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/transformative">transformative</a> magic and a living soul. Only the prohibitive cost of creating mezlans, rather than any shortage of volunteers, prevented their creators from manufacturing thousands more of them. The sheer volume of rare metals needed to create a mezlan forced their creators to grant the honor of the transformation to only the best of the best, greatly increasing their worth.</p>
<p>The complex and expensive method for creating a mezlan has long been lost, but rumors hold that one of them retains the knowledge to produce more of its kind. Other tales suggest that the ritual of creation survives to this day in a long-lost repository of ancient knowledge hidden deep under the ocean.</p>

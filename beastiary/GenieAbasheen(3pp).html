<p>Abasheens are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/genie">genies</a> from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Air">Plane of Air</a> and serve the nobles of that plane as diplomats, couriers, and emissaries. Some of the less scrupulous serve as spies and insurgents. They are extremely clever and often let their arrogance interfere with their assignments. Abasheen look down on all creatures from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>.</p>
<p>Abasheens and common djinn tolerate each other, but that is as far as it goes. They rarely work together and when they do, such pairings often degenerate into quarrels. The society structure of the abasheen is unknown but it is believed to be vastly different than that of the other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/genie">genies</a>. No abasheen nobles are known to exist and the entire race seems to be servitor to the race of djinn.</p>
<p>An abasheen stands about 8 feet tall and is always dressed in flowing robes colored to denote their current station. Their skin is dark and their build powerful. All have dark hair, either black or brown, and most wear their hair braided or pulled into a ponytail, tied with ribbons of gold or silver.</p>
<p>Abasheens rely on their physical attack and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> in combat. When combat starts, an abasheen commands one of its opponents (usually the one closest to it) to drop or flee (see the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/command">command</a> spell). On its next action it either bashes an opponent with its fists (if one is close enough) or attempts to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Charm">charm</a> an enemy spellcaster.</p>
<p>During combat, an abasheen rarely touches the ground, preferring to remain airborne and above its opponents. They rarely fight to the death. Should combat turn against an abasheen it always attempts to escape, usually by plane shifting away.</p>

<p>Lythics are creatures from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elemental-Planes">Elemental Planes</a> of Earth. There, they spend their time in huge underground caverns with others of their race or in the company of earth elementals. Some lythics serve the elder elemental lords as spies, using their skills of going unnoticed to sneak into the palaces of arch-rivals.</p>
<p>Lythics occasionally punch through a vortex or portal and wind up on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>. Other outer planes (save some of the more desolate Abyssal planes) hold no interest for the lythic. On the Material Plane, they spend their time underground or gliding through mountains, devouring minerals as they move along. Occasionally, a lythicâ€™s elemental master sends it on a mission into the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>.</p>
<p>Lythics are not particularly fond of pechs and generally avoid them or attack on sight. They rarely associate with other elemental creatures.</p>
<p>Lythic are not particularly hostile unless threatened. When a party of would-be delvers enters its domain, the lythic often trails them by blending with surrounding stone. If detected, a lythic usually flees unless attacked. Once in combat however, a lythic rarely backs down, and often fights until it is killed or its opponents are dead or fleeing.</p>

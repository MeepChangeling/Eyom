<h1>Pepfralcon</h1>
<p class="title">Pepfralcon <span class="level">CR 9</span></p>
<p class="description">This flaming bird is the size of a man and resembles the fabled phoenix, though far smaller. It flaps its wings and its burning feathers flutter all around, it surrounding the creature in a haze of heat.</p>

<h4><span id="Fiery_Flurry_Ex">Fiery Flurry (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> made by a pepfralcon deal +1d6 fire damage as its plumage scatters with each violent movement. Any creature that strikes a pepfralcon with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural weapon</a> or without a melee weapon that grants reach takes 1d6 fire damage as the shed feathers whip at their limbs in response. These feathers never ignite flammable materials.</p>
<h4><span id="Flaming_Feathers_Ex">Flaming Feathers (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The pepfralcon can fling its fiery plumage at enemies within 20 feet (any farther and the quills are consumed in the flames). On a successful ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, targets take 1d8+2 fire damage and make a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or catch on fire.</p>
<h4><span id="Hovering_Firestorm_Ex">Hovering Firestorm (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> a pepfralcon can create a miniature tempest centered around the square it occupies. This maneuver provokes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>. The pepfralcon spins wildly and swiftly whips out feathers that turn a 30-ft.-radius into a tempest of flames that deal 6d6+12 fire damage (DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> halves). Any flammable objects in the area catch fire (attended objects receive a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save).</p>
<h4><span id="Hovering_Inferno_Ex">Hovering Inferno (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Any round in which a pepfralcon does not take a full movement, any squares adjacent to their path of movement (including squares they briefly occupy) are filled with its scorching plumage as the bird sheds fiery feathers everywhere it goes. Creatures in any of these squares make a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or take 1d6+2 fire damage (success negates). Normally these feathers burn out before igniting materials, but as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> the pepfralcon can intensify its feathersâ heat to ignite flammable materials.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any non-cold<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>The pepfralcon is a swift, dangerous, and powerful predator of the skies. These unlikely avians are fastidiously bred and raised as a means to control rampant biddlywink populations (their natural prey). Only the enigmatic members of that mysterious group understand the complex mating and birthing habits of the scorching predators or where they are indigenous to, secrets they protect with their lives. Pepfralcons instinctively recognize the organizationâs symbol after centuries of incessant imprinting and are rarely found without one of the perplexing agents nearby.</p>

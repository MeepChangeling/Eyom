<h4><span id="Anticipation_Ex">Anticipation (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A whisperer applies its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> modifier to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative">initiative</a> checks and as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus">insight bonus</a> to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class">Armor Class</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Aura_of_Whispers_Su">Aura of Whispers (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Within 120 feet of a whisperer, the effects of its primeval landscape are significantly quickened.Â Creatures in the primeval landscape must attempt <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saves once per round to avoid its effects, rather than once per day.</p>
<h4><span id="Compel_Sacrifice_Su">Compel Sacrifice (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a whisperer uses its triggered <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> on a creature currently under the influence of its primeval landscape, it can implant a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion">suggestion</a> to perform an act of self-destruction, such as â<em>The next time you speak to someone you love, you will instead tell them you have found something better to love and then walk into the nearest body of water and drown yourself.</em>â</p>
<h4><span id="Cursed_Wound_Su">Cursed Wound (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Damage caused by a whispererâs mist tendrils overcomes all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> and ignores all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a>, but damage the tendrils deal to objects is halved. Mist tendril damage does not heal naturally. A character attempting to use magical <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> on a creature damaged in this way must succeed at a DC 31 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> check or the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> has no effect on the injured creature. Mist tendrils are primary natural <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attacks</a> that create deep, bloodless, crater-shaped wounds.</p>
<h4><span id="Inescapable_Curse_Su">Inescapable Curse (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day, a whisperer can focus its attention on a single sentient creature (any living creature with an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score of 3 or higher) within 120 feet to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> a potent curse on the target. The victim can resist this curse with a successful DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. If successful, that creature is immune to that whispererâs inescapable curse for 24 hours. If the victim fails the save, she grows increasingly obsessed with the whispererâs primeval landscape and will not voluntarily leave this region. If forced to exit this area, the victim becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a>, and the next time the victim falls asleep, she vanishes and returns to the exact point where the whisperer first placed the inescapable curse upon her, as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport">greater teleport</a>. This is a curse effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Primeval_Landscape_Su">Primeval Landscape (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature that enters a primeval landscape begins to suffer increasingly vivid and maddening hallucinations. After spending 24 hours in the region, and again every 24 hours thereafter as long as it remains in the area, a creature can attempt a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to resist being increasingly affected by the primeval landscape. Upon each failed saving throw, the creature moves one step down the following track. Casting <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration">greater restoration</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/psychic">psychic</a> surgery on an affected creature moves it one step up the track. <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle">Miracle</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a> removes all cumulative effects. Every full 24 hours spent outside of the primeval landscape, the victim moves one step up along this track. At the GMâs discretion, the whisperer can choose to not to affect specific creatures or to stop their progression at a specific step. While the effects of a primeval landscape are not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a>, mindless creatures and creatures with an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score of 2 or lower are immune to the effects. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>First Failed Save</b>: Things seem strange, and otherwise normal events or objects become ominous and unsettling.Â The victim gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> condition.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Second Failed Save</b>: The terrain seems to shift and warp while sounds are twisted into atonal parodies or blocked out by eerie whispering. In addition to being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a>, an affected creature moves at half speed and treats all other creatures as if they had <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Third Failed Save</b>: The subjectâs hallucinations crowd out actual events, and her perception bears little relationship to reality. In addition to the effects of earlier failed saves, an affected creature is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Fourth Failed Save</b>: The subjectâs autonomic processes begin to fail as pain and paranoia take hold. The subject is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Fifth Failed Save</b>: The victim is slain.</p>
<h4><span id="Rejuvenate_Su">Rejuvenate (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A whisperer that is killed reappears in its primeval landscape at the next new moon.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent a whisperer from rejuvenating is to remove the primeval landscape effect before the whispererâs rejuvenation.</p>
<h4><span id="Unsuspected_Su">Unsuspected (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature that attempts a save against any of a whispererâs abilities is unaware that it has done so unless obvious visual evidence is present. Under such circumstances, the GM should roll saving throws for player characters in secret.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any wilderness<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> double</p>
<p>Civilization spreads like an invasive species, destroying and consuming, transforming and dominating. There are some realms, thoughâprimeval and pristine tracts of wildernessâthat civilization will never claim. These are the whisperersâ domains.</p>
<p>The whisperers are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> in the most otherworldly and alien way possible. They resent those who trespass on their primeval landscapes, the lone exceptions being the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> that rise from the spirits of their victims or those <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> who, by their natures or through cruel fate, have fallen to evil. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> seek out the whispererâs realm, both for the protection it provides and because they find its alien presence strangely euphoric; they often delight in leading intruders into the whispererâs grasp.</p>
<p>A whispererâs domain is nearly as hostile to intruders as the whisperer itself is. Lethal hazards, unexplainable occurrences, and eerie happenings are common in a primeval landscape, as are haunts formed from previous trespassers. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">Plant</a> creatures and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a> attack viciously, and even âordinaryâ plants seem hostile to intruders.</p>
<p>A whisperer is 15 feet tall and, being <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a>, is completely weightless.</p>

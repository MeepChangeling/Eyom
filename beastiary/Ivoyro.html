<h4><span id="Loathsome_Bite_Su">Loathsome Bite (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An ivoyroâs bite fills any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> it strikes with intense self-loathing. Each time an ivoyro hits a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> foe with its bite attack, the victim becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1 round unless it resists the effect with a successful DC 17 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. A creature already <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> by loathsome bite becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1 round instead. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Touch_of_Irony_Su">Touch of Irony (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An ivoyro can make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> to immediately transform a living creature into a walrus for 10 minutes. A successful DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save negates the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transformation">transformation</a>. This effect otherwise functions as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape">beast shape</a> II. A creature who successfully saves is not subject to the same ivoyroâs touch of irony for 24 hours. If the target transforms into a walrus, it must also succeed on a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to retain its personality. On a failed save, the target is affected as if it failed its secondary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save against a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/baleful-polymorph">baleful polymorph</a> spell. The effect can be negated by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/break-enchantment">break enchantment</a> (DC 19 â using the ivoyroâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a>), but cannot be dispelled. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold oceans and swamps<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or herd (3â12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>An oily sheen covers the corpulent body of a blubbery, vaguely humanoid creature with a protrusive, droopy snout ending in thick whiskers. In addition to its humanoid arms and legs, a vestigial pair of flippers extends from its hips. Its broad, rounded head has forward-facing eyes and tiny ears. Crooked, yellow teeth fill the dark confines of its mouth.</p>
<p>Centuries ago, icy blue sails appeared on the horizon near a remote, polar coastline. Bearing the colors of a notoriously amoral band of commercial hunters, the vesselâs jubilant crew peered toward shore and lustily celebrated the breathtaking sight they beheld. In the distance, hundreds of plump walruses congregated together within a sheltered inlet. The avaricious captain immediately steered the mighty ship toward his lucrative bounty, tabulating the countless coins he and his charges would earn from their unprecedented haul of ivory, oil, and meat. But a nasty surprise awaited the captain and his greedy shipmates. Their reputation for wanton slaughter and disrespect for nature earned them the wrath of the indigenous people and their goddess Freya. Although the walruses were undoubtedly real, druids in her service summoned the animals to this location to lure the men into a deadly trap. When the hunters drew their weapons, legend claims that the druids â and in some versions, the deity herself â cursed them for their transgressions, transforming them into misshapen creatures that vaguely resembled their aquatic prey.</p>
<p>Although no one can definitively verify the tale, several of the ivoyroâs features suggest the story bears some seeds of truthfulness. If the creature underwent a dramatic and harrowing metamorphosis into a malevolent monstrosity, its boundless rapaciousness survived the alteration intact. Moreover, the vain captain and his equally conceited subordinates boasted of their handsomeness during their exploits. However, the monsters now greatly loath the abominations they became, adding further credence to the ivoyroâs mythical origins. Instead, they compensate for their shattered pride by indulging their insatiable appetite for riches and slaughter. The monsters typically patrol the waters surrounding polar harbors and coastal villages, where they wait until darkness falls before launching a savage attack against the surprised inhabitants. Although they are equally at home in the water or on land, they prefer attacking ships at anchor in the dead of night. Ivoyros covet precious metals, art objects, and magical items above all other treasures, causing them to target their owners before all other enemies. On the other hand, they detest ivory, scrimshaw, and other commodities made from the bone of any aquatic mammal.</p>
<p>An ivoyro appears as a rotund humanoid with sagging, leathery skin bearing discolored splotches and clumps of misplaced whiskers on its belly, armpit, and hips.</p>

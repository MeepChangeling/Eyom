<h4><span id="Construction_Points"><a name="TOC-Construction-Points"></a>Construction Points</span></h4>
<p>Necrocrafts have a number of Construction Points (CP) used to purchase abilities and defenses. A Medium necrocraft has 2 CP; differently sized necrocrafts have CP totals as detailed on the size chart. If a necrocraft is built with more CP than its size category would allow, its CR increases by 1 (minimum of +1) for every 2 additional CP spent. Unless otherwise stated, each of these abilities can be purchased only once. The stats presented here are for a Medium necrocraft (with 2 CP spent on additional movement [fly] and extra attack [bite]).</p>
<p><b>Additional Movement (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>, 1 CP)</b>: The necrocraft gains a new mode of movement (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a>, climb, fly [clumsy], or swim) at a speed equal to its base speed.</p>
<p><b>All-Around Vision (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>, 2 CP)</b>: The necrocraft has an additional head facing in the opposite direction from its main head, or has extra eyes grafted at various points around its body. The necrocraft gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-All-Around-Vision-Ex-">all-around vision</a>.</p>
<p><b>Blade Fists (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>, 1 CP)</b>: Up to two of the necrocraft’s claw attacks are replaced with sharpened bones or metal blades. These attacks deal 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> damage. This ability can be selected multiple times, applying it to more claw attacks.</p>
<p><b>Bone Armor (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>, 1 CP)</b>: Fortified with extra bone (perhaps including bones fused to its outer surface like armor), the necrocraft increases its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a> by 2. This ability can be selected up to three times.</p>
<p><b>Cannibalize (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>, 1 CP)</b>: If the necrocraft is left near the corpse of a Medium or larger creature with discernible anatomy, it eats the corpse or tears off parts to repair its own substance. An <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature consumed in this fashion heals the necrocraft 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> plus 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> per size category above Medium; any other type of creature restores only 1/5 this amount. Feeding takes 1 hour; any interruption (such as combat) requires it to start again.</p>
<p><b>Constrict (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>, 1 CP)</b>: The necrocraft’s claw attacks gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a> ability. It must have <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a> before this ability can be selected.</p>
<p><b>Disease (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">Su</a>, 1 CP)</b>: One of the necrocraft’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> is grafted with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghoul</a> mouthparts, exposing a creature it hits to ghoul fever.</p>

A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghouls</a>, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghoul</a> in all respects.

<p><b>Extra Legs (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>, 1 CP)</b>: The necrocraft gains two more legs, increasing its base speed by 5 feet and increasing its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a> against <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip">trip</a> attempts by 4.

<p><b>Metal Armor (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-">Ex</a>, 2 CP)</b>: Metal plates are bolted to or fused with the necrocraft, serving as armor and granting it a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor bonus</a> to AC.</p>

<p>A necrocraft is a medley of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> body parts and corpses grafted together with dark magic to create a single animated <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature with abilities based on its component pieces and the surgical and necromantic talents of its creator. Necrocrafts are better suited for brute force than delicate manipulation, and most creators build larger hulks rather than smaller, more agile (and fragile) necrocrafts. Though necrocrafts can be of virtually any size and can be made up of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> bodies or parts of any size, a typical Medium specimen is 7 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.</p>
<p>The details of the ritual to create a necrocraft vary greatly, and depend on the particular undead parts used and the intended size of the resulting creature. The final anatomy of the creation largely depends on the master’s artistry, creativity, and personal preferencesâas well as any specific goals it has in mind for the creature. For example, a necrocraft’s “teeth” could actually be dozens of clawed ghoul talons, or its eyes and mouth might be located in its chest rather than in a distinct head.</p>
<h3><span id="Creating_a_Necrocraft"><a name="TOC-Creating-a-Necrocraft"></a>Creating a Necrocraft</span></h3>
<p>In order to create a necrocraft, a spellcaster must use at least five <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures (or their corpses), all of which must be under the creator’s control, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a>, or slain. A larger <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> or corpse can be used in place of two that are one size smaller. The creator must stitch, glue, or otherwise bind the parts together in the desired conf iguration, then cast <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead">animate dead</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/make-whole">make whole</a> to complete the construction (the material component cost of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead">animate dead</a> is 50 gp per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> of the final necrocraft). The creator can’t create a necrocraft with more <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> than her <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a>. As with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead">animate dead</a>, the necrocraft is under the creator’s control when created. Note that creating a necrocraft requires casting a spell with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Evil">evil descriptor</a>.</p>

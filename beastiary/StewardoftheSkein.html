<h1>Steward of the Skein</h1>
<p class="description">This plate-clad woman has large bird wings augmented with overlapping pieces of metal. Her armor is adorned with skulls, and her open-faced helm reveals nothing of her features but a pair of intensely-glowing eyes.</p>

<p>The Steward of the Skein is a mighty warrior sent to restore the balance of fate, announce a particularly auspicious birth or death, or deliver a world-shaking prophecy. Many times her presence is as an incorporeal shade, making a pronouncement and then fading away, though countless creatures over the eons have felt the stunning impact of her armored fists. No mortal can recall seeing her and her role as messenger of prophecy has all but disappeared since that time.</p>
<h4><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h4>
<p>The Steward only kills when it is her gods will. She prefers to use her stunning gaze, her charm and hold magic, and similar <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage">nonlethal</a> methods for dealing with opponents, giving them ample opportunities to flee. She is sparse with her healing, only using it to save those who are needed for future eventsâwhen present at great battles in history, she healed only a few, and restored but one or two who had recently died. The herald is ruthless when dealing with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, however, blasting them with her full power.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society">Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>The Steward is a loner and has little interest in the desires of mortals. She is more personable with other planar servitors of her creator, but her unique role places her above them in the religious hierarchy, and she does not like fraternizing too much with her underlings lest she distract them. Conversely, she is extremely interested when one of the goddessâs other servants is due to give birth or die. Though the Steward has no interest in procreating on her own, any celestial or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/half-celestial">half-celestial</a> birth is especially interesting to her, from both a physical and a spiritual standpoint whose presence would certainly overwhelm the newborn and confuse its role in the tapestry of fate. Likewise, she has an almost morbid curiosity about one of her fellow servitors dying, and has an almost-precognitive sense for such things, making her sudden appearance next to other servants in the Material Plane slightly worrisome.</p>
<p>Occasionally she is called to testify about the deeds or fate of a particular soul. When not following a direct order from the goddess, the Steward has been known to travel the planes slaying <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>. She relishes the opportunity to chase and slaughter <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>.</p>

<h1>Ahlinni</h1>
<p class="description">This creature has a long, straight beakâfully half the length of its bodyâthat tapers to a fine point. Wicked claws sprout from its wings. Its eyes are whitish-pink and its feathers are a mixture of blues, reds, yellows, and greens.</p>

<h4><span id="Birdsong_Su"><a name="TOC-Birdsong-Su-"></a>Birdsong (Su)</span></h4>
<p> An ahlinni can freely communicate with any bird or bird-like creature (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/roc" target="_blank">rocs</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/giant-eagle" target="_blank">giant eagles</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Giant" target="_blank">giant</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/owl" target="_blank">owls</a>), perfectly mimicking any bird song or vocalization. Communication with non-intelligent bird creatures is on an empathic level, and can only take place if the bird is within 100 feet of the ahlinni. In these cases, this ability functions as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals" target="_blank">speak with animals</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level" target="_blank">caster level</a> 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated. The ahlinni can restart it as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions" target="_blank">free action</a> on its next turn.</p>
<h4><span id="Impale_Ex"><a name="TOC-Impale-Ex-"></a>Impale (Ex)</span></h4>
<p> When an ahlinni charges a foe, it deals double damage on a successful strike with its bite attack.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate or cold forests and marshes<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or flock (4â7)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> no coins; standard goods (gems only); no items </p>
<p>The ahlinni, or cackle bird, is a flightless bird that dwells in the treetops of thick forests or canopies of thick marsh trees. It is covered in greenish feathers of varying hues, and when it lies motionless in its leafy surroundings it is nearly invisible. Cackle birds live in small flocks, and their laughter-like calls can be heard for great distances through the woods they call home. They have an affinity for small sparkly objects, and often line their nests with bits of colored glass or gemstones in order to attract a mate.</p>
<p>An ahlinni attacks first with its breath weapon and, being cowardly, usually flees the encounter if possible. When on the offensive, an ahlinni leaps from its treetop and attempts to impale its opponent on its beak.</p>

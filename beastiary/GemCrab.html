After a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> is initiated, whenever a gem crab makes a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> it deals its maximum bite damage and receives a free attack with its claw.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> gem crab can be struck with a weapon (though creatures not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> by it take a â4 penalty to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a> against it) or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> itself; to remove an dug in gem crab through <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a>, the opponent must successfully <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pin</a> it.</p>

<p>Creatures within 30 ft. of a gem crab make a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or are compelled to pick up and hold the creature; effectively, the creature unknowingly begins a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> with the gem crab whenever they pick it up. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Varied_Linguist_Su">Varied Linguist (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once it has been with a host or owner for a week, a gem crab learns to speak that creatureâs language. Its conversation is mostly about gems in general, their value, why creatures will want to take it from the owner, why the owner should do more to protect it, how the owner can gain more treasure, and why it deserves more of its own treasure.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary (in a chained-pendant), wristlet (3-5 embedded within), necklace (6-10 arrayed on a golden cord), treasure hoard (11-20)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Gem crabs can appear to be any type of gem or jewel of any value, although like a hermit crab, gem crab moves from one jewel to another of ever increasing worth as it gets older and wishes to attract more victims. As a general rule, the shell of a gem crab is worth 20d10 gp x its HD. A gem crab never appears in the hoard of creature with more than twice its own HD.</p>
<p>A gem crab is an avaricious creature looking to gain a pile of its own treasure to rest on whenever possible, although it can never actually own or move anything. These curiosities sit on another creatureâs possessions and instinctively prefer to be the most valuable item in a pile (often bringing it into conflict with the host owner). When its trespass is noticed the Diminutive <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast">magical beasts</a> make deals to draw looters in and then help the host defend the pile, aiding in the defeat of would-be robbers (using <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> to distract enemies) If suitably flattered and given sufficient other gems to live on (at least twenty times the value of its own shell) a gem crab becomes a special <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/familiar">familiar</a> to a neutral or neutral evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizard</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">sorcerer</a>, granting its master a +3 bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/appraise">Appraise</a> checks. When it thinks its owner is not paying enough attention to it, a gem crab uses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion">compulsion</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> ability to be admired (though in this case it does not attack, soaking in vanity rather than blood).</p>
<p>Gem crabs range from barely an inch across to almost six inches in diameter; a gem crab is roughly one inch in diameter for every two <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. However, it is rumored that gem crabs of unimaginable size and power live and thrive on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elemental-Planes">Elemental Planes</a> of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Earth">Earth</a>, a plane they have moved to and found to be to their liking. Tales of elder <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental/elemental-earth">earth elementals</a> battling with gem crabs the size of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/elephant/elephant">elephants</a> can be found in the rarest of ancient Dwarven texts, although most consider them to be nothing more than childrenâs fables.</p>

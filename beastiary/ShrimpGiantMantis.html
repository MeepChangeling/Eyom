<h4><a name="TOC-Incredible-Sight-Ex-"></a>Incredible Sight (Ex)</h4>
<p>A giant mantis shrimp’s eyes pick up colors well beyond those visible to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a>, and it can see perfectly in all light conditions, including <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness">darkness</a>. As long as the giant mantis shrimp is not <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a>, it is treated as having <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> 60 feet.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Sonic-Burst-Ex-"></a>Sonic Burst (Ex)</h4>
<p>A giant mantis shrimp attacks with such extreme speed that its pincers issue a concussive blast of light and force when they snap closed. Each time a giant mantis shrimp makes a pincer attack, whether it hits or misses, each creature in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on the attack’s target takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stun</a> effect from additional sonic bursts from that giant mantis shrimp until the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin">vermin’s</a> next turn, but it still takes sonic damage from additional sonic bursts. The giant mantis shrimp is immune to this effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Speedy-Pincers-Ex-"></a>Speedy Pincers (Ex)</h4>
<p>A giant mantis shrimp can make iterative attacks with one pincer.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> warm coastlines<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Though the colorful shells of giant mantis shrimp are beautiful to behold, the sight of one often means death.</p>
<p>These apex predators prowl tide pools and coastal shallows, competing for territory with karkinoi and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/shark/shark">shark</a> eater <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/crab">crabs</a>.</p>
<p>A typical giant mantis shrimp grows to 4 feet high and 6 feet long, and weighs around 200 pounds.</p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Variants"></a>Variants</h3>
<p>Their incredible eyesight and deadly pincers make giant mantis shrimp formidable predators in any environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cave Mantis Shrimp</b>: A cave mantis shrimp has adapted to life in caves, losing its coastal cousin’s vibrant shell and becoming almost translucent. A cave mantis shrimp gains a +8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks and can take a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> when it acts on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Surprise">surprise</a> round.</li>
<li><b>Mantis Shrimp Lord</b>: Found on the seabed in deeper waters than its smaller relatives, mantis shrimp lords are Large. Their attacks ignore the first 20 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> when attacking objects, which the mantis shrimp lords use to their advantage, scuttling ships and devouring the unfortunate cargoes and crews.</li>
<li><b>Sand Mantis Shrimp</b>: Sand mantis shrimp bury themselves in deserts, waiting for passersby to approach a little too close to their claws. A sand mantis shrimp loses the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a> subtype.</li>

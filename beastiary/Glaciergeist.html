<h4><span id="Buoyant_Ex">Buoyant (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The icy body of a glaciergeist automatically floats in water, and the creature must succeed a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim">Swim</a> check every round in order to stay submerged.</p>
<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su">Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> creature that dies of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suffocation">suffocation</a> while immured by a glaciergeist (see below) rises as a glaciergeist 24 hours after its death, as long as it is still embedded in the ice at this time. These glaciergeists are free willed, but friendly towards the glaciergeist that created them. They do not possess any of the class abilities they had in life.</p>
<h4><span id="Freezing_Clutches_Su">Freezing Clutches (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> by a glaciergeist must succeed a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save each round or take 2d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Dexterity damage</a>. A successful save reduces this to 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Dexterity damage</a>. Creatures immune to cold are immune to this effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Ice_Glide_Su">Ice Glide (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A glaciergeist can use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed" style="font-style: italic;">speed</a> to move through ice without penalty, as easily as a fish swims through water. It leaves no tunnel or trace of its passage. It can only use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed" style="font-style: italic;">speed</a> in ice.</p>
<h4><span id="Immure_Su">Immure (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a glaciergeist can make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check against an opponent it already has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Drag">drag</a> them into the ice five feet below. It can then let go and attack other creatures, or continue to attack the same creatureâa glaciergeist cannot <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Drag">drag</a> creatures more than five feet into the ice. A creature that is dragged into the ice is immobilized and begins to suffocate. An immured creature can only take mental actions or attempt to escape by making a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check against the glaciergeistâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a>. If it succeeds, it loosens the ice around itself sufficiently to take physical actions (as if swallowed whole). Ice has a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> of 0, 3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> per inch of thickness and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> to fire for the purposes of tunneling out of the ice.</p>
<p>This being appears as a desiccated corpse embedded in a block of ice, its eyes hate-filled and face contorted into a rictus. Its ice-block is human-shaped, but twice the size of the corpse within, moving its limbs in mimicry of the movements of the interior carcass.</p>
<p>The first glaciergeist was created when an evil creature was buried in an avalanche and died of exposure on desecrated ground. Some still form this way, and are thus common near mountain shrines to foul deities. However, they are capable of creating more of their kind by trapping humanoid foes in the ice and allowing them to suffocate. Some glaciergeists follow their glaciers out to sea, and drift as tiny, wicked icebergs along currents before coming to new and distant shores.</p>
<p>Glaciergeists are strange ambush hunters, swimming through ice in order to strike at creatures walking along the surface. They know that their reproduction requires a creature to be properly suffocated, not merely slain, and thus focus their attention on immuring at least one victim. If fighting a single target, they may spend several rounds draining the mobility from their grappled enemies with shivering cold before depositing them under the ice. If confronting multiple enemies, they will usually try to act faster, dragging down and immuring an enemy before returning to the surface to prevent the allies of their victim from rescuing the unfortunate. They have no ranged capacity, or defense against fire. Foes that are skilled with these techniques will not be fought head on, rather tracked and ambushed while sleeping or otherwise distracted.</p>
<p>Although a glaciergeist does not control its spawn, such creatures are typically friendly towards their âparentâ. A glaciergeist with developing spawn may camp near the field where corpses are immured to guard them against scavenging beasts or do-gooding adventurers. They do not intentionally collect treasure, but valuables may be found on the humanoid corpses embedded in the icy shell of a glaciergeist. Armor and weapons will not function for these creatures, but any wondrous items or rings embedded may still grant the monster their benefit (GMâs discretion). A glaciergeist cannot speak, but they understand at least one language. Their immured faces can be seen mouthing words silently as they fight.</p>

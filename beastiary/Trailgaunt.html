<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su">Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> creature killed by a trailgaunt becomes a trailgaunt itself at the next sunset as long as the body is both unburied and not within line of sight of a well-maintained road. Spawn so created are free-willed and do not have any of the abilities they had in life.</p>
<h4><span id="Loathing_Ex">Loathing (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A trailgaunt cannot cross a wellmaintained road. It can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Burrow-Ex-">burrow</a> under it or climb over it, but it cannot walk across such a barrier. A trailgaunt forced onto a wellmaintained road must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save at the start of each round or be unable to take any actions.</p>
<h4><span id="Mutter_Su">Mutter (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A trailgauntâs pain-filled muttering and groaning is distressing to hear. A creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of a trailgaunt must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> for 1 minute. Multiple failed saving throws against a trailgauntâs mutter do not increase this effect to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a>. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> sonic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Pain_Su">Pain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature damaged by a trailgauntâs bite or claws must succeed at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> by pain in its legs and feet for 1 round. Creatures in contact with the ground take a â1 penalty on this saving throw. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Sudden_Lunge_Ex">Sudden Lunge (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Once per minute, a trailgaunt can lurch into a burst of motion, gaining a speed of 40 feet for 1 round.</p>
<h4><span id="Sure_Stride_Su">Sure Stride (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A trailgauntâs speed is never reduced by difficult terrain, and it can take a 5-foot step in such conditions.</p>
<h4><span id="Vengeful_Strike_Ex">Vengeful Strike (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A trailgaunt hates merchants, pilgrims, and others who spend lots of time traveling, and gains a +2 bonus on all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> checks against such targets.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land (wilderness)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or pack (3â10)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>The dreaded trailgaunt is a form of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> that plagues regions where travelers have long trod the roads. Legends hold that trailgaunts rise from the remains of seasoned travelers who became lost and then perished from exposure or starvation, suffering great shame and humiliation to have come to such unexpected and lonely ends in addition to their physical torment.</p>
<p>Trailgaunts seek travelers to avenge themselves upon and are driven to feast upon the feet of those they slaughter, often leaving the maimed bodies to rise as new trailgaunts with the setting of the next sun. Trailgaunts with intact feet are rare, yet even those fortunate enough to retain all their toes are <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> and clumsy.</p>
<p>Trailgaunts are particularly feared in nomadic societies, and stories of how these <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures relentlessly stalk those who commit crimes are popular. The most common tales focus on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/hunter">hunter</a> who abandons a partner in the wild and then prospers on the profits of the hunt for a year before the betrayed partner finally catches up to the traitor and kills him as he sleeps.</p>
<p>Many variations on this tale exist, but they inevitably revolve around themes of treachery and relentless pursuit.</p>

<p>A doppeldrek’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Change-Shape-Su-">change shape</a> ability allows it to take the form of a living creature that it senses with its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> ability. Although a doppeldrek is normally mindless, its skill at mimicry is sufficient to reproduce intelligence. While it maintains the shape of a creature with 1 or 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a>, it gains an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score of that value. If it mimics a creature with a higher intelligence, the doppeldrek still only gains an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score of 2.</p>
<p>When a doppeldrek gains an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score, it gains skill ranks equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>, which it always places in the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a> skill. This ability otherwise functions as normal for <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Change-Shape-Su-">change shape</a>. If the doppeldrek takes the shape of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aberration">aberration</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animal</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast">magical beast</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin">vermin</a>, it gains any of the creature’s abilities listed in <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape">beast shape IV</a>. If it takes the shape of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Monstrous-Humanoid">monstrous humanoid</a>, it instead gains any of the creature’s abilities listed in monstrous physique IV. Finally, if it takes the shape of a plant, it gains any of the creature’s abilities listed in <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i">plant shape III</a>. A doppeldrek can’t mimic other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a>, nor can it mimic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or group (1 disguised as a creature plus an assortment of creatures of that type)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>In their natural form, doppeldreks are pale blobs, with an appearance akin to sea foam. However, doppeldreks habitually mimic other creatures that they detect with their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsense</a>, taking on not only their shapes but also some of their innate abilities, and even some of their intelligence. A doppeldrek using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Change-Shape-Su-">change shape</a> ability believes itself to be whatever type of creature it is currently mimicking, and its behavior matches the behavior typical of that type of creature, as far as its intelligence allows. When a doppeldrek attempts to copy a creature with substantially greater intelligence, such as the average <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>, it attempts to follow the creature around, constantly copying its behavior and making vocalizations that are too imprecise to be recognizable as speech. An isolated doppeldrek eventually reverts to its natural form.</p>
<p>Occasionally, through exposure to potent magic or other means, a doppeldrek gains a persistent intelligence and personality, becoming an awakened doppeldrek. An awakened doppeldrek possesses an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score of 6 or higher, and can use its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Change-Shape-Su-">change shape</a> ability to mimic an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score up to double its own. An awakened doppeldrek must still put a number of skill ranks equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise">Disguise</a>, but can allocate its other skill ranks as it sees fit each time it assumes a new form.</p>

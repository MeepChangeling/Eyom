<h4><span id="Breath_of_Flies_Su">Breath of Flies (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Every 1d4 rounds as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, Apollyon can exhale a cloud of flies in a 60-foot cone. Those caught in the area take 18d6 points of piercing damage from the bites and are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 42 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save takes half the normal damage and negates the nausea effect. Any creature that takes any damage at all from the flies is automatically <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1 minute. The flies linger for 1d4+1 rounds, gathering at the start of Apollyonâs next turn into a buzzing 20-foot-square cloud centered on the coneâs point of origin. Any creature that ends its turn in this cloud must succeed at a DC 42 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or take 9d6 points of piercing damage and become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a> for 1 minute. This cloud of flies can be dispersed by any area effect that deals damage or creates strong or stronger wind.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> and apocalypse horses are immune to the effects of breath of flies. The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Disease_Ex">Disease (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Those bitten by Apollyon risk contracting soul plague, a deadly affliction that causes flesh to rot and drip away and that fills the sufferer with overwhelming despair and nausea. The soul of a creature that dies from soul plague is consigned to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a> to become one of the hunted of that realm, regardless of the victimâs actual <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> and religion in life. Soul plague can be cured via magic but cannot be cured through normal rest.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> (but no more than once per day per target), Apollyon can inflict upon a single target within 60 feet any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> that the creature has ever previously suffered, unless the target succeeds at a DC 38 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save. The onset is immediate and this ability affects creatures immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> unless they are of demigod or greater stature, though creatures immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> gain a +4 bonus on their saving throws.

<h4><span id="Plague_Shadow_Su">Plague Shadow (Su)</span></h4>

Creatures within a 10-foot radius of Apollyon are subject to damage from this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a>. Any creatures in the area occupied by the plague <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/shadow">shadow</a> at the end of Apollyonâs turn take 5d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> damage and must succeed at a DC 38 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1 round.

<p>Apollyon has ruled for eons, since he seized his throne and slew all potential rivals following the disappearance of his presumed-dead predecessor. The Horseman of Pestilence is also known as the Prince of Plagues, and rules from his domain of the Plaguemere, a vast realm of swamps, flooded forests, and shallow, acidic oceans. His citadel, the Throne of Flies, is carved from a titanic spinal column and set of ribs, rumored to be those of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> god of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> or a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Protean">protean</a> lord slaughtered by the Four and dragged back to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a> to feast upon.</p>
<p>While other horsemen engage in more overt acts of brutality against the mortals of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, Apollyon and his servitors focus instead on their distinct form of creation: the crafting of new diseases and plagues capable of doing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemonsâ</a> work for them, spreading across the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a> in virulent pandemics. Less known is the fact that these acts of creation also extend to artifacts and magical items intended to corrupt their recipients, and even larger metaphysical infestations that work within the goddess of deathâs system to taint souls and condemn them to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a> after judgment.</p>
<p>Apollyon frequently sends his minions to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, and their actions there leave behind contagious diseases long after theyâre killed or banished. When spreading ever more horrific and virulent plagues, the Horseman is not averse to granting temporary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to his mortal cultists in exchange for using them as carriers and living incubators, though this protection is short-livedâeventually, they too fall and their souls are carried to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a> amid clouds of corpse flies.</p>
<h3 class="header"><span id="Apollyons_Cult">Apollyonâs Cult</span></h3>
<p>Apollyon is worshiped by those who carry, suffer from, or use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>, including neutral evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druids</a>, vengeful lepers, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/lycanthrope/wererat">wererats</a> and the like.

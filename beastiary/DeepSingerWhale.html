<p>Deep singer whales are not normally aggressive, preferring to use their entrancing song ability or various spell-like abilities to calm hostile creatures. If unsuccessful it will attack with its various sonic spell-like abilities or as a last resort, engage opponents in melee combat, striking with their devastating tail slaps.</p>

<h4><span id="Entrancing_Harmonies_Su"><a name="TOC-Entrancing-Harmonies-Su-"></a>Entrancing Harmonies (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The music of a deep singer whale is of such beauty that it can entrance all who hear it. After one full round of singing, all those within 1,000 feet who can hear the song must succeed on a DC 27 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or stop what they are doing and simply listen. Entranced creatures that suffer damage get a new save, with a bonus equal to the damage inflicted. The entrancing effect lasts for as long as the whale sings, and a deep singer whale can maintain an entrancing harmony for as long as it has air. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Spell-Like_Abilities_Sp"><a name="TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-"></a>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A deep singer whale can cast spells as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a> of a level equal to half their hit dice, rounded down. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a> for these spells are always verbal only.</p>
<h4><span id="Pressure_Immunity_Ex"><a name="TOC-Pressure-Immunity-Ex-"></a>Pressure Immunity (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A deep singer whale is immune to pressure damage at any depth.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any aquatic<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary (or very rarely, a pod of 2-6) plus a <span>company of 2â4 </span><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/merfolk">merfolk</a><span> or </span>a company of 2â5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/triton">tritons</a> plus a pod of 3â18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cetacean/dolphin/dolphin">dolphins</a><br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>Only in the deepest oceans can one find the deep singers, a race of intelligent whales that sing with an entrancing harmony, and that are said to be the repositories of all the seaâs wisdom. Deep singers can travel to any depth in the ocean without harm, but are air breathers nonetheless and can be found on the surface replenishing its air supply. Its haunting songs can be heard sometimes echoing among the waves, rising from the deeps, and are of such melancholy beauty that even the most hardened sailors find tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>Deep singer whales are often accompanied by a retinue of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cetacean/dolphin/dolphin">dolphins</a> and intelligent, non-evil sea <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/merfolk">merfolk</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/triton">tritons</a>, who come to learn from the whalesâ song, and bring them information of the world beyond.</p>
<p>Some believe that deep singer whales are the first stage in the evolution of the celestial whales that swim in the oceans of the outer planes. Others believe that they are avatars of those beings, come to the world to increase their knowledge and experience before returning.</p>

<p><b>During Combat</b> The clockwork reliquary lashes at the closest target with its djezet blood on the 1st round of combat, then triggers its abysium pulse in the 2nd round. It uses these abilities as often as it can. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> uses <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/telekinesis">telekinesis</a> to try to wrench the most powerful weapon or powerful item away from its controller (treat this as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a>, but grant the defender a +10 bonus to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a>), mixing melee and ranged attacks as appropriate in a round (it prefers attacking with its claws). If reduced to fewer than 150 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it casts <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/repulsion">repulsion</a> and uses <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/chain-lightning">chain lightning</a> to keep foes at range while using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Fast_Healing_Ex">fast healing</a>.</p>

<h4><span id="Abysium_Pulse_Su"><a name="TOC-Abysium-Pulse-Su-"></a>Abysium Pulse (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once every 1d4 rounds as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>, the two <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a> spheres atop the clockwork reliquaryâs body can bloom like metal flowers to reveal highly refined abysium rods that immediately pulse with energy. All creatures within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or suffer 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Constitution drain</a> and become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1 round. On a successful save, creatures in the area suffer only 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Constitution drain</a> and are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round. The reliquary cannot create an abysium pulse in the same round it lashes out with its djezet blood. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. </p>
<h4><span id="Alloyed_Claws_Ex"><a name="TOC-Alloyed-Claws-Ex-"></a>Alloyed Claws (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The clockwork reliquaryâs claws are crafted from a strange alloy of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a> and siccatite. These claws threaten a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> on a result of 19â20 and deal Ã4 damage on a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>. They always add 1-1/2 times the reliquaryâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> modifier on damage rolls. The claws bypass <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> as if they were made of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a>, and on a hit, the reliquary can decide to deal +1d6 points of fire damage or +1d6 points of cold damage as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. </p>
<h4><span id="Conquer_Construct_Su"><a name="TOC-Conquer-Construct-Su-"></a>Conquer Construct (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, the clockwork reliquary can target a single mindless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> within 120 feet and attempt to seize control of it. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> can attempt to resist this control with a DC 33 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save, but on a failure, it permanently falls under the clockwork reliquaryâs command. If the reliquary targets a dormant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> (such as an unwound clockwork), the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> fails the save automatically and is immediately activated at the start of the next round. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. </p>
<h4><span id="Djezet_Blood_Su"><a name="TOC-Djezet-Blood-Su-"></a>Djezet Blood (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The clockwork reliquaryâs âbloodâ is composed of djezet. Once every 1d4 rounds as a free action, the reliquary may lash out at a single creature within 30 feet with a tendril of this blood. The reliquary must attempt a +36 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>; if it hits, the target must succeed at a DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or become more susceptible to the reliquaryâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-">supernatural</a> attacks and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, taking a â10 penalty on all saving throws against these attacks for 24 hours. The reliquary cannot use its blood in this way during the same round it creates an abysium pulse. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based. </p>
<h4><span id="Haunted_Ex"><a name="TOC-Haunted-Ex-"></a>Haunted (Ex)</span></h4>
<p> The reliquary gains its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> bonus (+11) to its AC as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus">deflection bonus</a> and on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saves as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Resistance-Bonus">resistance bonus</a>. It gains its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> bonus (+11) to each of its Hit Dice as bonus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. </p>
<h4><span id="Inubrix_Darts_Ex"><a name="TOC-Inubrix-Darts-Ex-"></a>Inubrix Darts (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a full-round action, the clockwork reliquary may fire six inubrix darts from its upper body, or one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/ammunition/ammunition-thrown-darts">dart</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. These darts have a range increment of 90 feet and ignore any armor or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Shield-Bonus">shield bonus</a> granted by metal armor or shields. The reliquary can fire 100 darts before it must craft replacements. </p>
<h4><span id="Seven_Star_Artifact_Vulnerability_Ex"><a name="TOC-Seven-Star-Artifact-Vulnerability-Ex-"></a>Seven Star Artifact Vulnerability (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A creature equipped with the Seven Star Artifact can penetrate the clockwork reliquaryâs damage reduction with any attack, and automatically succeeds at all checks to penetrate its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. If the user transfers the artifact to an ally while the clockwork reliquary is within 30 feet, the reliquary must succeed at a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round. </p>
<h4><span id="Skymetal_Plating_Su"><a name="TOC-Skymetal-Plating-Su-"></a>Skymetal Plating (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Plates of horacalcum and noqual are incorporated into the reliquaryâs body. These plates rotate and realign every round so that one of the two materials is visible, while the other side of the plate faces inward. On even-numbered rounds, its horacalcum plates are visible and the clockwork reliquary functions as if hasted. On odd-numbered rounds, its noqual plates are visible and its spell resistance increases to 37. </p>
<h4><span id="Susceptible_to_Positive_Energy_Ex"><a name="TOC-Susceptible-to-Positive-Energy-Ex-"></a>Susceptible to Positive Energy (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The reliquary is vulnerable to damage from positive energy as if it were an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creature. It is not affected by negative energy. </p>
<h4><span id="Unstable_Mind_Ex"><a name="TOC-Unstable-Mind-Ex-"></a>Unstable Mind (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The clockwork reliquaryâs animating spirit carries with it all of spiritâs madness. At the start of every round, thereâs a cumulative 1% chance that it malfunctions in that roundâif the reliquary malfunctions, it functions for that round as if <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused">confused</a>. Presenting evidence of the spiritâs failures increases the next malfunction check by 20%. Once the reliquary malfunctions, the malfunction chance resets to 1% for the next round. </p>
<p>The clockwork reliquary is a powerful wizardâs last triumph, a construct that he never got to test in the field of battle. His spirit is eager to use the device, but even more eager to have the reliquary awaken his slumbering army of clockwork soldiers and lead them into the new world to rebuild his empire.</p>

<p>Editor’s Note – This construct is unique and the equivalent of an artifact, and as such has no construction rules.</p>

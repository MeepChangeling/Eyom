<h1>Demon, Coloxus</h1>
<p class="description">This figure would be the picture of elegance and refinement were it not for its grotesque fly head and shivering insectile wings.</p>

<h4><span id="Droning_Wings_Ex"><a name="TOC-Droning-Wings-Ex-"></a>Droning Wings (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day, when it flutters its wings as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a coloxus can create a mesmerizing display of color and a sound-dampening buzzing drone. All creatures within 30 feet that can see the coloxus must make a DC 24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be slowed for up to 6 rounds. Each subsequent round, the coloxus must take a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> to maintain the effect or the effect ceases at the end of its turn. Additionally, the sound creates a buffer against sonic energy, granting the fly demon <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to sonic attacks or effects while it continues to drone. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Siphon_Su"><a name="TOC-Siphon-Su-"></a>Siphon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature bitten by a coloxus must make a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a>. A coloxus heals itself of 5 points of damage for every point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> it deals. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> urban (Abyss)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> (3-8)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> double </p>
<p>Coloxus demons, known also as fly demons, resemble <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a> with the head of a fly and twin pairs of gossamer wings. Even their smallest movements and gestures seem infused with manic quickness and alertness. Ironicallyâgiven their grotesque, insectile appearanceâcoloxus demons are demons of vanity. They are formed from the souls of narcissistic mortals responsible for disasters or tragedy through their careless self-absorption. A coloxus prefers to wear opulent clothing and jewels that would rival the wealthiest nobility of any race.</p>
<p>Despite their foul appearance, coloxus demons consider themselves cultured and elite. They are unusually patient and well mannered for demons, and as a result are often used as emissaries, diplomats, and negotiators by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/marilith">marilith</a> generals, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/balor">balors</a>, and even <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords">demon lords</a>. Even when facing hated foes, coloxus demons are the epitome of courtesy, but such manners are always a deceitful veneer, masking the creatures’ efforts to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>Evil mortal spellcasters are fond of conjuring coloxus demons for similar roles, but the monsters also work well as assassins. Even in this role, a coloxus is dignified and polite. Only when presented with a reflection of itself does the normally civilized coloxus show its true demonic colorsâany creature foolish enough to trick a coloxus into looking at a mirror finds herself the eternal foe of an insulted and scandalized demon.</p>
<p>A coloxus is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. </p>

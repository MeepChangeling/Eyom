<p>Velvety antlers sprout from the skull of a hardy deer with a woolly coat of fur, wide feet, and a short tail. It stands roughly the size of a teenage boy at its shoulders.</p>
<p>These herd animals provide a source of meat for the biomeâs apex predators.</p>
<p>People also rely heavily upon these beasts for food, but they also use them for clothing, milk, labor, and transportation.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, reindeer are a species of deer specially adapted for life in cold environments. Its fur, consisting of a thick, woolly overcoat and a thinner undercoat with air-filled strands of hair, insulates the animalâs body from the elements. In addition to its outer protective layer, the reindeerâs circulatory system relies upon a countercurrent heat exchange process, which efficiently retains body heat without posing undue stress on its heart. Its large feet are ideally suited for disbursing its weight over a greater area on slick surfaces while its small cloven hooves minimize its contact with the frigid ground. On average, female reindeer weigh approximately 200 pounds. The larger males are nearly double their size weighing in at an impressive 375 pounds, though their weight wildly fluctuates on a seasonal basis.</p>

<h1>Gibbering Abomination</h1>
<p class="description">A horrifying expanse of fused faces and parts of faces, the gibbering abomination is the result of foul arcane experiments studying the creation of chimerical creatures.</p>

<h4><span id="All-around_Vision_Ex"><a name="TOC-All-around-Vision-Ex-"></a>All-around Vision (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gibbering abomination sees in all directions at once. It cannot be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking">flanked</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Amorphous_Ex"><a name="TOC-Amorphous-Ex-"></a>Amorphous (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gibbering abomination’s body is malleable and shapeless. It is immune to precision damage (like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack">sneak attacks</a>) and critical hits, and can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing.</p>
<h4><span id="Arcane_Frenzy_Ex"><a name="TOC-Arcane-Frenzy-Ex-"></a>Arcane Frenzy (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A gibbering abomination is capable of using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> more frequently than other creatures. It may use a single <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> each round as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, two <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, or four <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>; it may not choose to do more than one of these in the same round, and cannot use this ability in the same round it uses Disruptive Cacophony. When engaging in an arcane frenzy, the gibbering abomination may use the same <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like</a> ability multiple times, but may not use the same <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like</a> ability against the same target twice in one round. If more than one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> is used, the specific <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> and their targets must be determined before any effects are determined, including saves and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Blood_Drain_Ex"><a name="TOC-Blood-Drain-Ex-"></a>Blood Drain (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>On a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check after grabbing, several of the creature’s mouths attach to its target. Each round it maintains its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a>, the gibbering abomination automatically deals 3d6+12 points of bite damage and 1 point of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> as it drains its victim’s blood.</p>
<h4><span id="Deathless_Su"><a name="TOC-Deathless-Su-"></a>Deathless (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a gibbering abomination is slain, it is not truly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a>, and 1 hour later it returns to life at 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, allowing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Fast_Healing_Ex">fast healing</a> thereafter to resume healing it. A gibbering abomination can be permanently destroyed only with death magic or complete incineration of its remains (such as dumping it into a pool of magma).</p>
<h4><span id="Disruptive_Cacophony_Su"><a name="TOC-Disruptive-Cacophony-Su-"></a>Disruptive Cacophony (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a> the gibbering abomination may produce a horrible quasi-arcane chanting that is highly disruptive to nearby magic effects.</p>
<p>Any creature that can clearly hear this chanting (maximum range 100 ft.) must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration">concentration</a> check (DC 20 plus level of spell) to successfully cast a spell or use a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like</a> ability. The check DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. A gibbering abomination that uses this ability may not use any of its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like</a> abilities on its current turn, or until the start of its next turn.</p>
<h4><span id="Pain_Immunity_Ex"><a name="TOC-Pain-Immunity-Ex-"></a>Pain Immunity (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Because the gibbering abomination is already in incredible pain, it is immune to any effect or condition caused as a result of extreme pain or agony. This ability does not protect it against any physical damage it might suffer as well, however.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> forest or underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
It bears a close superficial resemblance to a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/gibbering-mouther">gibbering mouther</a> or lesser gibbering orb, and may be mistaken for one of those, but they are no true relation. Instead, the gibbering abomination has been cobbled together from the faces and organs of dozens of humanoid creatures; its innards are a bizarre tangle of brains, hearts, and other organs. The gibbering abomination is in constant pain as a result of the process that created it, haunted by half-remembered memories from the creatures it was composed from.
<p>Gibbering abominations have clear memories of the experiments and procedures they suffered in their formation, and value nothing more than their own personal freedom. Beyond that, their constant anguish has given them a hateful attitude toward other creatures.</p>

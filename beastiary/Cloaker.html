<h1>Cloaker</h1>
<p class="description">This ray-like creature opens a toothy maw and leers with glaring red eyes. Behind it whips a menacing tail of segmented bone.</p>

<h4><span id="Engulf_Ex">Engulf (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A cloaker can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its body as a standard action. The cloaker attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its attack roll. It can still use its whip-like tail to strike at other targets. Attacks that hit an engulfing cloaker deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.</p>
<h4><span id="Moan_Ex">Moan (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A cloaker can emit an infrasonic moan as a standard action, with one of four effects.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Fear</i>: All creatures in a 30-foot spread must save (Will negates) or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked" rel="nofollow">panicked</a> for 2 rounds.</li>
<li><i>Nausea</i>: All creatures in a 30-foot cone must save (Fortitude negates) or fall <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone" rel="nofollow">prone</a> and be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated" rel="nofollow">nauseated</a> for 1d4+1 rounds.</li>
<li><i>Stupor</i>: A single creature within 30 feet is affected by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hold-monster" rel="nofollow">hold monster</a> for 5 rounds (Will negates).</li>
<li><i>Unnerve</i>: Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes a â2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those in the area for more than 6 consecutive rounds must save (Will negates) or enter a trance, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless" rel="nofollow">helpless</a> until the moaning stops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mind-affecting attacks. A creature that successfully saves against the cloaker’s fear, nausea, or unnerve moans cannot be affected by that same moan effect from that cloaker for 24 hours. All of the save DCs against a cloaker’s moan are DC 15. Save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Shadow_Shift_Su">Shadow Shift (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When in dim illumination, a cloaker can manipulate shadows as a free action to create one of three effects: <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blur" rel="nofollow">blur</a> (lasts 1d4 rounds, self only), <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mirror-image" rel="nofollow">mirror image</a> (CL 6th), or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image" rel="nofollow">silent image</a> (DC 15, CL 6th, save DC is Charisma-based).</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, mob (3â6), or flock (7â12)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Resembling hideously evil flying manta rays, cloakers are mysterious and paranoid creatures. A typical specimen has an 8-foot wingspan and weighs 100 pounds.</p>

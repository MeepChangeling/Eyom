<h1>Eel, Gulper</h1>
<p class="description">This strange being of the depths appears to be little more than a large mouth, flaccid body and dangling tail which glows with an unnatural red light.</p>

<p>This larger version of its more common cousin makes its home in deep tropical and temperate waters well below 3,000 feet in depth. The gulper eel spends its life eating giant shrimp, and any other creatures which happen to arouse its senses.</p>
<p>Gulper eels spend most of their lives in the deepest and darkest parts of the oceans, rarely if ever venturing near the surface waters. Solitary creatures by nature, during mating season (colder months of the year), it is common to find a pair of these creatures dwelling together. During mating season, the female deposits her eggs (2â8) in the dirt and mass of plants on the ocean floor. Within two months the eggs hatch and the young swim free. Young are independent within 2 weeks after birth and venture out on their own shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>A gulper eel averages 10 feet in length but can grow to reach 30 feet or more. Its body is long, sleek, and black in color and its tail ends in a luminous organ. Its eyes are small for its body and close to its snout. It massive mouth is lined with rows of sharpened teeth.</p>
<p>Gulper eels attempt to bite their prey, holding it before swallowing it whole. Because a gulper eel can unhinge its jaw and stretch its stomach, it can swallow opponents larger than itself.</p>

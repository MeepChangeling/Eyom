<p>Because of its large, fur-covered paws, the snow leopard suffers no penalties for moving through snow-covered terrain. </p>

<p>Snow leopards are relatives of the common <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cat/leopard">leopard</a> and are found in the coldest regions of the world, inhabiting mountain ranges and snowy coniferous forests. Their lairs are typically rocky shelters lined with their own fur for warmth.</p>
<p>Snow leopards are strong, agile, nocturnal hunters and their diet consists of livestock, wild <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/boar/boar">boars</a>, hares, and deer. Like most other big <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/felines/cat">cats</a>, they stalk and ambush their prey. Slain prey is dragged back to the lair and devoured over a period of several days.</p>
<p>Snow leopards are generally solitary creatures, though during mating season more than one can be encountered. A den typically contains 1d2 adults and 1d4 cubs. Cubs that are captured can be sold on the market for 500 gp or more.</p>
<p>A snow leopards is about five feet long with light gray or smoke gray fur that turns white on its underbelly. Its fur is covered with large rings that contain smaller and darker spots of dark gray or black. Its fur is over one inch thick and provides it with warmth against the harshest of temperatures. Eyes are gray or dark blue. Its paws are large and thick-furred which enables it to maintain its footing on the most treacherous of snow-covered ground.</p>
<p>Snow leopards are hunted by many races for their fur which can be sold to furriers and made into coats, blankets, and so on. A typical maleâs coat fetches about 800 gp on the market.</p>
<p>Snow leopards, unlike other great <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/felines/cat">cats</a>, do not roar. Rather they let out a low, soft moan. They attack from a distance leaping or pouncing on a foe and attacking with their claws and bite.</p>

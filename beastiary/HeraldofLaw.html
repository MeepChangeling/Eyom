<h1>Herald of Law</h1>
<p class="description">The titanic golden statue of a great knight looms here, four times taller than even the most intimidating warrior. Bearing a gigantic hammer almost too large for it to hold, the sculpture depicts thick, rigid <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, but no details beneath, hiding the identity of the wearer. Upon its breast gleams a golden relief of runes, a key, and a shining city.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Lawgiver is a cautious opponent and, if given time, takes several moments to judge the battlefield before entering combat. In most cases, it prefers to let battle come to it, using its freeze ability to appear as nothing more than a giant statue, then coming to devastating life once his lordâs enemies surround it.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Lawgiver pounds a single opponent until dead before moving onto another enemy. If possible, it pursues its foes, using its wings to mete out judgment wherever the foes of law might flee.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Lawgiver fights until its master commands it to retreat or it is destroyed. Even if killed, though, the herald reappears at his lordâs side 1 day later.</p>

<p>Lawgiver is aware of everything around it at all times, providing it with a +4 racial bonus on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> checks. The Herald cannot be flanked.</p>
<h4><span id="Freeze_Ex"><a name="TOC-Freeze-Ex-"></a>Freeze (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Lawgiver can hold itself so still it appears to be a gigantic, golden statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> check to notice the Herald is really alive.</p>
<h4><span id="Golden_Body_Ex"><a name="TOC-Golden-Body-Ex-"></a>Golden Body (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Lawgiver is a creature of living gold and blessed steel, granting it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to acid, electricity, critical hits, and rusting effects (such as the <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/rusting-grasp"><i>rusting grasp</i></a> </i>spell or a rust monsterâs rust attack).</p>

<p>Lawgiver can be summoned by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">clerics</a> of a deity of law using the spell <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate"><i>gate</i></a> </i>or <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/planar-ally"><i>greater planar ally</i></a>, </i>despite any restrictions of those spells.</p>
<h4><span id="Wings_of_Law_Su"><a name="TOC-Wings-of-Law-Su-"></a>Wings of Law (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a free action, Lawgiver can manifest a pair of gigantic golden wings. These wings grant the herald a flight speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. The Herald can dismiss its wings at will. Alternatively, as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, the Herald can take the form a two-headed golden eagle, one of his lordâs many symbols. The Herald retains its normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> and bonus to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> in this form, but otherwise has the same statistics and abilities of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/eagle">eagle</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> Solitary<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard (Gargantuan +1 <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/axiomatic">axiomatic</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/warhammer">warhammer</a>)</p>
<p>Terse in nature, Lawgiver restricts communication to an unusual limit. Although the giant can speak several languages, it has only ever been heard speaking in numbers and measurements orâmore frequentlyâin direct quotes from holy writings<i>.</i> Encyclopedic in its knowledge of holy texts, this restriction rarely prevents Lawgiver from making its intentions known.</p>

<p>The Herald goes where powerful worshipers of God of Law call him and where the god of cities and law orders. While a literal giant on the battlefield, often the mere suggestion of the Heraldâs prowess or his lordâs displeasure is enough to avert a disruptive conflict completely. History relates a widely debated episode involving a mysterious golden statue that numerous modern theologians identify as the herald of God of Law.</p>
<p>On several occasions, followers of the god of law have reported seeing the Herald wandering remote places, from ancient caves to deep underwater trenches, seemingly searching for something. Neither God of Law nor the golden titan ever speak of these travels, leading to widespread conjecture and debate among the faith.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Spit-Acid-Ex-"></a><b>Spit Acid (Ex)</b><br/> </h4> A giant slug can spit acid at an opponent within 60 feet (no range increment). With a successful ranged touch attack, the target takes 10d6 points of acid damage (no save).
<br/>
<h4><a name="TOC-Malleable-Ex-"></a><b>Malleable (Ex)</b><br/> </h4> A giant slug’s body is very malleable, allowing it to fit into narrow areas with ease. A giant slug takes no penalty to its speed or checks when squeezing in an area that is one size category smaller than its actual size (10 feet wide for most giant slugs). A giant slug can squeeze normally through an area two size categories smaller than its actual size (5 feet wide for most giant slugs).
<br/>
<h4><a name="TOC-Susceptible-to-Salt-Ex-"></a><b>Susceptible to Salt (Ex)</b><br/> </h4> A handful of salt burns a giant slug as if it were a flask of acid, causing 1d6 points of damage per use.

<p><span>No simple garden pests, giant slugs pose a serious threat to those caught in their path. Folk who dwell near swamps and other regions that support giant slugs risk losing livestock and even their homes to these enormous beasts. Giant slugs constantly wander in search of food, their preference being fleshy organic material, which they slice into smaller, easily gulped chunks with their rasp-like tongues.</span></p>
<p><span>What strange influence might have caused the first giant slugs to grow to such monstrous proportions is unknown, but today, giant slugs breed true and birth their oversized offspring after a fleshy, squirming courtship ritual. After mating, a female giant slug lays just over a hundred eggs, each approximately a foot in diameter. The mother slug guards this clutch fiercely and aggressively attacks any creatures that wander too close. Giant slugs inhabiting swamps aboveground mate once a year, and those who live in the area know better than to go into the swamps during this month.</span></p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Lockjaw-Ex-"></a><b>Lockjaw (Ex)<br/></b> </h4> The Bulldogâs jaw muscles are extremely strong and once it locks on to something it is very hard to get it to let go. The Bulldog can attempt to grab its opponent on a successful bite attack.

<p><span>The Bulldog is smaller mastiff-like breed that is bred primarily as a guard/war dog or as a working dog. Many unscrupulous sorts also breed and train them for pit-fighting, bull-baiting and gladiatorial combat. In fact, it is from the blood sport of bull-baiting that the breed gets its name.<br/>A typical Bulldog stands about two feet at the shoulders and weighs around 45 pounds. They can have reddish-brown, brown or white fur, sometimes with splotches of two of these colors.</span></p>

<p>If a Blonde Mastiff is fighting in direct defense of its master or its masterâs family or property, the Blonde Mastiff will continue fighting even if its hit points fall below 0. The mastiff is staggered and loses 1 hp each round, and finally dies once its hit points reach a negative total equal to its Constitution score.</p>
<b>Carrying Capacity</b>: A light load for a Blonde Mastiff is up to 99 pounds; a medium load, 100-200 pounds; a heavy load, 201-300 pounds. A Blonde Mastiff can drag 1,500 pounds.

<p><span>The Blonde Mastiff is a massive guard dog that is today bred primarily by nobles and merchants. The average specimen stands nearly three feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 200 pounds, though some large males have been known to reach 250 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span>These impressive and loyal dogs generally have yellowish, golden, or blonde coats, though silver sometimes occurs. Their heads are typical for a mastiff â compact and powerful, with short, blunt muzzles, high foreheads, and drooping ears. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>This breed is an excellent guard dog, guarding both home and flock loyally. Blonde Mastiffs will fight to the death to defend their master.</span></p>

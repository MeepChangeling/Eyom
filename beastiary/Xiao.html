<p>Xiaos are omnivores, eating fruit, nuts, insects, small mammals, crabs, and fish. Given enough time, rather than devouring their food raw, xiaos create elaborate dishes of their favorite foods and cook these dishes over small fires, which they light with their spark <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>. Xiaos also enjoy trying new and exotic foods prepared by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> creatures, especially foods made with flour and sugar. Most xiaos are very adventurous eaters, though they tend not to like the taste of beef and lamb.</p>
<p>Xiaos build nests high up in the canopy of wild places or thick forests, and often cluster their nests together in groups of trees. They welcome small villages of friendly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> within their territories, as such creatures are a ready source of useful objects and new forms of interesting food. Xiao troops often raid nearby civilized communities for small amounts of salt and sugar, or prepared foods for single meals, but do not otherwise cause much mischief unless provoked. Larger or hostile communities that persecute or hunt xiaos often suffer from numerous unexpected fires and destructive forms of larceny and sabotage.</p>
<p>Xiaos have excellent memories and hold grudges against those who abuse them.</p>
<p>While xiaos have very few natural enemies, they flee from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/derhii">derhii</a> on sight. The enormous winged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/primates/primate-gorilla">gorillas</a> are very territorial and consider xiaos to be pests. They do not hesitate to kill, skin, and eat xiaos, and can eliminate a thriving xiao community in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Xiaos are born from eggs slightly larger than a chicken egg. These eggs are covered with bluish leathery skin, and are usually laid singly or, infrequently, in pairs. A juvenile xiao begins flying within 6 weeks of hatching, and hangs from the fur on its mother’s chest until that time. Those born in captivity latch on to suitably friendly and patient <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> as surrogate mothers during development. While a xiao raised in captivity takes to flying later than those born in the wild, it otherwise develops normally, though it is likely to have less fear of strange <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">humans</a> than its wild kin.</p>

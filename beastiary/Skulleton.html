<p>Skulletons are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> creatures believed to have been created by a lich or demilich, for the creature greatly resembles the latter in that it is nothing more than a pile of dust, a skull, and a collection of bones. The gemstones inset in its eye sockets and in place of its teeth are not gemstones at all, but painted glass (worthless). The skulleton is thought to have been created to frighten off would-be tomb plunderers, or convince them they have defeated the skulleton’s creator rather than a minor servitor and tomb guardian.</p>
<p>A skulleton lies in wait for its prey. When a living creature touches a skulleton, it uses its dust attack to incapacitate and confuse the intruders. Then it rises in the air, pivoting to face its prey and glowering in a display of fearsome presence, using its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/dazzling-display-combat">Dazzling Display</a> feat as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> to attempt to demoralize those near it. If the intruders have not fled, it moves in to bite with its gem-encrusted teeth.</p>

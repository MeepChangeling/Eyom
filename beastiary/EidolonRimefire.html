<h4><span id="Ice_Glide_Su">Ice Glide (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A rimefire eidolon can use its burrow speed to move through ice without penalty, as easily as a fish swims through water. It leaves no tunnel or trace of its passage.</p>
<h4><span id="Ice_Shape_Sp">Ice Shape (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>This spell functions as <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-shape">stone shape</a>, except that it shapes ice instead. This is the equivalent of a 4th level spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Mystic_Bond_Su">Mystic Bond (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A rimefire eidolon can forge a mystic link with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> by taking one minute. This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> must be within one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> of chaotic good. When so linked, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon">eidolon</a> and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> can both detect each otherâs health, as per a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/status">status</a> spell, and both gain a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Sacred-Bonus">sacred bonus</a> to saves against death effects. This effect is permanent until either partner leaves the plane, or chooses to sever the bond as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Rimefire_Bolt_Su">Rimefire Bolt (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a rimefire eidolon can fire a bolt of energy at a range of 120 feet as a ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>. This deals 2d6 points of damage plus its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier, half of which is cold and half of which is fire. They can make iterative attacks with this ability.</p>
<h4><span id="Rimefire_Spell_Su">Rimefire Spell (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day, a rimefire eidolon can change one of its spells that deals cold damage to deal rimefire damage instead. It deals half fire and half cold damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Steer_Ward_Su">Steer Ward (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a rimefire eidolon is merged with its ward, it may move the iceberg up to 30 feet as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>.</p>
<p>This creature appears as a jagged chunk of ice the size of a human torso, blazing with blue fire. It walks along thin annulated tendrils.</p>
<p>In combat, rimefire eidolons make use of their abilities to drift through ice and make hit and run attacks. They are relatively weak melee combatants, but can fire powerful beams of rimefire from their bodies. Their cold spells deal rimefire damage as well, allowing them to injure beings of cold such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/giant-frost">frost giants</a>. Rimefire eidolons prefer to disable foes than kill them, unless they are irredeemable creatures such as evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>.</p>
<p>Rimefire eidolons are creative spirits, and their icebergs are frequently in unusual shapes or colors due to their ability to shape ice. They encourage animals to live in and on their icebergs, but do not make value judgements about predators and prey. As the remnants of a slain goddess, they have a strong sense of mortality and a grim sense of humor. Their attitude is that they should be proactive in order to prevent others from suffering the same fate that met their progenitor.</p>
<p>A rimefire eidolonâs primary body is four feet in diameter, and their tendrils can extend to four feet in length. They can use their tendrils as feet, as well as to manipulate objects as well as a human can use their hands.</p>
<h3><span id="Rimefire_Ice">Rimefire Ice</span></h3>
<p>Rimefire ice is a strange supernatural phenomenon that combines both heat and cold. Rimefire ice is cold to the touchâmerely making contact with it deals 1 point of cold damage a round. However, it does not melt at room temperature, and when exposed to high heat, burns as wood does, except that the burning deals half cold damage and half fire damage. Rimefire eidolons often have patches of rimefire ice within their icebergs.</p>

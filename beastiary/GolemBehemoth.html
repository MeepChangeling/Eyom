<h4><span id="Castle_Ex"><a name="TOC-Castle-Ex-"></a>Castle (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A behemoth golem has a small stronghold built onto its back. Up to eight Medium creatures can occupy this tower by climbing onto the behemoth golem with a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb">Climb</a> check (DC 10 if the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> is willing). A creature occupying the tower can choose either to hide in the castle’s interior, gaining total <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> as long as it remains within the structure but losing the ability to attack anything outside of the tower, or to stand on the parapet around the perimeter of the tower, gaining partial <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover">cover</a> thanks to the battlement surrounding the walkway. A behemoth golem’s castle moves with the creature itself, and though creatures occupying the castle count as occupying the same square as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a>, they cannot be engaged in melee unless their opponent is also occupying the castle.</p>
<p>A behemoth golem can shake off unwanted occupants by making a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>; any creatures currently occupying the castle must succeed at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save (DC equal to the result of the behemoth golem’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check). Creatures standing on the parapet that fail their save fall out of the castle, landing in the nearest empty square and taking 5d6 points of falling damage (6d6 if standing on the uppermost parapet); creatures hiding within the castle that fail their saves are jumbled about and take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC for half damage).</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Su"><a name="TOC-Immunity-to-Magic-Su-"></a>Immunity to Magic (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A behemoth golem is immune to any spell or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> that allows <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-to-flesh">stone to flesh</a> spell negates a behemoth golem’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> for 1 round.</li>
<li>A <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transmute-rock-to-mud">transmute rock to mud</a> spell slows a behemoth golem as the slow spell for 1d4 rounds (no save).</li>
<li>A magical attack that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it gains any excess as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>. A behemoth golem gets no save against acid effects.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Quake_Su"><a name="TOC-Quake-Su-"></a>Quake (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> once per day, a behemoth golem can stomp its two front feet down, creating a ripple of destruction in a 60-foot cone. This effect is otherwise identical to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/earthquake">earthquake</a> (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> 17th).</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate and warm deserts<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Behemoth golems are elephantine constructs.</p>
<p>Rather than use elemental spirits to fuel the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>‘ animation, artificers made pacts with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil">devils</a> from the evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Outer-Planes">Outer Planes</a>, and bound their spirits to these titanic horrors to bring them to life. Though from a distance they resemble armored mammoths with a castle attached to their back, a behemoth golem’s flesh is in fact made of tons of mined stone, and its tusks and teeth are carved from rare minerals similar in density to ivory.</p>
<p>The main body of a behemoth golem is 40 feet tall, with the highest part of the tower reaching 60 feet.</p>
<h3><span id="Construction">Construction</span></h3>
<p>While the methods for creating a behemoth golem are largely considered lost, a character who finds herself in possession of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/book-behemoth-golem-manual">behemoth golem manual</a> gains the knowledge required to construct such a mammoth being. A behemoth golem is built from 70,000 pounds of rocks and rare minerals treated with profane oils worth 25,000 gp.</p>

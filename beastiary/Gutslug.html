<h1>Gutslug</h1>
<p class="description">This slimy, sticky, worm bears a striking resemblance to humanoid entrails. Its lengthy body looks like a lumpy, veined, gray tube approximately 10 feet long, but no thicker than a sword handle. It has no eyes, and its large, round mouth resembles the suckered mouth of a leech.</p>

<p>These hideous creatures have many namesâentrail worms, intestine crawlers, viscera worms, and several others. The most common name assigned to these leech-like parasites is gutslug.</p>
<p>Gutslugs are most often found in underground caverns, though some do lair above ground. Aboveground gutslugs build their nests in forested areas, often near lakes or rivers. They are never encountered in warm or cold regions as they detest both extremes. They are nocturnal hunters and generally avoid the sunlight if possible. (Sunlight does not damage them, they just donât like it.) Subterranean gutslugs nest in crevasses, or in small caves or natural caverns, sometimes near a source of water. The lair is coated with a thick layer of slimy and sticky mucus (regurgitated by the gutslug). This mucus has a strong acidic stench and is easily detected at ranges of 30 feet or less. At irregular intervals (especially after feeding), the body of a gutslug widens to accommodate a bag-like stomach.</p>
<p>When a warm-blooded living creature is detected, a gutslug flies or crawls directly toward it, attacking and biting almost mindlessly.</p>

<h1>Breathless One</h1>
<p class="description">This ash-gray figure has an oversized mouth and a concave chest. It clenches its fists and gasps for air as black tendrils composed of necrotized lung tissue erupt from its chest.</p>

<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su">Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> creature killed by a breathless one’s kiss of death or steal air becomes a breathless one under the control of its killer. A creature killed by kiss of death returns 1d4 rounds later, while a creature killed by steal air returns 24 hours later.</p>
<h4><span id="Kiss_of_Death_Ex">Kiss of Death (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If a breathless one succeeds at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check against an adjacent opponent, it clamps its mouth over the opponent’s nose and mouth to suffocate it.</p>
<p>Each round the breathless one maintains a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> and its target fails a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save its condition worsens: it becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round, it falls <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a> and is reduced to 0 hp, it drops to -1 hp and is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying">dying</a>, it dies. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Steal_Air_Ex">Steal Air (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When a breathless one succeeds at a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> attempt with a tentacle, its target must succeed at a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> and 1d2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Str</a> damage. If the target takes damage, the breathless heals 1d8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. Hit points healed in excess of its maximum are gained as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> to a maximum amount equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> score.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> last for 1 minute. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the breathless one can attempt to dispel a spell or effect (as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>) that provides the target breathable air. The breathless one uses its HD as its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> when making this attempt.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> creatures suffocate, the horror of slowly dying from lack of air drives them mad and they sometimes return as breathless ones. These vengeful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> seek to inflict the same horror on the living while filling their lungs with air as a brief respite from their eternal torment. Breathless ones weigh the same as they did in life, even though their caved-in chests give them the appearance of weighing less.</p>
<p>Since the most common place for death by suffocation is locations with thin or no atmosphere, such as the void of space, breathless ones most commonly appear there. They hide among asteroids or constructed places they can tether themselves, since they have no ability to fly through space. They prefer to attack from hiding, but they also enjoy the terror their visages induce in their victims. Breathless ones use their necrotic lung fibers to puncture their victims’ lungs, latch onto them, and reel them in for their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/deadly" style="font-style: italic;">deadly</a> embrace. They do this rather than attack from up close to soften up their victims, bolster themselves, and enjoy witnessing their victims’ terror at the inexorable fate. They reserve the kill for their kiss of death, since that gives them the rush of air to alleviate their suffering, if only temporarily.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair or vacuum (3-6)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Groups of breathless ones on an inhabited asteroid sabotage or steal equipment necessary to provide air to the inhabitants. They are not subtle about it, however, so it is easy to see smashed helmets or air bladders. They often purposely make enough noise to rouse defenders and escape into an airless environment with their gains in full view of their victims, enticing their victims to chase them to recover vital equipment. With the speed at which breathless ones spawn, a handful can wipe out even a well-fortified installation.</p>

<p>Created to guard the tombs of the honored dead, mummies are ever vigilant for those who would desecrate their sacred ground.</p>
<p>Mummies are created through a rather lengthy and gruesome embalming process, during which all of the body’s major organs are removed and replaced with dried herbs and flowers. After this process, the flesh is anointed with sacred oils and wrapped in purified linens. The creator then finishes the ritual with a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-undead">create undead</a> spell.</p>
<p>Although most mummies are created merely as guardians and remain loyal to their charge until their destruction, certain powerful mummies have much more free will. The majority are at least 10th-level clerics, and are often kings or pharaohs who have called upon dark gods or sinister necromancers to bind their souls to their bodies after deathâusually as a means to extend their rule beyond the grave, but at times simply to escape what they fear will be an eternity of torment in their own afterlife.</p>
<h3><span id="Variant_Mummies"><a name="TOC-Variant-Mummies"></a>Variant Mummies</span></h3>
<p>Not every preserved and animated corpse is a linen-wrapped tomb guardian. Some cultures preserve their dead in different ways, and the following suggestions can help GMs represent these variant mummies.</p>
<p><b>Bog Mummy</b>: A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy/bog-mummy-paizo">bog mummy’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-">DR</a> changes to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-">DR</a> 10/ slashing and is vulnerable to cold instead of fire. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy/bog-mummy-paizo">bog mummy</a> causes grave ichor with its slam instead of mummy rot.</p>
<p><b>Ice Mummy</b>: An ice mummy, sometimes called a mountain mummy or a glacial mummy, lacks a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> normal despair and mummy rot abilities, and instead gains the chilling touch and entangling wrappings variant mummy special abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lesser</b>: A lesser spellscribed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> bears a single 1st or 2nd-level spell in its wrappings, usable once per day with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> equal to half its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. Its CR does not increase.</li>
<li><b>Greater</b>: A greater spellscribed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> operates as a normal spellscribed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a>, but its wrappings can hold as many spells as it has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. The total spell levels scribed cannot exceed twice its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>, and the spells must be of a level no higher than half its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. Spells cannot be repeated, but spells of a level no higher than one-quarter the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> hit dice can be used 3 times per day instead of 1. (For example, a standard greater spellscribed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> with 8 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> can have up to 8 different spells, of no higher than 4th level, and a total of not more than 16 spell levels. It can use spells of 2nd level or lower 3 times per day, and spells of higher levels once per day.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a greater spellscribed mummy has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a> equal to its adjusted CR + 11.</p>
<p>A greater spellscribed mummy’s CR is 2 higher than that of a normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a>.</p>
<p><b>Tomb Guardian</b>: A tomb guardian is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> that lacks the typical despair and mummy rot abilities, and instead has the infested variant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> special ability.</p>
<h3><span id="Variant_Mummy_Special_Abilities"><a name="TOC-Variant-Mummy-Special-Abilities"></a>Variant Mummy Special Abilities</span></h3>
<p>The abilities of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> reflect the circumstances of its creation. Mummies that arise from traditionally embalmed corpses usually exhibit standard abilities; those arising from natural <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-discoveries/mummification-ex">mummification</a> or more exotic embalming rituals may not.</p>
<p>Several variant mummy abilities replace a mummy’s basic despair or mummy rot abilities, as described in the ability, and do not alter its CR. Exceptional mummies may gain additional abilities instead of having their powers replaced. GMs modifying mummies with additional or variant abilities should check the final monster and adjust the CR appropriately.</p>
<p>These abilities can also be applied to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> with the mummified creature template.</p>
<p>For purposes of variant abilities, any ability that replaces despair can replace burst of vengeance, and any ability that replaces mummy rot can replace dust stroke. Optionally, to create a mummified creature with the same special abilities as a traditional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a>, simply replace the mummified creature’s burst of vengeance with despair, or replace its dust stroke with mummy rot.</p>
<p>Many variant abilities are described in terms of a standard, linen-wrapped mummy. Adjust the description appropriately for mummies with different origins. For example, an ice mummy grapples and constricts its victims by chilling them to the bone with waves of cold instead of by wrapping them in linen strips (as presented in the entangling wrappings ability).</p>
<h4><span id="Chilling_Touch_Su"><a name="TOC-Chilling-Touch-Su-"></a>Chilling Touch (Su)</span></h4>
<p>This <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> touch carries the chill of glaciers and mountain heights. Its slam attack deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage, and creatures struck by it are slowed for 1d4 rounds (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> negates). The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> + the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier. This ability replaces mummy rot.</p>
<h4><span id="Entangling_Wrappings_Su"><a name="TOC-Entangling-Wrappings-Su-"></a>Entangling Wrappings (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> with entangling wrappings can unravel and detach some of its linen strips to make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check against a creature up to 10 feet away (or twice the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> reach for larger mummies). This attack doesn’t provoke an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>. It can <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a> for an amount of damage equal to its slam attack with a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. The linen strips remain wrapped around the victim and attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pin</a> each round on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> turn. They continue to deal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a> damage on a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. The wrappings cannot be damaged by any attack or effect while detached, but turn to dust if their victim escapes or dies, or if the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> is destroyed. If the mummy still lives, its wrappings reappear at the end of its next turn.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> is not inconvenienced in any way while its wrappings are detached and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a>, but it cannot use its wrappings to entangle again until they return. This ability replaces either despair or mummy rot.</p>
<h4><span id="Infested_Ex"><a name="TOC-Infested-Ex-"></a>Infested (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An infested mummy carries a scarab <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> inside its body cavity. The mummy can release its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, or it can do so as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a> after taking damage from a slashing weapon. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> is completely under the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> control, and can’t be harmed while inside the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a>, though it streams out of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> body if the mummy is destroyed. If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> is destroyed, a new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> grows to replace it in 24 hours. For variation, instead of carrying a scarab swarm, an infested <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a> can hold any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> of CR 3 or lower. An infested <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> CR is 1 higher than that of a normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy</a>, or this ability can replace despair and mummy rot and not affect the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/mummy">mummy’s</a> final CR.</p>

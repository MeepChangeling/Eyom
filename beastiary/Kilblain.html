<h4><span id="Breath_Weapon_Su">Breath Weapon (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature that takes damage from a kilblainâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a> must succeed a DC 29 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Frostbite_Aura_Su">Frostbite Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>All creatures within a 30 foot radius of a kilblain must succeed a DC 26 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save every round or take 4d6 points of cold damage. A living creature that takes this damage is treated as having <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/frostbite">frostbite</a>âit is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued">fatigued</a> until all of the damage it has taken from cold has been healed.</p>
<h4><span id="Frozen_Stare_Su">Frozen Stare (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> three times per day, a kilblain can focus its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> on a creature within 30 feet to turn it into ice. A creature affected must succeed a DC 26 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified">petrified</a>, as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/flesh-to-stone">flesh to stone</a>, except that the sculpture has <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 0 and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-">vulnerability</a> to fire. A creature with the fire subtype that fails its save instead takes 180 points of damage, as per a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/finger-of-death">finger of death</a> spell, and still takes 3d6+18 points of damage on a successful save. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Ice_Jets_Ex">Ice Jets (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A kilblain can fly at a rate of 80 feet with perfect maneuverability, but cannot make claw attacks in the same round it uses its fly speed.</p>
<h4><span id="Protection_from_Fire_Creatures_Sp">Protection from Fire Creatures (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>Treat this as a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/protection-from-evil">protection from evil</a> effect, except that the bonuses are against creatures with the fire subtype instead of an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> subtype. This is the equivalent of a 1st level spell.</p>
<p>This creature resembles an insane combination of insects and arachnids sculpted out of ice. It scuttles on four legs; four more are held aloft like the arms of a mantis. Its head is tucked within armored plates with a jagged, vertical maw, and its tail ends in a bony club like that of a dinosaur. Frills, spines and ridges decorate its vaguely oval carapace. It radiates cold as a palpable presence.</p>
<p>Kilblains are monstrous creatures that despise elemental fire. They hunt down and kill fire creatures regardless of size, power or alignment, wiping them from the face of the planet. A kilblain typically makes its lair on snowy peaks and strikes out to hunt. Their lairs are caves and caverns, carved by claw if natural caves are unavailable. The joy of murdering <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/azer">azers</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/salamander">salamanders</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/giant-fire">fire giants</a>, and even gold or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/chromatic-red">red dragons</a> directs their behavior more than food, mating or other basic needs. They collect treasure from these raids, and their dens typically possess trophy halls organized by theme or difficulty of their opponents.</p>
<p>A kilblain is capable of flight despite their ungainly appearance. In order to fly, they retract their eight limbs into their shell and fly on jets of frozen airâthis grants them incredible speed and maneuverability, but they cannot attack with their scissoring claws while doing so. They typically focus their energy on creatures with the fire subtype first, but even spellcasters using fire spells or persons carrying torches can be promoted to their primary target. A kilblain is bold in combat to the point of self-destruction. Once blood has been spilled, they usually fight to the death.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold mountains and hills<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/><b>Treasure</b> double standard</p>

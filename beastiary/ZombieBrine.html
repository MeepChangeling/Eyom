<h1>Zombie, Brine</h1>
<p class="description">This creature appears as a rotting humanoid dressed in tattered and ragged clothing. Its semi-bloated body glistens from the slimy mixture of water and seaweed that hangs from its form. The creature’s rotting flesh is blue-green in color. No semblance of life burns in its eyes. </p>

<p>Brine zombies are the remnants of a ship’s crew that has perished at sea. They are mindless creatures, not very pleasant to look at, and relentless in their attacks on the living. The spark of evil that brought them back from the ocean depths drives them to seek the living so they may join them in their watery graves. Brine zombies appear much as they did in life.</p>

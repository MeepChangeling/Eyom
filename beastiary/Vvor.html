<h1>Vvor</h1>
<p class="title">Vvor <span class="level">CR 3</span></p>
<p class="description">Though you are far underground, this four-legged beast resembles the boars that roam above, though with a few important differences. Large spikes jut out of the beastâs back, and its tusks look far deadlier than their surface-dwelling counterparts.</p>

<h4><span id="Spirited_Charge_Ex">Spirited Charge (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>If a vvor can charge its full movement speed (40 feet), it gains a +2 to attack and deals double damage with its gore.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground<br/><b>Organization</b> pair or group (2â30)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Immature males hunt in packs of 10 to 15 led by the largest immature male (called âbig brotherâ), and are capable of bringing down adult bears.</p>
<p>The pack quietly surrounds their target and big brother leads the charge by lowering his head and rushing the creature, ripping upward with the horns on his head. Big brother retreats from the prey and then the other males begin attacking from different sides, moving in, slashing with their horns, and then retreating. This continues until the prey has fallen, or (rarely) fought its way free.</p>
<p>The largest, most violent male rules vvor groups, known as families. When male vvors reach maturity, they either challenge the bull male or they leave the family. If a vvor is found on its own, it is usually a male that is looking for somewhere to start his own family. Bull vvors have been measured as much as seven feet long and weighing close to half a ton. The average bull is closer to five feet long and weighs between 600 and 700 pounds, and the typical cow vvor is three to four feet long, weighing 300 to 400 pounds.</p>
<p>Immature male vvor are three feet long and weigh 150 pounds, with immature females being slightly smaller.</p>
<p>The statistics given above are for a standard immature male vvor.</p>

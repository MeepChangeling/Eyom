<h1>Alligator</h1>
<p class="description">This aggressive predator lies mostly submerged in the water, with only its eyes and nostrils showing, waiting for prey to come within reach.</p>

<p> If enraged or hungry, the alligator bellows and snaps at anyone within 5 feet of the edge of the water. The alligator has to make a DC 15 Climb check to clamber up high enough to bite at someone this close to the edge, and even then, the cover provided grants his target a +2 bonus to AC. If thereâs more than one target, roll randomly to see who the animal tries to bite. Anyone who the alligator successfully grabs is automatically pulled down into the water below unless heâs strong enough to hold his footing (the alligator weighs 500 pounds). If reduced to 7 hit points or less, the alligator retreats into the water to hide.</p>

</span></h4> <p><span>When <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grappling</a> a foe of its size or smaller, an alligator can perform a death roll upon making a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The alligator inflicts its bite damage and knocks the creature <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>.

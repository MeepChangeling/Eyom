<h1>Tintargurill</h1>
<p class="description">Six tendrils tipped with hooks made from gray bark sprout from the base of this plantâs bulbous central pod. Dozens of smaller tubers glistening with yellowish residue snake out from the podâs surface between strips of bark, with one massive stalk ending in a flytrap-like head emerging from the plantâs crown.</p>

<h4><span id="Feybane_Bark_Ex">Feybane Bark (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>All of a tintargurillâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a>, including damage from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-">swallow whole</a>, are treated as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a> for the purpose of bypassing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Sticky_Enzymes_Ex">Sticky Enzymes (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A tintargurill produces semisolid strands of enzymes with adhesive properties that it can excrete from certain tendrils. Using its sticky enzymes functions like the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/web">web</a> universal monster ability, except that creatures with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> overcome by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a> that are affected by the enzymes suffer intense pain, forcing them to succeed on a DC 19 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save each round they remain in contact with the strands or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a>.

<h4><span id="Supernatural_Digestion_Su">Supernatural Digestion (Su)</span></h4>
<p>If a tintargurill deals damage to a creature with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> overcome by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a> with its bite attack or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-">swallow whole</a> ability, it gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a> 5 for 1 round. If such a creature perishes inside the tintargurill, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-">fast healing</a> lasts for 1d6 minutes instead.</p>
<h4><span id="Woodland_Stride_Su">Woodland Stride (Su)</span></h4>
<p>This ability functions like the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid</a> ability of the same name.</p>

<p>Tintargurills are ravenous plants that feed mainly on fey flesh. They lurk in the undergrowth of fey-infested wilds, where they stake out large territories with sheets of their adhesive enzymes and wait for unsuspecting fey to stumble into their domain. Several woodcutters have tried to tame the plants to use as living weapons against hostile fey, but tintargurills have proven just as aggressive toward humanoids as they are toward their favored prey, making all such efforts to date unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Although tintargurills have thus far proven undomesticable, those skilled enough to slay one can harvest its bark to create weapons well suited for killing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>. If a creature succeeds on a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> (carpentry or weaponsmithing), <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature), <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession">Profession</a> (woodcutter), or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> check, it can salvage 2d6 Medium masterwork simple wooden weapons (including clubs, javelins, quarterstaves, and spears) from the corpse of a tintargurill that died within 24 hours. These weapons function like <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a> in all respects. Double the number for Small weapons and halve the number for Large weapons.</p>
<p>Tintargurillsâ usual habitats make fey their most common source of food, but certain displaced specimens develop a taste for demon flesh. These monstrous plants gradually adapt until they can subsist on demon meat, sometimes taking on fiendish aspects of their prey to better blend into Abyssal surroundings.</p>

<h1>Pale Stranger</h1>
<p class="description">This nearly skeletal figure wields a pistol in each hand. Its garb is dusty and weathered, and smells of old decay.</p>

<h4><span id="Pistols_Su"><a name="TOC-Pistols-Su-"></a>Pistols (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A pale stranger fights with two pistols. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/pistol">pistol</a> has a range increment of 20 feet and deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage. At a range of up to 20 feet, a pale stranger’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/pistol">pistol</a> attacks resolve as touch attacks. While pistols normally consume bullets and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/ammunition/black-powder">black powder</a> when fired, a pale stranger’s pistols supernaturally reload the instant it fires them, allowing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> to make multiple attacks in a round with the weapons. In addition, any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/pistol">pistol</a> a pale stranger wields functions as a +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/pistol">pistol</a>. A pale stranger does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> when it fires a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/pistol">pistol</a> in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons for the purposes of determining penalties from two-weapon fighting. Further rules for pistols, and firearms in general, can be found in Ultimate Combat.</p>
<h4><span id="Stranger8217s_Luck_Su"><a name="TOC-Stranger-s-Luck-Su-"></a>Stranger’s Luck (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A pale stranger gains a +3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Luck-Bonus">luck bonus</a> to AC and has no chance of misfire when using firearms.</p>
<h4><span id="Stranger8217s_Shot_Ex"><a name="TOC-Stranger-s-Shot-Ex-"></a>Stranger’s Shot (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a pale stranger can take careful aim with one of its firearms and take a single, ruinous shot. This single shot always resolves as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, regardless of the actual range. If the pale stranger threatens a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> with this shot, it automatically confirms the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a>. Regardless of whether the shot is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> or not, it deals +6d6 points of damage.</p>

<p>Sometimes death itself cannot come between a gunslinger and its final revenge. When a gunslinger is slain by a hated enemy, or murdered before it can achieve vengeance against a hated foe, the anger and wrath can animate its remains as a vengeful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> monstrosity. When a pale stranger first rises, it seeks out the source of its anger to finish the jobâthereafter, it wanders the desolate parts of the world looking for new victims to vent its unending rage upon.</p>
<p>A pale stranger appears much as it did in life, though desiccated and obviously <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>. Rare pale strangers have the ability to hide their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> nature and appear as they did in life using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/veil">veil</a> as a constant <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> (CL equals their CR). These pale strangers are often more powerful and have class levels in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger">gunslinger</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">ranger</a>, and often attract large groups of adoring bandits and followers who may or may not realize that their murderous idol is in fact an unliving horror.</p>
<p>A pale stranger stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.</p>

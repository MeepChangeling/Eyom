<p>A killmoulis is thought to be distantly related to brownies and other small, helpful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a>, though it bears little physical likeness to its kin. Standing about 1 foot tall, they do not speak except through a limited form of telepathy. The race appears to be sexless. A killmoulis gang always tries to take up residence in places of human habitation where foodstuffs are prepared or handled, dwelling beneath floorboards or in garrets or behind pantry shelves. The killmoulis has the same loyalty to its host family and eagerness to perform chores as the brownie, but unlike the brownie they are more prone to pointless but harmless mischief.</p>
<p>Killmoulises are inoffensive creatures, lacking any real combat capability. They do carry dagger-like needles, however, and use these to stab and pierce their opponents. Occasionally, these needles are poisoned (with whatever <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison">poison</a> is readily available).</p>

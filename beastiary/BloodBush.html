<h4><span id="Flower_Dart_Ex"><a name="TOC-Flower-Dart-Ex-"></a>Flower Dart (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a blood bush can launch a barrage of six flower darts (make an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a> for each <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/ammunition/ammunition-thrown-darts">dart</a>). This attack has a range of 40 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only 30 such darts in one day.</p>
<h4><span id="Implant_Ex"><a name="TOC-Implant-Ex-"></a>Implant (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A creature hit by one of the blood bushâs flower darts is implanted with one of its seeds. A seed quickly germinates as follows:</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, cluster (2â4)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The blood bush is a fell plant creature cursed by a wizard in times past. It is named for its blood-red flowers and its thorny blood-red seeds. A blood bush is sometimes referred to as a âgrave marker plantâ because a creature that encounters it, and fails to see the danger this sinister plant presents, rarely lives to tell about it.</p>
<p>A blood bush can only be grown from a seed that has germinated inside the warm body of a Small or larger animal. Roots from the germinating seed kill the host and use the nutrients provided to grow rapidly into a deadly plant. A number of nobles use this horrid plant as a deterrent against thieves and robbers, sometimes creating entire hedges of these plants.</p>
<p>A blood bush appears as a flowering bush about 3 feet tall. Its thick trunk quickly splits off into many smaller, whip-like branches, each topped with a blood-red flower surrounded by deep green leaves. Blood bush seeds can be sold for about 20 gp each on the open market; collecting them and living to earn the money they bring is not the easiest of tasks.</p>
<p>When a blood bush detects a warm-blooded creature within 20 feet, it fires a volley of flower darts at the creature, attempting to implant it with its seeds. A creature that dies from the blood bushâs seed implantation rapidly decomposes, and a new blood bush springs up in the area within four days. Living creatures within 5 feet of a blood bush are slashed and cut with its four whip-like tendrils.</p>

<h1>Danse Macabre</h1>
<p class="description">Dozens of ghostly figures swirl and cavort, floating through the air as they follow the steps of an ancient, rhythmic danceâseemingly keeping time with the ebb and flow of life itself. Amid this eerie crowd of dancing specters looms a dark cloaked figure wielding a scythe, an ominous wraith with the dreaded countenance of Death itself.</p>

<h4><span id="Constitution_Drain_Su"><a name="TOC-Constitution-Drain-Su-"></a>Constitution Drain (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Living creatures hit by a danse macabreâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> scythe attack must succeed on a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or take 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Constitution drain</a>. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. On each such successful attack, the danse macabre gains 5 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Dance_of_Death_Su"><a name="TOC-Dance-of-Death-Su-"></a>Dance of Death (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A danse macabre is constantly surrounded by a 40-foot aura known as the dance of death, an endless gala of dancing spectral figures. Any living creature that enters the area of the dance of death must make a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save. On a failed Will save, the victim joins the ghostly dancers, takes 1d4 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain">Constitution drain</a>, and is affected as if by the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/irresistible-dance">irresistible dance</a>. These effects persist for as long as the victim remains within the aura. As victims cannot willingly move from the square they dance in, the danceâs effects end only when the danse macabre moves to a point where the victim is no longer within its aura, is destroyed, or if the victim is physically removed from the area. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect, and neither blindness nor deafness provide resistance. A victim who makes a successful save is immune to the dance of death of the same dance macabre for 24 hours.</p>
<p>The spectral images surrounding a dance macabre are entirely insubstantial and harmless. At the same time, a ghostly music can be faintly heard in the area, as if a violin-led orchestra kept time to this ghostly dancing. The dancers and music cannot be interacted with but visibly and audibly mark the boundaries of the danse macabreâs dance of death aura.</p>
<h4><span id="Deathless_Su"><a name="TOC-Deathless-Su-"></a>Deathless (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a manifestation of Death incarnate, a danse macabre is not itself subject to permanent destruction. If reduced to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it disappears but rejuvenates at full <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> in 1d4 days. Only by destroying the creature and then using the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hallow">hallow</a> to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/consecrate">consecrate</a> the site it manifested upon prevents the phantomâs reappearance.</p>
<h4><span id="Lifesense_Su"><a name="TOC-Lifesense-Su-"></a>Lifesense (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A danse macabre notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> ability. It also senses the strength of life forces automatically, as per the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/deathwatch">deathwatch</a>.</p>

<p>Danse macabres embody the inevitability of death. They represent the ultimate equalizer of station, revealing in their dance of death the futility of all life. In the end all mortal beings must face the fateful piper and dance to its tune.</p>
<p>Incorporeal and ominous, danse macabres typically manifest as looming, black-cloaked skeletons, although they might appear in other sinister forms depending on personifications of death unique to the cultures near where they manifest, typically a fiery pillar, a pale child, or a man in a white mask. The crowd of dancing souls that surround these 10-foot-tall specters typically do little to dispel their ominous aura.</p>
<h3><span id="Ecology"><a name="TOC-Ecology"></a>Ecology</span></h3>
<p>As undead creatures, danse macabres require nothing from their environments and contribute nothing in return. Their very presence typically suggests the murder of large numbers of creatures and, upon their horrifying manifestations, the deaths of others that happen too near.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>A danse macabre is a solitary creature that seeks only to call others to join its eternal celebration of the inevitable. They only manifest in locations tainted by untimely deathsâthe sites of countless violent executions, estates overrun by deadly plagues, or on battlefields where mass slaughters took place. The common thread is that at all of these locations hundreds, if not thousands, of victims met their fate, often in rapid succession. None claim to know what terrible death count or measurement of psychic trauma is required to spawn a danse macabre, and indeed, some of the most gore-soaked sites in Golarion have never led to one of these beingsâ manifestations. An element of grim irony or communal revenge tends to inspire such hauntings, making it impossible to predict what catastrophe or massacre might cause one to appear.</p>
<p>Some scholars of the undead suggest that danse macabre harbor no hate for the living, merely a natural drive to bring them to their final state on an accelerated schedule. Witnesses of danse macabres, however, tend to disagree, and the manifestation of a danse macabre can quickly depopulate a location through both its depredations and the flight of any survivors. Fortunately, though, these morbid shades rarely move far from the site of their initial manifestation, leading to numerous tales of haunted halls where the dead endlessly dance in their eternal revel.</p>

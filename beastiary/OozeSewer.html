<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> once per day, a sewer ooze may expel sticky sludge in a 20 foot radius centered on itself. All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of acid damage and are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save halves the damage and negates the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled">entangled</a> condition.

<p>This burbling mass of greenish-brown matter moves with a life of its own.</p>
<p>Sewer oozes are artificial creations composed of living detergents. They were first devised by an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">alchemist</a> to deal with the most stubborn stains, but have since escaped into the wild. They are instinctively attracted to filth, hence their associations with sewers. A city with a population of sewer oozes finds them a mixed blessingâalthough they do improve water quality and the smell of the streets, they occasionally eat pets and vagrants, as well as posing a hazard to any sewage workers that cross their path.</p>
<p>A sewer oozeâs body is comprised of an emulsion of different liquids, some caustic, others slick, a few sticky. They are buoyant, and typically float on the surface of the water, where they are easy to mistake for detritus. They consume all manner of organic material. A sewer ooze can live indefinitely on fecal matter dissolved in their environment, but they seek out novel flavors and attack living creatures that cross their paths. As they are slow, sewer oozes usually attack from ambush and cover enemies in sticky acids before closing into melee.</p>
<p>Despite their association with filth, sewer oozes do not smell bad; instead, they have a faint antiseptic odor. Like many oozes, they reproduce by fission.</p>

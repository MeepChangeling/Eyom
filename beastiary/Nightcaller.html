<h4><a name="TOC-Mimic-Ex-"></a>Mimic (Ex)</h4>
<p> Nightcallers may make <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff">Bluff</a> checks to imitate cries for help in either Common, Elf or Gnome. A successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff">Bluff</a> check leaves its target flat footed until the nightcallerâs next turn. Creatures that have been attacked by a nightcaller (or have had their allies attacked by a nightcaller) are immune to a nightcallerâs mimic for 24 hours. </p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests and hills<br/> <b>Organization</b> single, murder (2-9), slaughter (10-20)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p> Nightcallers are nocturnal predators who travel together. They commonly hide in forests or hills near welltraveled roads, lying in wait for a humanoid to pass by. When someone does pass, the nightcallers begin making noises that sound like a cry for help and continue to do so until their prey comes to investigate. At that point, these devious birds fly down to attack their prey. Murders and slaughters of nightcallers tend to focus on a single target and continue to attack that target until it is dead. Once he target is doomed, the nightcallers that did the most damage to the creature begin to feast on their meal while the remaining nightcallers attack a new creature. These birds are quite cowardly. It is a rare occasion for nightcallers to attack when outnumbered. Should a lone nightcaller lose half its hit points, it will fly away. When fighting in a group, they will fight until half of their kind are dead. </p>
<p> A nightcaller stands about foot tall and is covered with black feathers. Its legs are a shade of brown similar to tree bark. Their eyes are black and lifeless. </p>

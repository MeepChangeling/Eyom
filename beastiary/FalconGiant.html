<p>Giant falcons are birds of prey that build their nests high atop mountains, cliffs, or other places, inaccessible to most other creatures. They are nocturnal hunters that enjoy swooping down on unsuspecting prey, scooping it up, and flying back to their nest to dine on the meal.</p>
<p>Giant falcons prey on animals such as birds (normal and giant), reptiles, and rodents. Prized meals include <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake">snakes</a> (both normal and giant), <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/rat/dire-rat">dire rats</a>, and small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>. Prey is captured and carried to the nest, where it is devoured later or fed to the young. Mating season for giant falcons varies, but typically occurs during the summer months. The female lays 1d4+2 eggs which hatch about two months later. Within 40 days, the young falcons are fully feathered and capable of hunting. Many leave the nest for good and go out on their own.</p>
<p>A typical giant falcon stands nine feet tall and has a wingspan of up to 18 feet. Feather coloration varies, but typically ranges from brownish-red to brown. Its eyes are brown and its wings are tapered. The giant falcon has a short, slim tail consisting of brown, white, and black feathers. Most giant falcons have a light-colored chest with white predominant on the neck and throat and slowly fading as it reaches the abdomen.</p>
<p>Giant falcons are generally solitary hunters, though excursions consisting of up to four of these creatures are not unheard of. Such hunting teams communicate with each other, relaying their position as well as the position of their target through vocalizations consisting of loud squawks and cries. A giant falcon attacks by swooping down on its foe and raking with its talons and stabbing with its beak.</p>
<h3>Training a Giant Falcon</h3>
<p>A giant falcon must be trained before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant falcon must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check). Training a friendly giant falcon requires six weeks of work and a successful DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> check. Riding a giant falcon requires an exotic saddle. A giant falcon can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she makes a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride">Ride</a> check.</p>
<p>Giant falcon eggs are worth 1,500 gp each on the open market, while young bring the sum of 3,000 gp apiece. Professional trainers charge up to 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant falcon.</p>
<p><b>Carrying Capacity</b>: A light load for a giant falcon is up to 258 pounds; a medium load, 259â519 pounds; and a heavy load, 520â780 pounds. A giant falcon can drag up to 3,900 pounds.</p>

<p><b>Environment</b> any underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or cluster (3â4)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Otyughs are particularly vile and horrid creatures that lurk in places most sane creatures avoid. Their lairs are middens, cesspools, offal pits, toxic swamps, and sewersâthe greater a lair’s filth, the greater the draw to the refuse-eating otyugh. They glory in the role of scavenger, wandering through vast underground caverns in search of the choicest cuts of garbage and waste. Upon finding such refuse, they gorge upon it, gathering what cannot be consumed in one debauch to bring back to their foul-smelling lairs. Otyughs spend most of their time in these filthy dens, which they keep constantly filled with carrion, dung, and worse sorts of stinking effluvia.</p>
<p>Intelligent creatures dwelling in subterranean areas near an otyugh often form a partnership of convenience with the disgusting beast. These creatures gladly provide their refuse and piles of raw meat to the otyugh, transforming the creature into an effective form of trash disposal. In return, the otyugh leaves its benefactors alone, and does not attack them, possibly even acting as a guardian.</p>
<h3>Variants</h3>
<p>Otyughs sometimes dwell in environments with dangerous hazards and strange food sources. As a result, some exhibit odd mutations and other physical deformities.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh/otyugh-corpsefeaster">Corpsefeaster</a></b>: Some otyughs develop a particular taste for the flesh of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead">dead</a> creatures, preferring it above all other sources of food. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh/otyugh-corpsefeaster">Corpsefeaster otyughs</a> possess a particularly heinous ability that allows them to vomit forth a shower of rotting meat and bones in a 20-foot cone. Anyone caught in this cone must make a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for 1d4 rounds. Creatures caught in this cone must also make a save against the corpsefeasterâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>, as if it had bitten them. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh/otyugh-corpsefeaster">Corpsefeaster otyughs</a> lose the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-">constrict</a> ability.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/meat-puppet-cr-varies-fgg"><strong>Meat Puppet</strong></a>Â Meat puppets are boneless, skinless corpses reanimated after being exposed to necromantic energies.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh/otyugh-mutant"><b>Mutant</b></a>: An otyugh might be born with an extra tentacle (adding one tentacle attack), another leg (increasing speed by 10 feet), or webbed feet and gills (granting a swim speed of 30 and the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Amphibious-Ex-">amphibious</a> subtype).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh/otyugh-oozing"><b>Oozing</b></a>: Otyughs that dwell in caustic environments, or those that dine on alchemical refuse, may develop the ability to secrete an acidic toxin through their hide.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh/otyugh-plaguebearer"><b>Plaguebearer</b></a>: Considering where they live, otyughs make for natural <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> carriers. Otyughs are immune to filth fever, the most common ailment for those visiting the sewers or swamps, and every otyugh is a carrier of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a>. Sometimes, however, an otyugh can become infected with so many ailments that it becomes a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh/otyugh-plaguebearer">plaguebearer otyugh</a>. These disgusting creatures are covered in lesions, boils, and rashes, and anyone in combat with them risks contracting a truly terrible sickness. Among their own kind, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh/otyugh-plaguebearer">plaguebearers</a> are regarded as prophets, and make proclamations (of dubious wisdom or veracity) to others of their kind, who accept these statements as truth. While other otyughs are smart enough to keep their distance,they often help to feed their stricken cousins and use them to punish those who intrude upon their domain.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/otyugh/otyugh-plaguebearer">Plaguebearer otyughs</a> are in constant pain, leading many to believe they are in a sort of rage. Because they lack the proper appendages to sooth their wounds, these wretched creatures spend most of their time mindlessly bashing at anything that moves, desperate to distract themselves from the pain.</li>
<li><b>Scaly Otyugh (CR 5)</b>: At first glance a scaly otyugh appears to be one of its normal cousins, but closer inspection reveals its body is covered in mottled scales and its tentacles end in the heads of poisonous <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake">snakes</a>. A scaly otyugh has the same statistics as a normal otyugh, but with the following changes:
<ul>
<li>+3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor</a></li>
<li>Poison Bite (Ex) A bite from one of a scaly otyughâs snake heads injects <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> that weakens its prey: injury; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 14; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 6 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Str</a>; <i>cure</i> 1 save. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a>: a scaly otyugh has a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks when in its lair, due to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural</a> coloration.</li>
<li>A scaly otyugh has a CR of 5.</li>

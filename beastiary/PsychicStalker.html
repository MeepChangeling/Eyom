<h4><span id="Charisma_Damage_Su">Charisma Damage (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A psychic stalkerâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a> deals 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> to a living creature. Each time a creature takes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> from a psychic stalker that would normally exceed the creatureâs current <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> score, the creature must make a successful DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw or die. This is a negative energy effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Fleeting_Possession_Sp">Fleeting Possession (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a psychic stalker can enter an adjacent living creatureâs body and begin to destroy its mind in a violent attempt to feel alive. The psychic stalker can initiate this process only on a creature that has taken an amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> equal to or greater than half the creatureâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> score.</p>
<p>This effect functions as per possession (CL 8th; <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 20; the save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based), but the target continues to take damage each round as if it had been struck by the psychic stalkerâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/psychic">Psychic</a> stalkers delight in possessing creatures immune to negative energy, since the stalkers donât affect those creaturesâ <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> scores and can inhabit them indefinitely. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that psychic stalkerâs possession for 24 hours.</p>
<h4><span id="Formless_Ex">Formless (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A psychic stalker has no visible form, but creatures that have taken <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> from its attacks hallucinate a screaming skull within a ghostly haze, allowing them to damage the creature normally. It is treated as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a> to all other creatures, but as it has no true form or substance, effects like <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility-purge">invisibility purge</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/see-invisibility">see invisibility</a>, and even <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/faerie-fire">faerie fire</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/glitterdust">glitterdust</a> donât negate this ability (though <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> provided by thoughtsense can be used to locate a psychic stalker). The ability to hallucinate a psychic stalker and negate its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a> after taking <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Psychic stalkers are the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> minds of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/psychic">psychic</a> spellcasters who suffered unexpectedly violent deaths.</p>
<p>Such minds are sometimes powerful enough to persist even after their bodiesâ <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/destruction">destruction</a>, transforming into <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a> creatures composed entirely of thought, yet they retain no true memories or abilities from their former existence. Knowing only that they are missing a vital part of their being, psychic stalkers are ruled by the envious desire to take control of new bodies.</p>

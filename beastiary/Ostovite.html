<h4><a name="TOC-Bone-Chariot-Su-"></a>Bone Chariot (Su)</h4>
<p>An ostovite presented with a corpse that in life had 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> or fewer (not counting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> from class levels) and that contains a skeletal structure can spend 1 hour extracting the bones and then softening and reweaving them around itself, creating a deformed and skeletal version of the original creature. This âbone chariotâ functions as if the corpse had reanimated and gained the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a> template, but gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">construct</a> type instead of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> type and has no will of its ownâit moves and attacks at the direction of the ostovite, which rides in its center.</p>
<p>An ostovite cannot use its own attacks while ensconced in its bone chariot, and damage done to a bone chariot does not harm the ostovite until the bone chariot has been reduced to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, at which point the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeleton</a> crumbles and the ostovite can attack and be attacked as normal.</p>
<p>Multiple ostovites can combine their abilities to animate the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeletons</a> of larger creatures, so long as they all ride within the same bone chariotâeach additional ostovite increases the maximum <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a> of the corpse that can be animated by this ability by 2.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Abyss)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or nest (3â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Tiny Abyssal scavengers, ostovites skitter across demonic battlefields, amid charnel pits, and through that plane’s festering sewers looking for corpses on which to feed. When they find these morsels, they use their acidic saliva to digest the flesh, taking what they need for sustenance. Yet what ostovites truly desire is not food, but self-improvement.</p>
<p>Though only barely intelligent, ostovites have a deepseated jealousy of larger races, as well as an instinctive shame regarding their own forms, which resemble silverfish made out of thin, compressed bones. When an ostovite locates the corpse of a larger creatureâ particularly that of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> or other intelligent beingâit doesn’t stop at feeding. Instead, as soon as it has sated its hunger, it begins using its acid to soften the creature’s bones, drawing them out and reconstructing them into a twisted parody of their original configuration, with the ostovite resting in a nest-like structure in the sculpture’s center. Once it’s finished, the ostovite magically animates its creation, controlling it like a puppet and at last experiencing the thrill of being larger andâto the ostovite’s mindâmore important. These ghastly creations are generally more disturbing than normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a>, as ostovites’ understanding of biomechanics is often crude, potentially resulting in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeletons</a> that move around on all fours or drag themselves along like landbound octopuses. Like hermit crabs changing shells, ostovites regularly replace their chariots in order to increase their social status and impress potential mates.</p>
<p>Though they often squabble over smaller <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/skeleton">skeletons</a>, when a particularly prime corpse is located, an entire nest of ostovites may band together to create a single bone chariot of epic proportions.</p>
<p>Adult ostovites are 2 feet long and weigh 3 pounds. Natural cowards except when enshrined in their chariotsâat which point most believe themselves invincibleâ ostovites have a species-wide hatred of the more powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-vermlek">vermlek demons</a>, with whom they often compete for quality corpses.</p>

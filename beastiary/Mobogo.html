<h1>Mobogo</h1>
<p class="description">Of bulbous body and bizarre shape, this gigantic, toad-like beast combines the most disgusting traits of dragon and amphibian. Reptilian wings unfurl from its leaking corpulence, its frame heaped with rolls of corded muscle and moist frog fat. Three buckler-sized yellow eyes protrude above a wide, drooling maw lined with teeth the size of daggers. From this cavernous hollow echoing with deep croaking belches darts a thick tongue the color of an angry bruise, darting forth to greedily snatch up flies, birds, and anything else that comes too near.</p>

<p>Huge and hungry, mobogos merge the features of gigantic toads and swampy <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragons</a>, and lair in the deepest, oldest swamps. Here, whole tribes of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/boggard">boggards</a> serve the beasts’ fickle, capricious whims.</p>
<p>Mobogos reside in the most primal swamps of the world, grotesque eldritch wildernesses unchanged for centuries. Boggards believe that in ancient times, after their fecund <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demon</a> goddess deposited her frogspawn in the muddy morass of the world’s still-forming continents, mobogos were among the first creatures to emerge. Ever since, the mobogos have slept and fed, preying upon the beasts of their fetid meres, growing huge and lethargic, and dreaming inscrutable amphibious dreams of their godly mother’s return. Nearly all mobogos are attended by tribes of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/boggard">boggards</a>. Mobogos care little for matters of origins and philosophiesâthey care only for the endless sacrifices of food, victims, and pleasing swamp art brought to them by their obedient tribes.</p>
<p>Most mobogos stand approximately 18 feet tall and weigh upward of 3 tons. A mobogoâs loudest croaks cut through the humidity and underbrush of even the densest swamps and can be heard up to a mile away.</p>

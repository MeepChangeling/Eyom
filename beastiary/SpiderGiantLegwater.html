<p class="description">A man-sized arachnid swiftly appears from the darkness, skimming along the waterline with unnatural ease while its mandibles snap menacingly at the air.</p>

<p>When attacking a swimming target while using its waterlegs ability, a legwater spider deals +2d4+2 precision damage with its bite attack and treats the target as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>. While submerged a legwater spider gains a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> to attack and damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Limited_Submersion_Ex">Limited Submersion (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A legwater spider can remain underwater (âholding its breathâ) for a number of rounds equal to its hit die + <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> modifier. Afterwards the legwater spider must remain in breathable atmosphere for twice as many rounds.</p>
<p>A legwater spider may fire its web while underwater, though its range is halved.</p>
<h4><span id="Waterlegs_Ex">Waterlegs (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Legwater spiders have expanding membranes that snap out from the ends of their talons.</p>
<p>These allow them to walk on water and similar surfaces, treating them as regular terrain.</p>
<h4><span id="Wily_Ex">Wily (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Legwater spiders are extremely aggressive and territorial; any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal">Handle Animal</a> checks made against them (regardless of class abilities) are at a â4 penalty and spells targeting them that specifically target <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin">vermin</a> are cast at â4 CL.</p>

<p>This unique breed of arachnid is highly sought after by zookeepers and biologists, well known to aquatic explorers for their deadly tactics. Scholastic debate on the origins of these insects remains heated, many defaulting to the popular speculative theory that one of the underworldâs many unique fungi are the cause. Regardless of how they came to be, aquamancers are always interested in acquiring giant legwater spidersâdead or alive.</p>

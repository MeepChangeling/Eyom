<h1>Yothga</h1>
<p class="description">This massive tangle of vines is covered in thin, pointed leaves. Several vines end in lush, many-petaled blossoms of an unnatural crimson hue.</p>

<h4>Mind Drain (Ex)</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, the yothga can use one of its blossoms to feed on the intellect and personality of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> creature. The creature must succeed at a DC 18 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or take 1 point each of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> and be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> for 1 round. On a successful save, the target takes no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">ability damage</a> and is instead <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round. The yothga gains 10 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> and its blossoms shed light equal to a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Torch">torch</a> each time it successfully inflicts <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">ability damage</a>. These effects last for a maximum of 1 hour.</p>
<p>This ability does not function on creatures without an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-">Intelligence</a> score. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any forest or underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or patch (2-8)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>The yothga, also known as the devil flower, is not of this world.</p>
<p>They originate on a distant planet and their seeds are borne aloft on the winds until they escape the atmosphere.</p>
<p>They drift across the black reaches of space and instinctively seek planets with intelligent life upon which to root and grow. Yothga feed upon their preyâs body and mind, draining its intellect first, then allowing the bodies to decompose and fertilize the soil in which they root.</p>
<p>A typical yothga is a cluster of woody, tendril-like vines some 10 to 12 feet long, covered in thin, blade-like leaves of dark green.</p>
<p>The vines sprout from a central root cluster, which branches into deep-delving roots that anchor the yothga in place but can be withdrawn quickly should it wish to move. The vines sport three to six blossoms, each about the size of a human head and formed of layers of petals surrounding three whip-like pistils.</p>
<p>Each flower is a bright crimson, becoming brighter when the yothga feeds to the point where they gain a phosphorescent glow.</p>
<p>The sap of a yothga is edible and highly nutritious, and can be harvested with a successful DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> check. There is enough sap in a full-grown yothga to provide up to three daysâ worth of rations for a Medium-sized <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a>.</p>
<p>Yothga have a dim, malicious sentience and delight in slowly draining their victims. They keep particularly savory victims alive for weeks by draining them to helplessness, sustaining them with their nutritious sap long enough to heal some <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">ability damage</a>, and draining them repeatedly. They are sometimes nurtured by evil spellcasters capable of communicating with the yothga, who use them as guardians or prison wardens in exchange for providing intelligent creatures as fodder.</p>

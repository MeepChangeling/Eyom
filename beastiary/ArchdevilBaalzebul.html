<h4><span id="Biting_Blackflies_Ex">Biting Blackflies (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Baalzebulâs body consists of innumerable flies. The first time in a round a creature strikes him with a melee <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attack</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed">unarmed strike</a>, the creature is subjected to these fliesâ savage stings and bites. The creature takes 7d6 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 42 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> with pain for 1 round. These biting flies cling tenaciously to the attacker for 1 round, dealing 7d6 points of damage on the attackerâs next turn (but not threatening nausea). Any damage from an area effect destroys clinging flies, though they share Baalzebulâs resistances and immunities, including <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>. If Baalzebul does not move more than 5 feet in a round, any creature that approaches or begins its turn within 10 feet of him is affected in the same way. Any number of targets can be affected in a round by the biting blackflies, but no more than once per round per target. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Hellfrost_Su">Hellfrost (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Half of any cold damage dealt by Baalzebul is <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy">unholy</a> damage that is not reduced by cold <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance">resistance</a> or cold <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a>. <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil">Devils</a> are immune to this <a class="magic-item" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy">unholy</a> damage, but it is doubled against creatures with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Good">good</a> subtype.</p>
<h4><span id="Lord_of_the_Flies_Su">Lord of the Flies (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Any creature flying under its own power (not by means of a magic item, spell, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>) that tries to attack Baalzebul in melee must succeed at a DC 39 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or the attack fails and is wasted. In addition, if it fails the save, the attacker is so awed by Baalzebulâs majesty that it cannot look at him directly for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed at the save are immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Suffocating_Swarm_Su">Suffocating Swarm (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Baalzebul can collapse into a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> of flies or reform his body as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>; when he is discorporated, his sword becomes part of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> and his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> score becomes 1. Baalzebul functions as a true <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> of Fine creatures when discorporated, filling four squares as he chooses, and has a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> attack that deals 7d6+26 points of damage. Any creature that fails at a DC 42 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save against his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Distraction-Ex-">distraction</a> attack is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> and begins suffocating, as a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suffocation">suffocation</a> spell (CL 30th). If killed by this <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suffocation">suffocation</a>, the creature arises 1 minute later infested by a hellwasp <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> (a successful DC 42 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save immediately before death negates). The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Swarm_Body_Ex">Swarm Body (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Baalzebulâs body is composed of millions of tiny flies. He can pass without difficulty through narrow holes, openings, and cracks as if in <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form">gaseous form</a>. He has no discernible anatomy and is not subject to critical hits or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking">flanking</a>, and he takes only half damage from attacks dealing bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If reduced below 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, he discorporates into a suffocating <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> (as above) and is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a>, but does not fall <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious">unconscious</a>.</p>
<p>Baalzebul is immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells and rays) unless he chooses to target himself with such effects, though he is still subject to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effects. He takes half again as much damage (+50%) from area effects, including <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon">splash weapons</a>. Baalzebul is treated as a single Large creature for the purpose of wind effects.</p>
<h4><span id="Swarm_Master_Su">Swarm Master (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Baalzebul is immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> damage and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> effects (such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Distraction-Ex-">distraction</a>).</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, he can direct the movement of any unintelligent <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarm</a> within 30 feet.</p>
<h4><span id="Usurpation_Su">Usurpation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a creature within 30 feet targets itself with a spell or effect, as an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a> Baalzebul can gain the same effects as the caster (including interacting normally with a caster using <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/time-stop">time stop</a>).</p>
<p>Baalzebul can have only one usurped spell effect at a time; copying a new effect causes him to forfeit any previously copied effect.</p>

<p>Baalzebul was once the chief lieutenant of the Prince of Darkness. The glorious <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hellâs</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel">Angel</a> sought to rule at Asmodeusâs side, but he was greatly vexed at being relegated to stand alongside other archdevils. When he demanded a higher station, claiming he should rule over multitudes, the Lord of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a> annihilated his magnificent angelic form, replacing it with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm">swarms</a> of insects so he might rule over them in their millions as Lord of the Flies. Chastened, Baalzebul has brooded on vengeance ever since, harboring an insatiable urge to prove himself greatest among <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hellâs</a> lords. His knowledge and power are vast, but so are his caprice, ego, love of flattery, and tendency to lash out at any perceived slight.</p>
<p>Baalzebul resembles a 15-foot-tall armored <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel">angel</a> and has a body composed of flies.</p>
<h3 class="header"><span id="Baalzebuls_Cult">Baalzebulâs Cult</span></h3>
<p>Baalzebulâs cultists strive to accomplish triumphs of will in the fields of magic, politics, and beyond, no matter the cost. Once such a victory has been achieved, they gloat over those left behind. Baalzebulâs sacred places are always erected high above the surrounding cities or landscape, often in soaring towers and colossi, the better to literally and figuratively look down on those whose defeat awaits them at the hands of those bold and ruthless enough to will it.</p>
<p>Baalzebulâs unholy symbol is a broken black crown tipped at an angle, underneath a shining white diamond inside a broken white halo. Although he prefers the use of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a> himself, his arrogance prevents him from sharing his favor of that weapon with his worshipersâinstead, his favored weapon is the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/spear">spear</a>. He grants access to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Air">Air</a>, Death, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil">Evil</a>, and Law domains, and to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil">Devil</a>, Murder, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">Undead</a>, and Wind subdomains.</p>

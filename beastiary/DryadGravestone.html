<h1>Dryad, Gravestone</h1>
<p class="description">This woman reeks of rot and earth, has dead wood for flesh, hair tangled with twigs and decayed leaves, and hands ending in wicked claws.</p>

<h4><span id="Entomb_Su">Entomb (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Three times per day as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a gravestone dryad can entomb a living being within 100 feet of it in a hard-packed dirt <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Coffin">coffin</a> set in a shallow grave (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 19 negates). The victim is considered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> in the graveâs tight confines. It also has no air, so must hold its breath to avoid suffocating.</p>
<p>It can escape the grave with a DC 30 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> check or by destroying the dirt coffin (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 8, 30 hp, break DC 25). The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p>A creature killed in this manner automatically rises as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombie</a>, breaking free of the coffin 1 round later. The new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombie</a> is under the gravestone dryad’s control and doesnât apply to the HD of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> she controls with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead">animate dead</a>. If the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryad</a> is destroyed, the zombie becomes free-willed.</p>
<h4><span id="Grave_Meld_Su">Grave Meld (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A gravestone dryad can meld with a grave, similar to how the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/meld-into-stone">meld into stone</a> functions, though the grave need only be half the size of the gravestone dryad. She can remain melded with a grave as long as she wishes.</p>
<h4><span id="Tied_to_the_Grave_Su">Tied to the Grave (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A gravestone dryad is bonded to a single graveyard and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. If she does, she immediately becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a>. Every hour thereafter, she must succeed at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save to resist becoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for an hour. A gravestone dryad that is out of range of her bonded graveyard for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a>, and another 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Charisma damage</a> every day that follows.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryad</a> can forge a bond with a new graveyard by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any graveyard<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>Gravestone dryads are twisted versions of their former selves, created when a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryad</a>‘s tree is felled near a cemetery.</p>
<p>The combination of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryad</a>‘s death, loss of her tree, and collective sorrow of the cemeteryâs mourners calls to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryad</a>‘s soul and reunites it with its former body, which immediately sets out for the graveyard. They crave lifeâdespite not needing it for sustenanceâand despise the living for having what they no longer have. They lurk, listen, and watch during the day while melded with gravestones, and send out <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie">zombie</a> minions by night to lure or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Drag">drag</a> back victims, but they are not above opportunistic kills during the day.</p>
<p>Gravestone dryads feel compelled to kill at least once per month but exercise patience to avoid discovery, going weeks between taking victims.</p>
<p>Much as gravestone dryads wish to destroy life, there is nothing they hate more than living fey and they go out of their way, even if it risks exposure, to destroy any fey they find. The dryads often travel to areas containing portals to the Fey World, simply to destroy fey as they pass from this world to the other. In return, fey seek out gravestone dryads to destroy them permanentlyâthough often fey fall prey to their own self-assurance and wind up as zombies under a gravestone dryadâs control.</p>
<p>Fey fear that gravestone dryads and corrupted <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/treant">treants</a> might work together in the future to destroy the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> realms, but so far these fears have been unfounded.</p>

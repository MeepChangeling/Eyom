<p>A skrimsl is immune to electricity damage. However, if it is subjected to an electricity attack (not including skrimslsâ electricity attacks), it regains 2d6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> and gains a bonus use of its <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/lightning-bolt">lightning bolt</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a>.</p>
<p>This bonus <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/lightning-bolt">lightning bolt</a> lasts for 24 hours and functions as if under the effects of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/empower-spell-like-ability">Empower Spell-Like Ability</a> when used.</p>
<p>A skrimsl can have only one bonus <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/lightning-bolt">lightning bolt</a> stored up in this manner at any one time.</p>
<h4><span id="Electricity_Field_Su">Electricity Field (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>, a skrimsl can generate a field of electricity that deals 2d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius at the start of the skrimslâs turn (no save). At the start of the skrimslâs turn on the 4th round after the field is activated, it discharges this field. All creatures within a 10-foot radius of the skrimsl that fail a DC 23 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save take 12d6 points of electricity damage and become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1d3 rounds. Creatures that successfully save take half the electricity damage and negate the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stun</a> effect. Once the electricity field discharges in this manner, the skrimsl must wait 10 rounds before activating it again. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution-based</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Elusive_Su">Elusive (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Skrimsls are rarely discovered except by their own choice. As a full-round action while in water, a skrimsl can swim at a speed of up to 200 feet per round without leaving any trace of its passage (identical in effect to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/pass-without-trace">pass without trace</a>).</p>
<p>An elusive skrimsl gains a +40 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks. In addition, when not in combat, a skrimsl is considered to be under the effects of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/nondetection">nondetection</a> spell. These effects function at <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> 20th and cannot be dispelled.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> cold oceans<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or pod (3â9)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Skrimsls are mysterious eellike creatures that dwell in the worldâs most frigid remote waters, particularly the deep waters of fjords. They prefer to avoid contact with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>, but communities near the lakes and fjords where skrimsls make their homes have no doubt that these beasts are very real and should be given proper respect.</p>
<p>Skrimsls have a glimmer of intelligence and remember those who have wronged them as well as those who have treated them well.</p>
<p>Skrimsls resemble massive <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/eel">eels</a> with blue scales matching the cold, clear waters they live in. They can be found in the deepest freshwater lakes and the salt waters of the sea, and are capable of thriving in both environs. The creatures use their electricity fields and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> both for defense and to catch prey. They also have a dangerous bite and powerful tail, which they use to destroy oars, weapons, and other implements used by land-dwelling foes.</p>
<p>A typical adult skrimsl measures 45 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds.</p>

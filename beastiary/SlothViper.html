<p>The sloth viper is a lightning-quick predator most often found in dense, thick jungles or overgrown swamplands. The typical sloth viper is 9-10 feet long, though they can grow to a length of 20 or more feet. They subsist on a diet of small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a>, preferring birds, lizards, and small mammals to others. They are fearless however, and do not hesitate to attack much larger prey such as cheetahs, leopards, and even lions. Once the sloth viper has fed, it often recoils high above the ground, under the thicket and blanket of leaves, branches, and limbs where it sleeps for the next 1d6 days.</p>
<p>The sloth viper is a solitary predator; rarely is more than one encountered. If such an encounter takes place, they are often a mated pair, with a nest of eggs nearby. A sloth viper’s lair is a dense thicket of natural underbrush and trees. A typical nest contains 1d4 emerald colored eggs.</p>
<p>Sloth vipers are hunted by some <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> for their scales and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> (which is rumored to be valued by spellcasters for its properties).</p>

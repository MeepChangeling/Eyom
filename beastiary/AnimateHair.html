<h4><span id="Empathy_Su"><a name="TOC-Empathy-Su-"></a>Empathy (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Animate hair can communicate empathically with a host it is attached to. This empathy allows the animate hair to encourage or discourage certain actions by communicating emotions and urges. It does not allow verbal communication.</p>
<h4><span id="Infestation_Su"><a name="TOC-Infestation-Su-"></a>Infestation (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Animate hair can climb onto and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Attach-Ex-">attach</a> itself to a willing or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> Medium or Small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>. The animate hair shares the same 5-foot square as its host’s space. This doesn’t negatively impact the host or the animate hair. Attacks that hit an attached animate hair deal half their damage to the animate hair and half to the host. The animate hair can be removed from its host with a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check against the animate hair’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense">CMD</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Murderous_Whispers_Sp"><a name="TOC-Murderous-Whispers-Sp-"></a>Murderous Whispers (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>Animate hair can use the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/murderous-command">murderous command</a> spell (DC 13) on its host at will with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> equal to its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Dice</a>. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the animate hair’s <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/murderous-command">murderous command</a> for 24 hours.</p>
<p>The DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any urban<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary or clog (2â6)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Animate hair is carnivorous, and can survive by hunting the small <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a> that inhabit urban environments.</p>
<p>Animate hair’s preferred prey, however, is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>. By disguising itself as a wig, animate hair is able to subtly influence the creature that wears it. At first, the hair merely makes its host more vain, but when the opportunity presents itself, the animate hair compels its host to murder.</p>
<p>Though not particularly intelligent, animate hair possesses lingering instincts that cause it to urge these murders cautiously, and usually only when its host is unobserved.</p>
<p>Each animate hair has a preferred type of victim, perhaps influenced by its former life. The hair of an executed criminal might target judges, while that of a murdered debutante might target young women.</p>

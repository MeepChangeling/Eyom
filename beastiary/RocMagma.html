<h1>Roc, Magma</h1>
<p class="title">Magma Roc <span class="level">CR 10</span></p>
<p class="description">This strange, agile creature swoops aloft on black and orange wings, using four fins along its back to navigate deftly through the air. At the end of each of its four limbs are sharp talons that glow with heat.</p>

<h4>Sonic Scream (Ex)</h4>
<p>A magma roc can spend a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> to channel their voices into a tight, powerful beam of sonic force; on a successful hit, this ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> deals 9d8 sonic damage to a target within 60 feet, stunning them. A DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save reduces the damage to half and negates the stunning effect. This ability is usable once every 1d4 rounds and does not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> mountains, underground (volcanoes)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or attack wing (4-8)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/roc">rocs</a> are slightly reduced in size but completely immune to fire, living in nests placed above magma vents for both comfort and safety. Centuries of existence in the underworld have significantly changed how they perceive the world around them; the magma <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/roc">rocs</a> eyes have evolved into bizarre auditory receptors. Whenever a magma roc unleashes a sonic scream (often the last thing their prey hears before being carried off for an untimely plunge into magma) these point away from the head, allowing the creature to retain its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsense</a> and place in the surroundings while paralyzing their victims. Local lore claims that the former race that occupied the ruins of the Rift domesticated these fearsome creatures and used them as mounts, but no Underworlder has been crazy enough to try it since.</p>

<h1>Crimson Death</h1>
<p class="description"> Seemingly made of red vapor, the crimson mist is an outstanding stealth hunter. The crimson death is vaguely humanoid in appearance, with arms, torso and a head being discernible. The creature has no distinct facial features, other than 2 glowing points where eyes should be.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Engulf-Ex-"></a>Engulf (Ex)</h4>
<p>When a crimson death strikes a target with one of its tentacles, it can immediately make an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Engulf-Ex-">engulf</a> attack, including moving into the opponent’s square. Targeted creatures can make <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> against the crimson death, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Engulf-Ex-">engulf</a> attack. Those who do not attempt <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a> can attempt a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> (DC 18) save to avoid being engulfedâon a success, they are pushed back or aside (target’s choice) as the crimson death moves forward. Engulfed opponents gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a> condition, are in danger of suffocating, are trapped within the crimson death’s body until they are no longer <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned">pinned</a>, and suffer 1d6 points of damage and 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> every round. A victim reduced to 0 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a> dies. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a>-based.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Susceptibility-Ex-"></a>Susceptibility (Ex)</h4>
<p>After draining its victim’s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>, the crimson death, sated from its feeding, moves at half its normal speed, loses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks (because it flushes crimson, hence the name), and suffers a â4 circumstance penalty to AC. These effects last for 1 hour.</p>

<p>A crimson death attacks from ambush, usually hiding in naturally occurring fog and waiting for potential prey to wander close. Often times, a crimson death uses sound (imitating cries for help, for example) in an attempt to lure a victim into its grasp.</p>

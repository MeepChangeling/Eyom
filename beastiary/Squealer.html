<h1>Squealer</h1>
<p class="description">This creature is about the size of a large gorilla. Its fur is long and yellowish-green in alternating splotches. Its shoulders are hunched and it has a forward-thrusting, pig-like head. Razor-sharp teeth line its mouth. Its four forelimbs sprout from its body â€“ two from the hunched back and the other two from high on the hindquarters. A fifth limb grows from the middle of its back. </p>

<p>Squealers are carnivorous predators found in dense forests. They are voracious creatures and spend a good part of their day hunting food.</p>
<p>Squealers communicate with others of their kind using a series of grunts, growls, and squeals. They cannot speak any known language. A typical squealer stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 400 pounds.</p>

<p>Spore rats are thought to be the result of an ancient ensorcelled experiment involving giant rats and one or more unknown plant or fungus creatures. No evidence exists to prove or disprove this theory however, so very little is known as to their true origin.</p>
<p>Spore rats favor damp environments such as rainforests and swamps where they build their nests and lairs from the underbrush, overgrowth, and mud or slime. A typical lair contains 10 or more creatures, with males dominating the pack nearly 2-to-1. Females generally avoid combat and confrontation unless the entire nest is threatened. Both males and females always fight to the death if defending their young. If threatened, a spore rat releases a spore cloud in an effort to detour would be aggressors. Failing this, it lashes out with its bite attempting to nauseate its opponents. Given the chance, a spore rat flees combat unless cornered.</p>
<p>Spore rats exist on a diet of plants, berries, and various funguses and lichens. Food is gathered by the hunters (almost always males) and carried back to the lair where it is stored in holes for future use (during the cold months and to feed the young). A typical spore rat hunting band often journeys up to 1 mile from its lair if no closer food source can be found.</p>
<p>A spore rat is typically up to 3 feet long and weighs about 30 pounds. Its fur is greenish-brown and is not actually fur at all, but tightly packed funguses and mushrooms. Its eyes are ruby red or pale yellow. Its claws and teeth are always filthy and are brownish-white in color.</p>

<p>Taer are shaggy, primitive, naked humanoids that may be related to the yeti. They resemble prehistoric humans but are more bestial and apelike. Their fur is coated with an oily, fatty substance excreted through the pores, which protects them from cold. Taer can see clearly even in heavy snowstorms due to a second transparent eyelid that protects the eye from blowing winds and heavy snow. Taer never wear clothing, although they do sometimes wear necklaces and bracelets of tooth and horn.</p>
<p>Taer do not have a formal language as such; they communicate with one another through grunts, hooting, and yelling, as well as a body language similar to that of apes.</p>
<p>Taer attack with their fists and bite, but occasionally use stone spears in combat. They are fierce creatures and very territorial, attacking any living creature that wanders into the area. Taer use their knowledge of the land to their advantage during combat by creating avalanches, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow">burrow</a>ing under snow and attacking from surprise, and using snow-covered pits to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps/">trap</a> their prey. They prefer to drive intruders off rather than kill them.</p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Taer-Society"></a>Taer Society</h3>
<p>Taers are nomadic creatures that band together in clans for protection, hunting, and social reasons. During the day, adults hunt for food, which consists of fruits, berries, nuts, insects, and game (goat, sheep, rodents, and the like). Though they do eat meat, taer do not hunt or eat humans or humanoids. Taer are extremely superstitious and fear metal and clothing and those that use and wear them. No taer ever wields or wears items of cloth or metal. Taer clans worship a snow-god to whom they offer sacrifices for protection and guidance. Each clan has a large stone idol of this snow god that is often located in the very heart of the clan or near the clan leader’s cave.</p>

<h4><span id="Keen_Scent_Ex"><a name="TOC-Keen-Scent-Ex-"></a>Keen Scent (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An oil shark can notice creatures by <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent">scent</a> in a 180-foot radius and detect blood in oil or water at ranges of up to one mile.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> Sea of Fire (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Fire">Plane of Fire</a> and Plane of Molten Skies)<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, school (2-5), or pack (6-11)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>The Sea of Fire, located on the Plane of Molten Skies and the Plane of Fire, is home to strange aquatic life (if they can be called that), but perhaps none is stranger than the mighty oil shark. These creatures spend their days swimming beneath the burning surface of the Sea of Fire, searching for prey. Their diet consists of other aquatic creatures found in the Sea of Fire such as fire crabs, oil worms, and the great fire whales. The latter is a particular favorite of the oil shark, and while the typical great fire whale outweighs (and is generally larger) than the typical oil shark, an oil shark pack has been known to attack and kill with ease a lone fire whale. Oil sharks have never been encountered outside the Plane of Molten Skies or Plane of Fire though sages believe the oil shark can exist in normal water.</p>
<p>Oil sharks are completely blind and rely completely upon their “sonar” to hunt their prey. Oil sharks generally behave as other sharks; circling their prey before striking with their powerful jaws. Non-aquatic prey (i.e., creatures that breathe air) are often grasped in its jaws and dragged below the surface of the burning sea where it drowns in the oily waters. Their oily hides allow them to glide smoothly and quickly through normal water.</p>
<p>Oil sharks are a delicacy of volcano giants and are often hunted by such creatures. The thick, metallic hide of an oil shark is prized by salamanders and they often hunt these creatures, kill them, and sculpt oil shark armor from the hide.</p>
<h4><span id="Oil_Shark_Armor_Medium_Armor">Oil Shark Armor (Medium Armor)</span></h4>
<p>Because of the natural oily nature of the metal in an oil sharkâs scales (which retain these properties even after its death), a creature suffers no penalty to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim">Swim</a> checks for wearing this armor and also adds a +5 bonus to all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> checks. In addition, a creature wearing oil shark armor is unaffected by obstructions such as webs (magical or otherwise).</p>
<p><b>Cost</b> 1,000 gp (usually canât be bought); <b>Armor Bonus</b> +6; <b>Maximum Dex Bonus</b> +2; <b>Armor Check Penalty</b> â4; <b>Arcane Spell Failure</b> 30%; <b>Speed</b> 20 ft. (Base 30 ft.), 15 ft. (Base 20 ft.); <b>Weight</b> 40 lbs.</p>

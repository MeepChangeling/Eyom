<h4>Bioluminescence (Ex)</h4>
<p>All snarks share the ability to glow, shedding light like a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Candle">candle</a>. This is an involuntary action, which a snark can suppress for 1d6 minutes with a successful DC 12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Fey World)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or conspiracy (3â10)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>If the gods were hung over when they made birds, as many fey claim, they were deep in their cups when they created snarks. Some unusual step between avians and bats, snarks come in a variety of shapes and sizesâfrom insect-sized to large and dangerous predatorsâbut the smaller lyre snarks are the most common. Snarks live in forests, canyons, and towns of the Fey World. They mark their territory with loud songs, but keep themselves well hiddenâso much so that many outsiders believe they can turn invisible at will. Their wings feature dexterous little hands to pick at fruit, nuts, and the occasional shiny object. They are adept at picking parasites from larger creatures.</p>
<p>All varieties of snarks share the ability to glow softly when happy or excitedâmuch to their detriment, as this light attracts predators. In some parts of the Fey World, snarks share territory with birds, and are generally strong fliers but less adapted to running along the ground or through trees. Lyre snarks rarely weigh more than a pound. For larger and more aggressive snarksâsuch as the flesh-eating boojumâuse the statistics for an eagle, an owl, or a vulture.</p>
<p>Smaller snarks, like the one presented here, make affectionate pets, but are known for stealing small objects and treats from their owners to line a variety of nests and secret stashes they maintain. An arcane caster who selects a snark as a familiar gains a +3 bonus on Stealth checks, though snark familiars are vanishingly rare beyond the Fey World.</p>

<p>A cerebral stalker is a carnivorous predator that lies in wait just below the surface of the ground for an unsuspecting victim to pass over or near it. When it detects its prey, the stalker bursts through the ground in a shower of rock and earth, cocoons its victim and disappears into the ground to devour the victimâs brain.</p>
<p>The lair of a cerebral stalker is a large, hollow chamber of earth, often littered with skull fragments, bits of webbing, and chunks of brain matter. Cerebral stalkers are solitary creatures and do not work in concert with others of their kind. They attack those of their own race if another attempts to take up residence in an area already inhabited by a cerebral stalker (the typical stalkerâs hunting ground covers an area of 5 square miles, though it rarely journeys that far from its lair). The lifespan and reproduction method of these creatures is completely unknown.</p>
<p>The cerebral stalker prefers to attack from ambush, hiding just below the surface of the ground where it uses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Tremorsense-Ex-" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Tremorsense">tremorsense</a></a> ability to detect creatures moving above it. When it successfully detects a creature, it violently emerges from the ground (behind its target, if possible) and grabs the unsuspecting victim. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled" target="_blank">grappled</a> opponent is quickly cocooned and pulled beneath the ground where its brain is devoured. Those interfering with the stalker as it sinks into the ground are subjected to its fear gaze.</p>

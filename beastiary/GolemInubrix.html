<p>An inubrix golem can expel a 15-foot cone of yellowish gas as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a> once every 1d4 rounds. Creatures within the gas cloud feel their skin crawl and their senses deaden. Each creature within the area must succeed at a DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1d4 rounds and gain 1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels">negative level</a>.

<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Iron_Ex">Immunity to Iron (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Inubrix golems ignore the presence of iron and are able to pass through it as if they were <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal">incorporeal</a>. They are immune to iron weapons, and their attacks ignore any armor or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Shield-Bonus">shield bonus</a> to AC (including enhancement bonuses) from iron armor and shields.</p>
<p>These abilities also affect variations of iron such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold">cold iron</a>, living steel, and steel.</p>
<h4><span id="Immunity_to_Magic_Ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An inubrix golem is immune to spells and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> that allow <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance">spell resistance</a>.</p>
<p>Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A magical attack that deals fire damage slows an inubrix golem (as per <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a>) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.</li>
<li>A magical attack that deals cold damage dispels any <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow">slow</a> effect on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> and restores 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing">healing</a> would cause the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golem</a> to exceed its full normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>, it gains any excess as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points">temporary hit points</a> for 1 hour. An inubrix golem receives no saving throw against cold effects.</li>
<li>An inubrix golem targeted by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transmute-metal-to-wood">transmute metal to wood</a> permanently loses its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to iron and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a>, but it gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a> 5.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span id="Razor_Fingers_Ex">Razor Fingers (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>An inubrix <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem">golemâs</a> claws are razor sharp and threaten a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> on a roll of 18â20.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or gang (2â6)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>These deadly golems are crafted with a technique that incorporates inubrix, a rare skymetal, into their bodies. Due to the extraordinary material used in their construction, these golems are extremely rare throughout most of Golarion, found only in places with access to skymetals or in places where those who can afford such unique materials reside. Inubrixâs unique characteristics allow it to pass through iron and steel without any impact, as if it existed slightly out of phase with such metals. This strange property has given it the nickname of âghost iron.â Weaponsmiths were initially excited to learn that it could penetrate metal armor with ease. However, the soft metal is too malleable for effective crafting; weapons made from inubrix are weaker than their normal counterparts, making them less effective. Alloys of inubrix with other metals failed to maintain its unique property to phase through iron, causing many smiths to see it as a strange curiosity and nothing of practical value.</p>
<p>Because of its ghostlike properties, the odd metal has also earned a reputation for being related to necromancy, gluttony, and temperance. Some spellcasters report spectacular effects when using inubrix in the creation of magic items associated with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Necromancy">necromancy</a>, as the metal tends to accept magical enhancements from that magic school more readily than from other schools of magic.</p>
<p>This has led enterprising golem crafters to create the first inubrix golems. Rather than being imbued with an elemental spirit like many golems, inubrix golems gain their animating spark from negative energy, which seems to resonate particularly well with the inubrix used in their construction.</p>
<p>Though creators can craft these golems into any configuration they desire, most form inubrix golems that have a skeletal aesthetic. This grotesque appearance only adds to the necromantic mystique of the golem, its visage promising the one thing these monstrosities can deliver: a brush with death. These 11-foot-tall creations weigh about 5,000 pounds, but their <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/air-walk">air walk</a> ability allows them to navigate difficult and unstable terrain with ease. They cannot speak, though at times their metal bodies emit a low bass rumble.</p>
<h3><span id="Construction">Construction</span></h3>
<p>The creator must sculpt an inubrix golemâs body from 80,000 gp worth of inubrix and treat it with rare unguents worth 10,000 gp.</p>

<h3><span id="Variants">Variants</span></h3>
<p>As other golem crafters experimented with the original inubrix golems, they discovered viable variants, including those below.</p>
<h4><span id="Abysibrix_Golem_CR_0">Abysibrix Golem (CR +0)</span></h4>
<p>By creating an alloy of inubrix and abysium, a glowing blue-green skymetal that makes creatures sick through exposure, a golem crafter can make a sturdier golem, but at the cost of its ability to phase through iron. These golems lose their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to iron and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Rend-Ex-">rend</a> abilities, but their entire body is infused with a green-blue glow. They increase their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction">damage reduction</a> to 10/<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a>, and they leave behind a poisonous abysium residue with every successful claw attack.</p>
<p><b>Abysium Residue: Claw</b>â<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>; <em>save</em> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> DC 20; <em>onset</em> 1 minute; <em>frequency</em> 1/minute for 6 minutes; <em>effect</em> 1d2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> damage plus <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a>; <em>cure</em> 2 saves.</p>
<h4><span id="Ghost_Metal_Golem_CR_0">Ghost Metal Golem (CR +0)</span></h4>
<p>Ghost metal golems are enhanced specifically for assassination tasks. These golems take a more aggressive and bloodthirsty approach to combat, though they still follows all of their creatorsâ commands. Ghost metal golems lose their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Rend-Ex-">rend</a> special attack and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Breath-Weapon-Su-">breath weapon</a>, but gain the ability to deal an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage with each claw attack, and they can cast <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/ethereal-jaunt">ethereal jaunt</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like ability</a> three times per day.</p>

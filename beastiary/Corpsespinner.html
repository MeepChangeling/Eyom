<h1>Corpsespinner</h1>
<p class="description">A massive, bone-white tarantula is the only way to describe this monster. Bands of gray and silver ring its abdomen and legs, and its body is covered in short, bristly hairs of white and silver. A large skull-like marking appears on the creatureâs thorax. Its eight eyes are stark white.</p>

<p>Corpsespinners are highly aggressive extraplanar spiders originating on the Astral Plane. Only rarely do they enter the Material Plane in search of prey, choosing to hunt on the Astral Plane searching and devouring astral sharks and other native creatures. On the Material Plane, they often hunt other giant spiders or humanoids.</p>
<p>On the Astral Plane, corpsespinners spend their time constructing elaborate webs. The webs use many different things as anchor points such as rare natural occurring materials on the Astral Plane, corpses of deceased astral travelers, and just about anything else the corpsespinner can incorporate into its webbing. When not constructing its webs, the corpsespinner is usually hunting. And this sometimes leads it to the Material Plane. If encountered on the Material Plane, there is a good chance the corpsespinner has a group of corpsespun with it, the victimâs of its most recent kills.</p>
<p>Corpsespinners are primarily solitary creatures in regards to associating with others of their kind. Their ecology and reproduction cycles are unknown at this point, though intrepid interplanar adventurers have talked of huge webbed lairs on the Astral Plane containing young corpsespinners.</p>
<p>Corpsespinners hunt their prey on the Astral Plane, only occasionally entering the Material Plane to look for food. Once prey is sighted, the corpsespinner moves quickly to encase it in its sticky webbing before attacking repeatedly with its poisonous bite.</p>
<p>On the Material Plane it attacks a foe, shifts to the Astral Plane, and shifts back again to finish the opponent off. If forced to retreat, the corpsespinner shifts to the Astral Plane and returns to its lair. A corpsespinner usually has a gang of corpsespun with it (see the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/corpsespun-creature-cr-1">Corpsespun</a> template for details). In such a case, the corpsespinner attempts to web its foes and let the corpsespun move in to soften them up. The corpsespinner then charges in and bites its targets to finish them off.</p>

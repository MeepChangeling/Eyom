<p>The Stabbing Beast is the herald of the god of greed, murder, secrets, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a>. It is an incredibly dangerous predator that uses its keen intellect and deadly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> to stalk and kill its prey. Its natural form is that of a huge <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/scorpion">scorpion</a>, but it can also assume an armored <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> shape suitable for stealth or interacting with followers. Though its main purpose is to kill, it has also been called to aid great thefts and bury terrible secrets.</p>
<p>The Stabbing Beast is an incredibly dangerous predator, a creature of immense strength that uses its keen intellect and deadly poison to stalk and kill its prey. Its natural form is that of an huge <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/scorpion">scorpion</a>, but it can also assume an armored <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoid</a> shape suitable for stealth. Though its main purpose is to kill, it has also been called to aid great thefts and bury terrible secrets.</p>
<p>The Stabbing Beast enjoys the company of mortals in the same way that a well-fed barn cat enjoys the company of mice. It sometimes âplaysâ with these toys, teaching them secrets of alchemy or assassination, though it just as often maims or kills them as it sees fit. It ignores most creatures as if they were unimportant or not even alive, bowling over these irrelevant people in its way and casually murdering those who make nuisances of themselves.</p>
<p>The Stabbing Beast is guilty of thousands of killings and has no fear of death. It does not believe that anything other than its master can kill it, despite mortal records showing that it has been killed in the past. It is normally emotionless and cold, showing no remorse or regret for any death or injury. When a cult summons the Stabbing Beast, the mortals may present it with several choice targets to hunt and slay, though predicting its interests is difficult and the Beast may select its own targetâor none at allâ in exchange for its services. The Beast keeps trophies of its kills by covering the corpses in a preservative bile, swallowing them in its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/scorpion">scorpion</a> form, and regurgitating them when it returns to its lair.</p>
<p>The Stabbing Beast lives only to serve his dark master, whose mandates may come to the Stabbing Beast in a steady stream of evil deeds or sporadically and with long periods of dormancy between. When idle for too long, it tends to turn off its mind and simply waits in stasis, completely inert like a clockwork device that has run down.</p>

<p class="description">One of this slim constructâs arms ends in a whirling clockwork pistol, and a crystalline hourglass fits snugly between its pectoral armor plates.</p>

<p>Once per hour, a clockwork gunslinger can rotate its built-in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Hourglass">hourglass</a> as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> to instantly reload its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/pistol">pistol</a> and gain the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> for 1 round.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first time a clockwork gunslinger confirms a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits">critical hit</a> against an opponent, its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Hourglass">hourglass</a> shatters and each creature within a 30-foot radius of the clockwork gunslinger must succeed at a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be slowed as per the slow spell for 3 rounds. Once the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Hourglass">hourglass</a> is shattered, the clockwork gunslinger is unable to use this ability until a new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Hourglass">hourglass</a> is installed. This save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Integrated_Clockwork_Pistol_Ex">Integrated Clockwork Pistol (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>One of a clockwork gunslingerâs arms ends in an integrated clockwork pistol. This weapon cannot be disarmed, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder">sundered</a>, or removed. It is fed bullets automatically from an internal cache inside the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#subtype-clockwork">clockworkâs</a> body. Its programming grants <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/deadly-aim-combat">Deadly Aim</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/point-blank-shot-combat">Point-Blank Shot</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat">Precise Shot</a> as bonus feats.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or squad (3â8)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Clockwork gunslingers are efficient sharpshooters, eliminating foes before they can draw close enough to prove a threat. Their primary design is to serve as guards, either for a specific location, for a particular person, or patrolling bustling streets of a city, but their creators often use them for assistance on missions that involve extracting high-value targets from dangerous locations. The <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct">constructs</a>â standard operating procedure is to evaluate a situation and engage in combat only if their own safety or that of whatever they are guarding is threatened.</p>
<p>Inside a clockwork gunslingerâs hardened chassis, a large cache of bullets and powder is automatically fed into its pistol. Custom clockwork gunslingers sometimes have specialty ammunition in place of bullets as well as other decorations, though this change carries with it a corresponding upcharge.</p>
<p>A clockwork gunslinger stands 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.</p>

<h4><span id="Cabal_Ex">Cabal (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Multiple herecites can form a cabal to gain increased magical abilities and defenses. A cabal consists of two to five herecites. The ritual to form a cabal (or to welcome new herecites into an existing cabal) requires 24 hours of worship, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/prayer">prayer</a>, and vile <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sacrifice">sacrifice</a>, after which point the herecites become bound to the area in which the ritual was performed (this area can be no larger than one 50-foot cube per herecite in the cabal, to a maximum of five 50-foot cubes for a cabal of five herecites). If any one member of a herecite cabal leaves this area, it and all other herecites in the cabal lose all of the shared abilities granted by their cabal and they must perform the ritual once again to regain these abilities.</p>
<h4><span id="Desecration_Aura_Su">Desecration Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A hereciteâs very existence is an embodiment of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blasphemy">blasphemy</a> and heresy, and as such it exudes a 30-foot-radius aura of desecration. It and all <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> within this area gain a +2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack rolls</a>, damage rolls, and saving throws, and the DC to resist negative channeled energy in the area increases by 6. The herecite gains 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> per <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-">Hit Die</a> (+24 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> for most herecites). All of these benefits are calculated into the above statistics, and while they do not stack with those granted by <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/desecrate">desecrate</a> spells, neither do they <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/vanish">vanish</a> if the herecite enters an area under the effect of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/consecrate">consecrate</a> spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Faith-Stealing_Strike_Su">Faith-Stealing Strike (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Herecite Domains A herecite is associated with one evil god, and is always of the same <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> as that god. The herecite selects two domains granted by that god, gaining both domainsâ 1st-level spells as at-will <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, the 2ndlevel spells as 3/day <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, and the 3rd- and 4th-level spells as 1/day <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>. Inappropriate spells granted by domains, or spells that duplicate the hereciteâs existing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a>, are replaced with inflict spells of the same level. For example, a herecite with access to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/domains#TOC-Healing-Domain">Healing domain</a> would swap out all four of its cure spells for the inflict versions, while a herecite with access to Glory would swap out <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bless-weapon">bless weapon</a> for <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/inflict-moderate-wounds">inflict moderate wounds</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/searing-light">searing light</a> for <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/inflict-serious-wounds">inflict serious wounds</a>, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/holy-smite">holy smite</a> for <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/inflict-critical-wounds">inflict critical wounds</a>. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> are in addition to the hereciteâs base <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-">spell-like abilities</a> (<a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-good">detect good</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/see-invisibility">see invisibility</a>, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/u/unholy-blight">unholy blight</a>). The herecite presented here is a herecite of Asmodeus with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fire">Fire</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/domains#TOC-Trickery-Domain">Trickery</a> domains.</p>

<p>When a herecite is destroyed, it explodes, dealing 3d6 points of negative energy damage to all creatures in a 30-foot radius (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 21 half). Any nonevil creature damaged by this energy must also succeed at a DC 21 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or be affected by the hereciteâs faith-stealing strike.

<p>Herecites are a particularly blasphemous form of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> created via an obscure ritual of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sacrifice">sacrifice</a>, wherein a priest of an evil god offers up at least five worshipers of a nonevil deity to her own deity. All of the sacrifices must worship the same deity. Upon the deaths of the sacrificed worshipers, their souls and bodies seethe and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Surge">surge</a> with negative energy and then melt away, only to re-form into a single entityâa herecite. Even the hereciteâs appearance serves to support its heretical nature, for these foul creations always appear as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> versions of their prior god, even though in their new unlife they are devoted worshipers of the god to whom they were sacrificed. Regardless of the size and shape of the worshipers sacrificed and of the mythological size of their prior deity, a herecite is a human-sized creature.</p>
<p>The ritual for the creation of a herecite is recorded in certain rare and blasphemous texts that are hidden away in dark libraries. It is also known to exist in certain texts describing the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Outer-Planes">Outer Planes</a> and their denizens, and likely exists in texts associated with powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Necromancy">necromancy</a> cults, although groups composed primarily of arcane spellcasters find herecites more of a curiosity than a viable addition to their ranks. The ritual to create a herecite often focuses on the torture and slaughter of young, inexperienced priests while a captured leader of the same faith is forced to watch the cruel torment of his flock. The overwhelming pain and anguish experienced by the high priest as his acolytes are forcibly converted into <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> serves as the ritualâs catalyst. High priests driven mad or forced to lose their faith after they have witnessed such a ritual often rise again as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/huecuva">huecuvas</a> who then go on to gain levels as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle">oracles</a> of the ritualâs <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane</a> deity.</p>
<p>Herecites, once created, typically remain as guardians for the temple responsible for their forced conversion and do not seek a greater purpose in their new unlife. In some cases, a lone herecite may wander from the site of its creation, especially if it loses its creator, but once a group of herecites forms a cabal, its members remain bound to that area for months, years, or even centuriesâif they leave the area, the cabal is broken, and a new ritual must be performed in order to reaffirm their blasphemous faith. They have very little interest in their new lives save for the constant offering of blasphemous prayers to their new deity; these prayers often consist of warped versions of the sacred chants and songs of their prior faith.</p>

<h1>Spider, Sloth</h1>
<p class="title">Sloth Spider <span class="level">CR 9</span></p>
<p class="description">This enormous arachnidâs ghostly white carapace is covered in a sheen of green slime. Unlike other spiders however, it visibly moves far more slowly, making you wonder if it perhaps wounded or sickened.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Sloth spiders craft elaborate traps, and their favorite is a pit trap leading to its lair; the sloth spider lines the first half of the trap with mucous-like strands of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/green-slime-cr-4">green slime</a> and the second half with razor sharp stone scrapers (castings shed from its spiky stone legs) to scrape the slime off its victims before delivering it to its lair for the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#coup-de-grace">coup de grace</a>.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> Sloth spiders spit slime at enemies as they close to melee, relying on their lethargic aura to make enemies ineffective.</p>

<h4><span id="Lethargic_Aura_Ex">Lethargic Aura (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When engaged in strenuous activity, including combat, a vaporous mist surrounds the sloth spider out to a distance of 5 feet. Creatures in the mist must succeed a DC 22 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> as long as they remain in the mist. The DC for this ability is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Hasted_Burst_Ex">Hasted Burst (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Up to 5 times per day a sloth spider may draw on hidden reserves to clear the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> condition.</p>
<p>If it hits with both claw strikes it may <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Rend-Ex-">rend</a> for 2d6+13 damage (the two attacks represent strikes by two separate appendages). Every time the sloth spider uses this ability, it takes 2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>, and to use the ability again it must make first succeed a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save (DC equal to 10 + double the sloth <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/spider">spiderâs</a> current <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>).</p>
<h4><span id="Slime_Coating_Ex">Slime Coating (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The stone textured armor of a sloth spider is coated with a layer of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/hazards/green-slime-cr-4">green slime</a>. Creatures using one or more <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> against the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/spider">spider</a> must succeed on a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or take 1d3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>.</p>
<p>The slime does not have time to coat exposed extremities and does not need to be scraped off.</p>
<h4><span id="Spit_Slime_Ex">Spit Slime (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Once every 1d4 rounds (but no more than three times a day), a sloth spider can spit a 5-ft.-cube globule of dangerous green sludge. Treat the attack as a +9 ranged <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> with a range increment of 15 feet and maximum range of 30 feet. On a miss the slime scatters into one of the 8 surrounding squares (as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon">splash weapon</a>).</p>
<p>A creature occupying a square struck by spit slime must succeed on a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save to avoid it and on a success must exit the square the following round or suffer the effects of the goo (1d3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>). The DC for this ability is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-">Dexterity</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Staggered_Ex">Staggered (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The combination of its heavy stone carapace and the mix of magical chemicals and natural slimes in its bloodstream and digestive system grant the sloth spider the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> condition.</p>
<h4><span id="Trapmaker_Ex">Trapmaker (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The sloth spider is an accomplished natural trapmaker and gains ranks in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> (trapmaking) equal to its HD with a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a>. It uses it <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> modifier instead of its intelligence modifier when crafting traps.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, nest (3â6)<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Centuries ago <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a> attempted to breed a stronger and better armored <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/spider">spider</a> to use as a war mount. A series of mishaps with enlarging and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stoneskin">stoneskin</a> infusions were compounded by attempts to reverse past errors with <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> and Dexterity-enhancement magicâthe resulting creature was too slow to move with the armies and disinclined to any training whatsoever. The creatures were not unable to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Summon-Sp-">summon</a> bursts of speed, but during a last attempt at domestication a number of the aberrations slew their trainers and escaped into the wild.</p>
<p>With a metabolism slowed to almost nothing, sloth spiders sat for years in carefully crafted lairs, with trapped chutes and tubes waiting to deposit the unlucky. Green slime could detect the life within the boulder-like monstrosities and slurped up onto their rocky carapaces. The stony armor of the spiders stood up to the assault and only the most microscopic bits of slime burrowed into the creatureâs bloodstream and digestive tracts. Their slime mixed with the magical goop already coursing through the arachnidsâ systems and after centuries the sloth spider became able to spit it from reserves in their former poison glands. The odd creatures added the slime to their repertoire of trap making, now masters at waiting patiently for their next victims.</p>

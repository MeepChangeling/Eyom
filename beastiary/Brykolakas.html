<p>If a brykolakas is slain on land, its body collapses into a puddle of briny liquid that quickly covers a 10-foot square area. The puddle lasts for 1d2 rounds before dispersing. Creatures touching the puddle are exposed to the poison.</p>

<p>A brykolakas can survive out of the water for 6 hours. After that, its body begins drying out and within 1 hour, the brykolakas crumbles into dust unless it can reach saltwater before the hour passes.</p>

<p>Brykolakas are undead creatures that inhabit sunken cities or underwater caves. Their true origin remains a mystery to even the most learned of sages though stories among the learned speak of dark necromantic arts involving ancient magicks and packs of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul">ghouls</a>.</p>
<p>Brykolakases spend much of their time swimming the waves and terrorizing seafarers, boarding ships at night and carrying away unsuspecting passengers and crew members. Entire ships have docked in coastal towns, cargo intact, without a single clue as to the whereabouts or fate of the crew. When such an event occurs, a brykolakas is often blamed, its name being spoken in hushed whispers by the superstitious lest they anger such a creature and bring its wrath to bear on the town.</p>
<p>Some of these creatures lair near coastal towns or villages and occasionally raid such settlements at night, whisking away livestock, children, and the like. Events such as this are rare, but do happen from time to time.</p>
<p>A typical brykolakas stands between 6 to 7 feet tall and weighs 200 to 250 pounds. Its eyes, though gray and dull, often flash with a spark of hatred (usually when it encounters living creatures). The creature most often dresses in flowing and rotting robes and gowns of grays, greens, or blues.</p>
<p>A brykolakas is not a foolish creature. If faced with overpowering odds, it flees at the first opportunity, though sometimes the creature feigns such a retreat to lure its victims in where it springs to the attack again.</p>

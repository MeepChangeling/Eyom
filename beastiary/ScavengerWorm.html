<h1>Scavenger Worm</h1>
<p><i>This insectoid creature might be mistaken for a simple giant centipede, were it not for the circular, moray-like maw, the hard reflective chitin that clicks as it moves, and its complete lack of eyes. A thin trickle of something green and foul-smelling trickles from its mouth.</i></p>

<p>Although technically sightless, scavenger worms are capable of detecting and tracking prey as well as any sighted creature. When they come across living beings, they initiate combat with their tranquilizing spray, and then make every effort to grab at least one debilitated creature and drag it off to be consumed. If it senses no easy escape, however, it fights until all its prey is dead, or it believes itself to be overmatched.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Tranquilizing-Spray-Ex-"></a><b>Tranquilizing Spray (Ex)</b></h4>
<p>The scavenger worm can spit a viscous liquid in a 20-ft. cone. All living creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or fall asleep for 1d8+1 rounds. Victims can be awakened early with a DC 15 Heal check, as a full-round action, or with any variant of restoration or neutralize poison. Once it attacks with its spray, the scavenger worm cannot do so again for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>

<p>Scavenger worms roam the many underground caverns and cave systems, feeding on any and every living being they overpower, and any carrion they are fortunate enough to find. They are exceptionally territorial, attacking even on those rare occasions they might not be hungry. Still, they are just barely smart enough to flee from battle if they are badly losing.</p>
<p>Most scavenger worms strongly resemble giant centipedes. They average 9 to 11 feet in length, and roughly 600 pounds.</p>

<p>Greater gelid beetles are larger, meaner versions of the standard gelid beetle. They are almost always hungry and are usually encountered while hunting. These beetles enjoy the flesh of cold-dwelling animals such as moose, deer, snow leopards, and the like.</p>
<p>Greater gelid beetles use their cold cloud when threatened or cornered. Once the cloud has been released, the beetle either seeks escape (unless its hungry) or fights back with its powerful bite. Once its cold cloud recharges, the beetle releases it again if itâs still in combat.</p>

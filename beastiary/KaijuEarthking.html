<h4><span id="Landbreaker_Strike_Sp">Landbreaker Strike (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>As a full-round action, an Earthking can pound both massive fists into the ground, creating an effect identical to <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/earthquake">earthquake</a> cast by a 30th-level <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid</a>.</p>
<h4><span id="Protector_of_Children_Su">Protector of Children (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The for all the Earthkingâs might and instinct-driven savagery, the creature is fiercely protective of young <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a>, no matter the species. An Earthkingâs destructive powers, including its earthquake and tectonic command abilities never harm any creature in the young adult or younger age categories.</p>
<p>Characters in the young adult age category or younger can provide the otherwise mindless creature with morale bonuses, and often a gifted young singer (a good aligned <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-elf">half-elf</a> or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling">halfling</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a> 1) accompanies the goliath elemental, riding on its massive shoulder and advising it on how best to protect the land.</p>
<h4><span id="Tectonic_Command_Su">Tectonic Command (Su)</span></h4>
<p>The Earthking can reshape nearby terrain as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a> once per round. The Earthking can reshape up to four 20 ft. x 20 ft. squares of terrain at any point it can see within a 600 ft. radius. These 20 ft. squares can be contiguous or spread across the area. The Earthking can do any or all of the following to a 20 ft. square:</p>
<ul>
<li>…raise or lower the squareâs elevation by up to 100 ft.</li>
<li>…create or destroy difficult terrain</li>
<li>…transform ordinary ground into a 20 ft. deep pool of lava, or vice versa</li>
<li>…transform ordinary ground into a 20 ft. deep pool of water, or vice versa</li>
</ul>
<p>A character who is imperiled by a hazard can attempt a DC 40 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save to mitigate or negate the danger, similar to other effects that create pits, landslides or similar hazards.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any land (prefers mountains and canyons)<br/><b>Organization</b> always solitary<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>The Earthking is a legendary elemental guardian of the natural world, and the civilized peoples that inhabit that world. The Earthking slumbers for centuries at a time, curled in on itself so tightly that legends spring up that the massive stony outcropping is a legendary mountain, sacred monolith or holy mesa, a place where miracles happen. Locals usually credit the slumbering Earthking with miraculous cures, with impossible, blessed conceptions and with all sorts of fortunate coincidences and minor wonders.</p>
<p>The Earthking only awakes in times of great crisis â when danger so great it threatens the entire world arises.</p>
<p>A choir of children, representing all the intelligent races within the imperiled region, are assembled to sing for the long hours it takes to stir the Earthking to wakefulness. Once awakened, the goliath plods inexorably towards the threat, whether that threat is a rampaging army or a rampaging fellow kaiju. It fights on behalf of the land and people that summoned it, either destroying the threat or being destroyed itself.</p>
<p>The Earthking is a walking county, a goliath, barrel-chested humanoid figure hewn from mountain stone. The creatureâs heart is a single pulsing diamond larger than a royal palace. This impossibly huge diamond is encircled by a ring of smaller (yet still unbelievably huge) stones, each the size of a good-sized country inn. Despite the Earthkingâs trillion-ton bulk, it walks with surprising gentleness. Occasionally, even as it strides to war, the Earthking might bend down to examine a child or some small animal that catches its eye.</p>

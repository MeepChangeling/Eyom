<h1>Faceless Whale</h1>
<p class="description">A deep groan at the edge of hearing precedes the appearance of this sightless leviathan, whose pallid body breaks the surface of dark waters without as much as a ripple.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Blind-Ex-"></a>Blind (Ex)</h4>
<p>A faceless whale sees and senses exclusively through its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense">blindsight</a> ability, which is based on sound and movementâbeyond 150 feet, the whale is considered <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blind</a>. A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened">deafened</a> faceless whale is effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a> as well. It is invulnerable to all sight-based effects and attacks, including <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> attacks.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Resonant-Song-Su-"></a>Resonant Song (Su)</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a faceless whale can focus a 60-foot ray of sonic energy on a single target that deals 8d6 points of damage. This ray deals normal damage to objects, but is still subject to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness">hardness</a>. Alternatively, a faceless whale can blast this resonant energy in a 60-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 28 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> or be <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned">stunned</a> for 1d4 rounds. Any submerged creature holding its breath must succeed at a second <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw at the same DC or it has its breath knocked out of it and instantly begins drowning.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any water<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or pod (3â16)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>Faceless whales are enigmatic predators rarely encountered. Like cavefish, faceless whales lost their eyes and pigmentation from countless generations spent living and breeding in the lightless depths. The lack of pigmentation leaves the creatures’ skin little more than a transparent, blubber-lined film, with pulsing veins and churning organs visible beneath the silvery membrane. Sailors’ lore claims a faceless whale’s most recent meal shows through the taut skin of its belly. Some legends claim faceless whales began their lives as normal toothed <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/whale">whales</a>. </p>
<p>An adult faceless whale is 70 feet long and weights 90,000 pounds, though some specimens stretch these averages and grow half again as large.</p>

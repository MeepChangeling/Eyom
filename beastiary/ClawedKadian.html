<h1>Clawed Kadian</h1>
<p class="description">This ghost-like entity is covered with scales and spikes and has pincers for hands. Its glowing red eyes trail off into a smoke-like vapor. A sailorâs nightmare mermaid.</p>

<h4><span id="Affected_by_Bludgeoning_Su">Affected by Bludgeoning (Su)</span></h4>
<p>While a clawed kadian is an incorporeal creature, it is affected by bludgeoning weapons. A mundane bludgeoning weapon deals 50% damage, and a magic bludgeoning weapon deals its normal damage.</p>
<h4><span id="Create_Spawn_Su">Create Spawn (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A humanoid slain by a clawed kadian rises as a clawed kadian in 1d4 rounds. A spawn so created is less powerful than a typical clawed kadian, and suffers a â2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive â2 hp per HD, and only deals 1d6 Dexterity damage. A spawn is under the command of the clawed kadian that created it and remains enslaved for a year and a day, at which point it lose the spawn penalties and becomes a full-fledged and free-willed clawed kadian. A clawed kadian spawn does not possess any of the abilities it had in life.</p>
<h4><span id="Dexterity_Damage_Su">Dexterity Damage (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A clawed kadianâs touch deals 1d8 points of Dexterity damage to a living creature. This is a negative energy effect. A creature dies if this Dexterity damage equals or exceeds its actual Dexterity score.</p>
<h4><span id="Incorporeal_Grab_Su">Incorporeal Grab (Su)</span></h4>
<p>As part of an incorporeal touch attack, a clawed kadian can grab a corporeal creatureâs spirit, grappling them. The clawed kadian is treated as corporeal when initiating and maintaining a grapple; it is, however, treated as an incorporeal creature for all other purposes, such as opponents attempting to attack the clawed kadian. When the clawed kadian is grappling a creature, it can take the following actions: move, damage (from its incorporeal touch instead of its spiked body), and pin. It cannot tie up an opponent.</p>
<h4><span id="Slow_Aura_Su">Slow Aura (Su)</span></h4>
<p>When a creature comes within 30 ft. of the clawed kadian, it is overcome with lethargy and find they cannot move as quickly as normal. A creature that fails a Will save DC 19 can only take a standard action or a move action on their turn, not both. This effect counts as the slow spell for purposes of dispelling and being dispelled by <i><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a></i> and lasts for 6 rounds. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same creatureâs slow aura for 24 hours. Clawed kadians are immune to this ability. The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Spiked_Body_Su">Spiked Body (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A clawed kadianâs body has a number of large spikes on its body. Anyone grappled by the clawed kadianâs incorporeal grab takes 1d3 points of Dexterity damage every round the grapple persists.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any (Plane of Shadows)<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, family (1-2 plus 4-6 clawed kadian spawn), cemetery (3-6 plus 11-20 clawed kadian spawn)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>A clawed kadian is a ghostlike creature whose spirit is still grounded in the physical world, allowing it to grasp corporeal creatures. However, this trait also leaves the kadian vulnerable to attacks from bludgeoning weapons.</p>
<p>Paladins and pirates alike fear these spectral women.</p>
<p>This type of undead can be made with a <i>greater create undead</i> spell of caster level 18th or higher.</p>

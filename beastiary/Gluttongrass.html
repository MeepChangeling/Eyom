<p>A patch of gluttongrass attacks with three frondsâthese are primary <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks">natural attacks</a> that deals slashing damage.</p>
<p>When gluttongrass damages a creature that can be affected by its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> attack, the gluttongrass has 1 hit point restored. If a creature is already suffering from a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed">bleed</a> effect, the gluttongrass instead has 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> restored for each successful frond attack.</p>

<p>Scholars are unsure of the origins of this strange, deadly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> life. The typical suspicions persist that it is the result of a mad <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizardâs</a> experiments or the deliberate cultivations of druidic sects that have adopted anticivilization philosophies, yet those who have taken the time to truly examine these blood-drinking growths have noted disturbing elements that suggest a darker <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/genesis">genesis</a>.</p>
<p>These botanists theorize that gluttongrass is seeded by the remnants of a creature that has died from starvation, whether in the wilds or in more urban territories. Indeed, patches of gluttongrass have been discovered flourishing in areas devastated by famine and around settlements whose populations have perished due to food supplies being cut off (such as in times of siege or after raiders have burned local crops). However, it has also been identified growing seemingly at random throughout forested areas and plains, blending in with normal grasses and other foliage, so certainly famine and starvation are not requirements for this <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plantâs</a> growth.</p>
<p>Whatever its origin, one thing is certain: while a mindless <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a>, gluttongrass is far from harmless.</p>
<p>Well-fed patches of this carnivorous grass average a height of 5 feet, with razor-sharp stalks able to pierce exposed skin with ease. Wary travelers should avoid rushing blindly through tall fields, as smaller patches of gluttongrass have been known to extend their roots toward one another, merging and slowly increasing their collective size, reach, and hunger. Some of the largest gluttongrass fields are suspected to have claimed hundreds of victims over the years.</p>Gluttongrass Field
<p>The thing that makes gluttongrass so dangerous when encountered as a field is the simple fact that the plants merge and link their root systems once enough of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> monsters take root in close proximity. If at least 12 gluttongrasses take root in a single contiguous area, their roots begin to commingle. As long as the gluttongrasses do not move from their locations for at least 24 hours, this process completes and the carnivorous plants merge into a gluttongrass field.</p>

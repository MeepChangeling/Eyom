<h1>Vorvorak</h1>
<p class="description">A crocodilian head surmounts this creature’s draconic body. Thick scales cover its mottled brown and green hide, and a muscular tail sways menacingly behind it.</p>

<p>A vorvorak’s tail seems to have a mind of its own. If a vorvorak does not take a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> on its turn, it can make a tail slap attack as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>. In addition, the vorvorak can make one extra <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a> each round, but this extra attack must be its tail slap. It can make this additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a> (but not its normal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attack of opportunity</a>) even when <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed">flat-footed</a>.</p>

<p>Vorvoraks are large, intelligent crocodilians with shadowy magical powers. These reclusive creatures most often make their lairs in abandoned canals. More commonly known as “<em>canal dragons</em>” or “<em>brown dragons</em>,” vorvoraks are unrelated to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon">true dragons</a> and lack the many abilities and resistances of those more famous creatures. Even so, vorvoraks present a danger to those who intrude upon their claimed territories.</p>
<p>A vorvorak’s body is roughly the shape of a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragon</a>, while its head is that of a crocodile. What can appear at first to be wings on its back are in fact a pair of hard fins. A vorvorak’s scales are usually muddy brown in color, occasionally accented with moss-green spots or stripes. An average vorvorak is 24 feet long from nose to tail and weighs around 3,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Vorvoraks exert power over the water around them, allowing them to raise or lower its level, produce mist, and, most impressively, eject large quantities of water mixed with their own poisonous bile. Vorvoraks also seem to demonstrate mastery of multiple manifestations of magic-such as altering matter, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Summoning">summoning</a> creatures, and creating explosions of energy-but these abilities are mere illusions, containing the barest shadow of reality. Vorvoraks use their magic to attract prey, conceal their lairs, and deter trespassers in their territory. Though these shadowy illusions have a chance of damaging opponents in combat, they more often serve as distractions that allow vorvoraks to position themselves for full attacks.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Vorvoraks are solitary hunters, most active at dawn and dusk. Though generally associated with disused canal system, a few make their lairs in natural gullies. A natural or burrowed niche provides the beasts a place to sleep and store treasure. Often the entrances to vorvoraks’ lairs are partially submerged; otherwise, a vorvorak hides the entrance with an <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> when it leaves to hunt. Vorvoraks feed mostly on creatures that live in or near canals, as well as the occasional domestic animal that wanders into their range. Its few sentient victims tend to be unlucky lost travelers who attempt to follow the old canals back to civilization.</p>
<p>Like dragons, vorvoraks line their lairs with treasures. In addition to coins and jewels taken from humanoid victims, vorvorak hoards are likely to contain common artifacts. These treasures may come from nearby ruins of abandoned estates, but just as often the beasts find them buried in the sediment at the bottom of a canal. Vorvoraks keep even broken or tarnished treasures, using illusions to make these items appear new.</p>
<p>When vorvoraks meet, it’s usually to fight over territory. The only time the creatures seek each other out is when driven to mate, which occurs only once or twice per decade, usually after a particularly heavy rain. The pair stays together only long enough to conceive, after which the female lays her eggs in the deepest water in her territory. Young vorvoraks that survive their first 2 or 3 years are “encouraged” to find their own territory as soon as their mother’s hunger or jealousy overcomes her maternal instincts.</p>
<p>Though they avoid active waterways, vorvoraks occasionally clash with humanoids. This usually occurs when a young vorvorak seeking territory moves too close to a civilized area or when enterprising locals attempt to reclaim lands around abandoned canals. In the centuries since, few have seen a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon">true dragon</a>, and they could easily mistake a vorvorak for one. Would-be dragon slayers, seeking to emulate the heroes of old, hunt vorvoraks for glory and treasure. A common (and likely apocryphal) story tells of simple villagers who mistook a vorvorak for a spawn of the Tarrasque-until a traveling priest subdued the monster and led it into the town square. Ashamed of their terrible judgment and cowardice, the villagers soon converted to the priest’s religion (which varies according to the story’s teller).</p>

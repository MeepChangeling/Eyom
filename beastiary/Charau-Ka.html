<h4><span id="Shrieking_Frenzy_Su">Shrieking Frenzy (Su)</span></h4>
<p>Once per day, a charau-ka can enter a state of shrieking frenzy as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. While in this state, the charau-ka automatically fails <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a> (or use items that require command words to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Activate-Magic-Item">activate</a>), but functions as if under the effects of a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> spell. The charauka can continue shrieking for up to 3 rounds, after which it is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered">staggered</a> for 1 round.</p>
<h4><span id="Thrown-Weapon_Mastery_Ex">Thrown-Weapon Mastery (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka gain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/throw-anything-combat">Throw Anything</a> as a bonus feat. In addition, a charau-ka gains a +1 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on all thrown weapons, and their threat range for thrown weapons is doubled, as if the charau-ka possessed the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-critical-combat-">Improved Critical</a> feat for all thrown weapons. This effect doesnât stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.</p>

<p>Although they call themselves the charau-ka, these dangerous jungle dwellers are often known to colonists and explorers as ape-men. Legend holds that the charau-ka stem from a demon lord who transformed the bodies of the first humans that tried to wage war against his cult, causing the dead to rise as the first apemen. Rumors that charau-ka <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">clerics</a> have perfected a hideous ritual to force those slain to reincarnate as new charau-ka are popular tales among jungle explorersâbut proof of such a magic spell has yet to reach civilization.</p>
<p>Today, the charau-ka are one of the most fecund and widespread races.</p>
<p>Charau-ka generally dwell in small tribes of a few dozen members. They often keep dangerous jungle creatures as pets or guardians, trusting to their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druids</a> or animal handlers to keep the deadly beasts under control. A typical charau-ka village extends from the jungle floor up into the canopy above, and usually includes several treehouse-style structures connected by vines or rope bridges.</p>

<p class="source"><b>Source</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/160125752X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=160125752X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&amp;linkId=AKZJFVX4SEMW6HO3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PCS:ISMC</a></p>
<p>While charau-ka can be encountered alone, they typically travel with other simians as either a hunting party or an entire tribe, using superior numbers against whatever quarry they find in the wilderness. Hunting parties may include as few as two hunters or as many as eight. When a charau-ka tribe traverses the jungle, members move in hooting and whooping groups ranging from 12 to 25 adults, attempting to panic outnumbered enemies before overwhelming them. As many as three lieutenant warriors lead the attack, supported by a demon-worshiping <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">cleric</a> and directed by a powerful and experienced chief who commands up to three <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/primates/primate-dire-ape">dire apes</a>. Charau-ka pelt opponents into submission with rocks expertly thrown from trees above their targets, and with a gesture by their leader, they disappear into the foliage in an instant. Fiercely territorial, they respond to any sizable incursion on their hunting grounds and engage any group deemed weak enough to defeat.</p>
<p>Charau-ka attack as a pack, aiming to separate the weakest target from a group of enemies. They focus their assault to subdue opponents one at a time in order of perceived frailty. Should their foes respond with powerful magic or potent physical attacks, they disappear into the jungle and wait for another chance for an ambush. Tribal leaders allow infighting only when within range of a blood totem; as a prelude to internal conflicts, lieutenants often attempt to capture powerful opponents and force them to battle for sport in front of the charau-ka before challenging the chief for leadership of the tribe.</p>

<p>The charau-ka litter the jungles with traps, imperiling unwitting travelers. The following are but a sampling of the devious traps they devise throughout their jungle territories.</p>
<p class="title">Blood Totem’s Gaze <span style="text-align: right">CR 9</span></p>
<p><b>Type</b> magic; <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> DC 21; <b>Disarm</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> DC 21</p>
<p><b>Trigger</b> visual (<a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-eye">arcane eye</a>); <b>Duration</b> 1 minute; <b>Reset</b> automatic (1 hour); <b>Effect</b> totem gains a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> attack with a range of 30 ft.; targets affected by the gaze suffer the effects of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/moonstruck">moonstruck</a> (target gains 2 claws and a bite attack and is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> for 1 round, then attacks nearest creatures for 7 rounds; <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 16 negates); multiple targets (all creatures susceptible to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-">gaze</a> attacks within 30 ft.)</p>
<p>Blood totems are stone fetishes, often depicting apes, charau-ka, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magical-beasts/girallon">girallons</a>; they’re designed to scare intruders away from charau-ka territory. Some blood totems are magically treated to send trespassers into a frenzy.</p>
<p class="title">Demonic Chime <span style="text-align: right">CR 4</span></p>
<p><b>Type</b> magic; <b>Notice</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> DC 25; <b>Disarm</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> DC 18</p>
<p><b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Reset</b> none; <b>Effect</b> spell effect (sonic scream, 4d4 points of sonic damage on 1st round, 2d4 points of sonic damage on 2nd round, 1d4 points of sonic damage on 3rd round, each round <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 13 half); multiple targets (all targets in a 15-ft. cone)</p>
<p>Demonic chimes serve the charau-ka both as weaponized defenses and alarms, and the hysterical simian shrieks of a triggered chime can be heard up to 1 mile away.</p>
<p class="title">Exploding Monkey Tree <span style="text-align: right">CR 3</span></p>
<p><b>Type</b> magic; <b>Notice</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> DC 23; <b>Disarm</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> DC 23</p>
<p><b>Trigger</b> proximity; <b>Reset</b> none; <b>Effect</b> monkey tree oil (creatures gain a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> checks to track target for 24 hours); multiple targets (all targets in a 30-ft. radius)</p>
<p>This trap uses alchemical explosives to burst the trunk of a monkey tree when a creature moves past it. Monkey tree oil is extremely foul and allows charau-ka trackers to more easily detect prey that have triggered the trap.</p>
<p class="title">Hydrophobia Bomb <span style="text-align: right">CR 4</span></p>
<p><b>Type</b> mechanical; <b>Notice</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> DC 23; <b>Disarm</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> DC 23</p>
<p><b>Trigger</b> touch; <b>Reset</b> none; <b>Effect</b> Atk +10 ranged (target gains a phobia against water, Will DC 14 negates); multiple targets (all creatures in a 20-ft. radius)</p>
<p>This explosive is filled with a concoction of dead brainworms and digested <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/boggard">boggard</a> brains that causes a dire fear of water in creatures within the blast radius.</p>
<p class="title">Sanguine Sack Trap <span style="text-align: right">CR 4</span></p>
<p><b>Type</b> mechanical; <b>Notice</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> DC 20; <b>Disarm</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> DC 20</p>
<p><b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Reset</b> none; <b>Effect</b> exploding pouch of blood (gore imposes â8 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth">Stealth</a> checks against creatures with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent">scent</a> for 10 minutes, doubles target’s detectable range, and grants the benefits of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/grease">grease</a> to the target; <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> DC 20 negates); multiple targets (all targets in a 10-ft. square)</p>
<p>This trap features an exploding sack of gore. Those coated in the rotting offal are easier for predators with the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-">scent</a> ability to detect.</p>
<p class="title">Wrecked Menhir Circle <span style="text-align: right">CR 6</span></p>
<p><b>Type</b> magical; <b>Notice</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception">Perception</a> DC 26; <b>Disarm</b> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> DC 26</p>
<p><b>Trigger</b> location; <b>Reset</b> none; <b>Effect</b> spell effect (<a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/murderous-command">murderous command</a>, targets attack the nearest ally, Will DC 12 negates); multiple targets (all targets in a 50-ft. radius)</p>

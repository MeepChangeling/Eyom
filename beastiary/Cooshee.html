<p>Cooshees are large, 200-pound, 4-foot tall hounds. They are known throughout the world as elven dogs, for their features resemble those of elves and they are often found in the employ of elves (who use them as guards). Though they only bark to warn their masters or other cooshees, the bark can be heard clearly up to one mile away.</p>
<p>Cooshees attack by biting and tripping their foes. Once down, an opponent is grappled and bitten.</p>

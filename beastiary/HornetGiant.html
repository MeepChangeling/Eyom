<p>Giant hornets are larger, more aggressive versions of normal hornets. They are generally inoffensive if left alone, but if provoked, become very deadly opponents. Giant hornets have a society structure consisting of two distinct classes: workers and the queen.</p>
<p>Workers spend their time pulling nectar from flowers and carrying it to the nest where they feed the young, the queen, and the other hornets. They are also the hornets involved in defending the nest and queen from attack. When aggressors are detected within 100 feet of the nest, the workers fly out and patrol the area. Creatures that move within 20 feet are attacked.</p>
<p>The queenâs sole purpose is to lay eggs that ultimately hatch and grow into new hornets. She has no stinger and does not attackâworkers kill most aggressors long before they reach the queen. Giant hornet builds its nest high above the ground in much the same way a standard wasp does. A giant hornetâs nest has a curved flare at the top.</p>
<p>Giant hornets attack by biting their foes, only relying on its stinger when threatened. During combat, it releases a pheromone that agitates all other giant hornets in the area, making them more aggressive.</p>

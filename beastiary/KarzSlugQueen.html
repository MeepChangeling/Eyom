<p class="title">Karz Slug Queen <span class="level">CR 12</span></p>
<p class="description">This orange, horned slug is similar to the others but far larger, easily double or triple the size of the lesser gastropods that crawl and undulate around it.</p>

<p><b>Before Combat</b> Karz slug queens rarely engage enemies without reinforcements nearby.</p>
<p><b>During Combat</b> A karz slug queen uses <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/power-attack/">Power Attack</a> (taking no penalty to its first attack on its turn) after unleashing its psionic force ability. Otherwise it coordinates its thralls with tactical precision.</p>
<p><b>Morale</b> Karz slug queens retreat when reduced to 20 hp or less. When a karz slug queen is killed, any remaining <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/karz-slug/">karz slugs</a> that were offspring of it immediately die as a result of their psionic connection.</p>

<h4><span id="Den_Haste_Ex">Den Haste (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>When encountered within a karz slug breeding den, a karz slug queen gains the benefits of a constant extraordinary effect identical to the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste">haste</a> spell.</p>
<h4><span id="Karz_Slime_Ex">Karz Slime (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Karz slug queens are covered in a thick layer of translucent amber slime. A karz slug queen can spit slime as a ranged attack at a target up to 60 ft. way, or slather with a successful melee attack (as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>). Karz slime is a fast acting <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> and is immediately absorbed into a creatureâs skin upon contact. The slime remains poisonous for four rounds after a creature comes into contact with it and at the start of its turn a creature affected by it must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> saving throw to negate its effects. After four rounds the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> is neutralized and the karz slime is annoying but harmless.</p>
<p>For the initial two rounds of exposure the slime causes amnesia (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 25), for the last two effective rounds exposure to the slime causes paranoia (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 22). If a target fails any of these saving throws it remains affected by the relevant slime effects until the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> is cured by magical means such as the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a> spell. If a target is affected by any of these effects for longer than 24 hours they also suffer from psychosis (no saving throw; insanity DC 20) until the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> is cured by magical means. If a target is affected by any of these effects for longer than a week, the effects become permanent.</p>
<h4><span id="Lunge_Ex">Lunge (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slug queenâs lunge attack has a reach of 20 feet. After a lunge attack the karz slug queen moves from its previous square to the square nearest its intended target.</p>
<p>This movement is considered a part of its attack and not factored into its movement rate.</p>
<h4><span id="Malleable_Ex">Malleable (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slug queenâs body is very malleable, allowing it to fit into narrow areas with ease. A karz slug takes no penalties to its speed or checks when squeezing in an area that is one size category smaller than its actual size.</p>
<h4><span id="Psionic_Camouflage_Su">Psionic Camouflage (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slug queen has the ability to project itself (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a>) as an environmental element. This is a psionic mind-altering effect (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 30). Karz slug queens most commonly use this ability to hide themselves when they flee from combat.</p>
<h4><span id="Psionic_Force_Su">Psionic Force (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slug queen can emit a psionic force that functions exactly as the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/crushing-hand">crushing hand</a> (CL 20th). To initiate this effect the karz slug queen spends one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a> and sacrifices 2d12 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a>. This effect cannot be used when the karz slug queen is at half <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> or less.</p>
<h4><span id="Psionic_Lure_Su">Psionic Lure (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slug queen has the ability to project itself (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a>) as any other Medium-sized creature it has encountered. This is a psionic mind-altering effect (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> DC 30). As an intelligent creature a karz slug can tell the difference between various creatures, and may choose to work together with other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/karz-slug/">karz slugs</a> to manifest a projected scenario that is more likely to attract prey. While karz slug queens do not understand language, their projections can repeat phrases in any language that it has overheard.</p>
<h4><span id="Susceptible_to_Heat_Ex">Susceptible to Heat (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A karz slug queen takes double damage fire. Its slime is semi-flammable and has a 5% chance of combustion when exposed to an open flame. If a karz slug queenâs slime combusts, it kills that slug immediately. If exposed to excessive heat or fire there is a 5% chance that a karz slug queen instinctively flees for 1d4 rounds, though she does not flee from within the breeding den.</p>
<h4><span id="Susceptible_to_Salt_Ex">Susceptible to Salt (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A handful of salt burns a karz slug queen as if it were a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Flask">flask</a> of acid, causing 1d4 points of damage per handful.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary (in the company of 18â54 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/karz-slug/">karz slugs</a>)<br/><b>Treasure</b> unique (karz slug queen gland)</p>
<p>Karz slug queens never voluntarily leave their breeding dens once they have established them. A breeding den consists of 1â4 broods of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/karz-slug/">karz slugs</a> in addition to the queen, three quarters of which always remain in the den to protect the queen at any given time. When encountered within a breeding den, the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/karz-slug/">karz slugs</a> protecting the queen become hostile. Half surround her, attacking anything that comes within reach, and the other half engage and pursue the intruders.</p>
<p>Karz slug queens are as mysterious as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/karz-slug/">karz slugs</a>, but larger; they can stand up to 10 ft. in height and weigh between 1,500 and 1,800 pounds.</p>
<h3><span id="Karz_Slug_Queen_Gland">Karz Slug Queen Gland</span></h3>
<p>A karz slug queen has a gland located near its core that enable its natural psionic abilities. If removed from the dead queen, dried, and properly prepared (48 hours and a DC 25 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft">Craft</a> [magic items] check) it becomes consumable.</p>
<p>When properly prepared and eaten it provides the user with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-">immunity</a> to all mind-altering effects and a grants +3 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Bonus-Alchemical-">alchemical bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throws for 2d4 days. A prepared karz slug queen gland is eye-wateringly sour with a sickeningly sweet aftertaste.</p>
<p>A karz slug queen gland permanently removes any mind-affecting effects that the user may have been affected by before consumption (as well as all types of insanity).</p>

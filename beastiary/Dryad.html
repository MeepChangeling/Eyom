<h4><span id="Tree_Meld_Su">Tree Meld (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/dryad">dryad</a> can meld with any tree, similar to how the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/meld-into-stone" rel="nofollow">meld into stone</a> functions. She can remain melded with a tree as long as she wishes.</p>
<h4><span id="Tree_Dependent_Su">Tree Dependent (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A dryad is mystically bonded to a single, enormous tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Most dryad trees are oak trees, but other trees function as well (often having subtle influences on a specific dryad’s personality and appearance). A dryad who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded tree immediately becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened">sickened</a>. Every hour thereafter, she must make a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to resist becoming <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated">nauseated</a> for an hour. A dryad that is out of range of her bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>, and another 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a> every day that followsâeventually, this separation kills the dryad. A dryad can forge a new bond with a new tree by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save.</p>
<h4><span id="Wild_Empathy_Su">Wild Empathy (Su)</span></h4>
<p>This works like the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-">wild empathy</a> class feature, except the dryad has a +6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> on the check. Dryads with <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid</a> levels add this racial modifier to their <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-">wild empathy</a> checks.</p>
<h4><span id="Woodcraft_Ex">Woodcraft (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A dryad has a +6 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus">racial bonus</a> to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft" rel="nofollow">Craft</a> checks involving wood, and is always treated as if she had masterwork artisan’s woodworking tools when making such checks.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or grove (3â8)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/dagger">dagger</a>, masterwork <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longbow">longbow</a> with 20 arrows, other treasure)</p>
<p>Dryads are tree-<a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey">fey</a> who prefer secluded woodlands far from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid">humanoids</a> in need of lumber. Dryads’ main interests are their own survival and that of their beloved forests, and they have been known to magically coerce passersby into aiding them in tasks they cannot complete. They are more likely to be friendly to non-evil <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druids</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">rangers</a>, as they recognize a mutual respect for or empathy with nature.</p>

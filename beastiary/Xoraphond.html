<h4><span id="Anesthetizing_Touch_Ex">Anesthetizing Touch (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a xoraphond may execute a single melee <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch attack</a> to deliver an anesthetizing slime to a potential victim. If successful, the slime paralyzes the target for one round-long enough for a xoraphond to infect a creature with its chosen <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> (see below). A creature which succeeds at a DC 15 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save negates this effect. This is a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> effect and the save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Disease_Ex">Disease (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>The xoraphond’s alien masters engineered it to carry a variety of nanite-based diseases and retroviruses, all designed to support its mission of infecting, weakening, and eventually assimilating a world’s sentient population. As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, a xoraphond can transmit a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> carried in its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/aberrant">aberrant</a> flesh to a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless">helpless</a> creature by extending a pseudopod into any orifice or open wound. Those victimized by this assault can resist the resulting infection with a successful DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the effects of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> vary according to the exact infection it carries. Some examples are given below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assimilation Strain</strong>: Anesthetizing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>-contact; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 16; onset 1 day; <i>frequency</i> 1/day; <i>effect</i> 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Cha</a> damage (cannot reduce below 1), if more than 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Cha</a> damage, target must make a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or change <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> one step towards evil and gain the assimilated template; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive saves.</li>
<li><strong>Occluding Strain</strong>: Anesthetizing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>-contact; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 16; onset immediate; <i>frequency</i> 1/day; <i>effect</i> 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Str</a> damage (cannot reduce below 1), if more than 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Str</a> damage, target must make an additional <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> save or be permanently <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded">blinded</a>; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive saves.</li>
<li><strong>Submission Strain</strong>: Anesthetizing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>-contact; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 16; onset 1 day; <i>frequency</i> 1/day; <i>effect</i> 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Wisdom damage</a> (cannot reduce below 1), if more than 2 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wis</a> damage, target must make a DC 16 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save or suffer an additional 1d6 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage">nonlethal damage</a>; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive saves.</li>
<li><strong>Wasting Strain</strong>: Disease-Anesthetizing <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks">touch</a>; <i>save</i> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> DC 16; onset 1 day; <i>frequency</i> 1/day; <i>effect</i> 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Con</a> damage, target must make a second <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fort</a> save or 1 point of the damage is drain instead; <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive saves.</li>
</ul>
<p>A xoraphond automatically knows when it has successfully infected a creature, but can carry only one <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> at a time. Each day after resting for 24 hours, a xoraphond may organically alter its <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases">disease</a> to a different strain. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<h4><span id="Ooze_Empathy_Ex">Ooze Empathy (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a xoraphond can improve the attitudes of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a> with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check, similar to a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">druid’s</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-">wild empathy</a> ability. The xoraphond rolls 1d20 and adds its HD and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier to determine the empathy check result. Oozes typically have a starting attitude of Indifferent towards xoraphonds. To use this ability, the xoraphond and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">ooze</a> must be within 30 feet and capable of studying one another.</p>
<h4><span id="Vulnerable_to_Sonic_Attacks_Ex">Vulnerable to Sonic Attacks (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>Xoraphonds are vulnerable to sonic attacks and take half again as much damage (+50%) from such attacks. If a xoraphond takes sonic damage it must succeed on a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save (DC equal to the damage taken) or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed">dazed</a> for 1 round.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic">aquatic</a>, land, or underground<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, scouting party (3-8), or invasion (9-16)<br/><b>Treasure</b> standard (including technological gear)</p>
<p>One of many artificially engineered creatures manufactured by the jagladine, xoraphonds are designed to spread nanite viruses, particularly a dreaded assimilation strain intended to convert sentient creatures into new recruits for the jagladine war effort. This virus weakens the minds of sentient creatures, remapping and repurposing their brains for alien influence.</p>
<p>When the jagladine develop an interest in assimilating inhabitants of a new world, they often dispatch an invading force of xoraphonds, directing them to work independently and establish a stronghold from which to begin their mission of assimilation. A xoraphond’s resilience, ability to survive in hostile environments, and cautious, inquisitive nature makes it an exceptional scout and infiltrator.</p>
<p>Xoraphonds typically carry out their missions by abducting a hardy specimen from the local population, often using jagladine biotechnology to turn the creature into a willing thrall, before infecting it with the assimilation strain. The xoraphonds then direct such thralls to infect their own kind.</p>
<p>As the virus spreads, the xoraphonds study the new world and its other inhabitants, compiling a vast amount of data for their jagladine masters, while reacting swiftly to protect themselves and their missions-even directing thralls to slay interlopers and sow discord in their communities to hide their presence.</p>
<p>Unhindered by emotion, xoraphonds never hesitate to sacrifice thralls or any of their infected flock to ensure their survival and the success of their missions.</p>
<p>Creatures infected by a xoraphond’s assimilation strain carry thousands of microscopic tracker-nanites, dooming them to capture and experimentation by the sadistic jagladine in their alien bio-labs. There, the jagladine perform further tests on a candidate’s viability, before subjecting them to unspeakable procedures involving surgery, chemical infusion, radiation exposure, and psychological reconditioning. Most of these candidates are eventually transformed into a special breed of shock troop called klaven, however, the jagladine produce an array of other creatures from these vile assimilations, including new xoraphonds.</p>
<p>A newborn xoraphond oozes forth from its birthing vat completely autonomous and fully functional. Though xoraphonds are amorphous and can flatten themselves to form a bewildering number of forms, most prefer to remain in a roughly oval shape, about 4 feet in diameter and 3-1/2 feet tall.</p>
<p>Xoraphonds weigh around 90 pounds.</p>

<h1>Zombie, Void</h1>
<p class="description">This obviously deceased creature moves forward with disturbing speed, almost as disturbing as the purple-black, barbed tongue that extends from its misshapen skull. </p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Blood-Drain-Ex-"></a>Blood Drain (Ex)</h4>
<p>If a void zombie hits a living creature with its tongue attack, it drains blood, dealing 2 points of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> damage before the tongue detaches.</p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Quick-Strikes-Ex-"></a>Quick Strikes (Ex)</h4>
<p>Whenever a void zombie takes a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>, it can make one additional slam attack at its highest base attack bonus.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> any; usually in the vicinity of one or more <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/akata">akatas</a><br/> <b>Treasure</b> none </p>
<p>Those who perish while suffering from void death become void zombies. Within 2d4 hours of a carrierâs death, the strongest of the akata larvae infesting the corpse worms its way to the humanoidâs brain and undergoes a swift gestation. This accelerated growth causes the feeler-covered head of the over-sized, tadpole-like parasite to latch onto the base of its victimâs brain and reenergize the dying organ, taking total control. These parasite-possessed corpses are known as void zombies. As akata larvae are too large to fit wholly within the skulls of most humanoid races, these zombies have a distinctive appearance, with the fanged tail of the parasite bursting through its hostâs jaw, dangling forth from the broken skull.</p>

<h1>Skinwraith</h1>
<p> Campaign Role 
<p>Due to their unusual shape and consistency, skinwraiths can be placed in many places other monsters or undead cannot reside. In fact, skinwraiths can be encountered in almost any setting, even underwater or high in the air. Skinwraiths also combine easily with traps, as they can be folded up and placed in small confined spaces. They may be placed in treasure chests or in sacks as well: always a fun way to surprise the party.</p>

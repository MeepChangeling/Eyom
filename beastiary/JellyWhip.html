<p class="description">This creature looks like a squirming mass of bluish-gray slime with several long writhing tentacles protruding from its form. Veins of dark blue and black snake through its protoplasmic form.</p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Acid-Ex-"></a>Acid (Ex)</h4>
<p>A whip jelly secretes a deadly acid that quickly dissolves organic matter but does not harm metal or stone. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Non-metal armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save. A wooden weapon that strikes a whip jelly dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 14 Reflex save. The save DCs are <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>

<p>A whip jelly, like most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a>, is a mindless hunter that spends its time prowling the subterranean world for food. Rarely encountered near the surface, the deeper one goes in the Under Realms, the more likely an encounter with one of these creatures is to occur.</p>
<p>Whip jellies lair in darkened dry areas. They have a natural disdain for water (though it does not harm them in any way). Their lairs contain the remains of past meals and possibly any treasure or belongings (of a metallic nature) that the meal happened to be carrying at the time of its demise.</p>
<p>A whip jelly looks like a bluish-gray quivering pile of goo with four long slimy tendrils jutting from its form. The creature’s body is rather thick and resilient (hence the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus">natural armor bonus</a>, usually unheard of for ooze creatures). Its tendrils are a bit darker in color than its main body. Shoots of dark blue and black through its body give the appearance of veins.</p>
<p>A whip jelly attacks by whipping and striking its foes with its long slimy tentacles. A slain creature is slowly digested by the jelly over a period of days or weeks (ultimately depending on how hungry the creature is at the time).</p>

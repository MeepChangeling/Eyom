<p class="description">This very large spider has a bony black exoskeleton, white fangs dripping with poison, and eyes that glow with a hellish red light.</p>

<p>Ebon spiders are prone to charge into combat, trying to kill as many creatures as possible. Being intelligent, they prefer to attack spellcasters over armored opponents, using their Mobility and Spring Attack feats to keep their opponents off-balance.</p>

<h4><span id="Nightmare_Su"><a name="TOC-Nightmare-Su-"></a>Nightmare (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A creature that fails the secondary saving throw against an ebon spiderâs poison is subject to its nightmare effect. Once each year on the anniversary of the spiderâs attack, the creature lapses into a comatose state for 24 hours that is marked by sweating, uncontrollable shaking, and vivid dreams that recreate the attack in the mind of the victim. In addition, each time the creature finds itself in the domain of an ebon spider (marked by the massive webs of its dream), the creature suffers a -4 morale penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws. This mind-affecting fear effect can be removed by the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse">remove curse</a> spell or DC 25 <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/break-enchantment">break enchantment</a> spell cast within a number of days of the attack equal to the casterâs level. Afterwards, only a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle">miracle</a> or <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish">wish</a> spell is sufficient to remove the effect.</p>

<h4><span id="Profane_Infusion_Su"><a name="TOC-Profane-Infusion-Su-"></a>Profane Infusion (Su)</span></h4>
<p>An ebon spider is infused with profane energy, granting it a +4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus">profane bonus</a> on its AC and saving throws.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> temperate forests<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or cluster (2-5)<br/><b>Treasure</b> none</p>
<p>Ebon spiders are the bane of dark forests, twisting mazes, and underground tunnels. They are ruthless, intelligent hunters that despise all creatures that enter their territories, viewing them as food to be harvested. From time to time, they make deals with powerful, evil races to allow safe passage in exchange for food, gifts, or treasures. Their only known ally is the ebant.</p>
<p>The spiders have a bony black exoskeleton, granting them increased shielding against attacks. Most who see these creatures report them as appearing as very large spiders with white fangs that drip poison and eyes that glow with a hellish red light.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_Society"><a name="TOC-Habitat-Society"></a>Habitat &amp; Society</span></h3>
<p>Ebon spiders are ruthless hunters, prone to hit and run tactics, and adventurers will probably have to endure numerous encounters as they make their way into the forest.</p>
<p>Ebon spiders also take over underground caverns to use them as lairs, filling the corridors with webs that allow them easy access but hamper intruders. They likewise can inhabit a swamp or marsh, leaping out to attack creatures whose paths lead them to destruction.</p>

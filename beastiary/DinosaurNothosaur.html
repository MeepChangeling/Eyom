<h1>Dinosaur, Nothosaur</h1>
<p class="description">This long-necked reptile swims through the water propelled by four paddle-like feet, whipping a long and slender tail behind it as it gnashes its sharp, needle-like teeth.</p>

<p> Primeval Sea Creatures 
<p>The ocean is full of myriad life forms, as varied and specialized as those in any other environment. But not all sea creatures are the result of millennia upon millennia of continual evolution. Some found themselves perfectly suited for their roles as apex predators millions of years ago and have simply remained as such to the present day, presenting terrible threats to those creatures that cross them, from their natural prey to unsuspecting sailors who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. In most cases, these creatures are closely related to other waterborne animals, be they fish, reptiles, or mammals, and some even have distinctive similarities to primarily land-based creatures.</p>

<h1>Shriezyx</h1>
<p class="description">This oversized, eight-legged monstrosity stares ravenously from its three beady eyes, its gaping maw dripping with green venom.</p>

<h4><span id="Fear_of_Fire_Ex"><a name="TOC-Fear-of-Fire-Ex-"></a>Fear of Fire (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A shriezyx within 30 feet of a fire the size of a torch or larger becomes <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> as long as it remains within that range. If damaged by fire, a shriezyx must make a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> save (DC equals the amount of fire damage dealt) or become <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened">frightened</a> for 1 round.</p>

<p>A shriezyx’s web is coated with a supernatural toxin that numbs and deadens the nerves on contact. Any creature struck by a shriezyx’s web must succeed at a DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save or become slowed (as the slow spell) for 1 minute. Each round, a victim may attempt a new DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save to end the effect early. This toxin fades quickly from spun websâit can only affect targets on the round the web is spun. Existing webs remain sticky and tangled, but do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-">Constitution</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any<br/> <b>Organization</b> solitary, pair, or hive (3â12)<br/> <b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Devised by a cabal of ancient <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a> to serve as guardians for monuments and laboratories, shriezyx are horrific spiderlike <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aberration">aberrations</a> created in arcane vats out of the flesh of many different creatures. Having outlived their creators, they continue to lurk in ruins, caves, and the deep places of the world, spreading far beyond the original city where they were created.</p>
<p>Shriezyx have no natural place in the ecology, but easily fill the niche of any predator of comparable strength. They can subsist on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/rat/rat-common">rats</a> and other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin">vermin</a> for long periods of time, but relish the opportunity for a more substantial meal. Derros, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-drow">drow</a>, and other subterranean races sometimes use them as guards or mounts, or subject them to torturous experimentation. These races use bribes of food and the threat of fire to keep the creatures in line.</p>
<p>Shriezyx can reproduce with their own kind or lay unfertilized eggs that hatch into identical copies of their parent. Eggs remain viable for years, hatching after exposure to water, fresh air, or consistent warmth. A typical shriezyx is 3 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.</p>

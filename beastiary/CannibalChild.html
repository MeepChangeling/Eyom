<h1>Cannibal Child</h1>
<p><i>You follow the faint crying for several yards before you see the source: an abandoned child, a toddler really. He sits on the ground, sobbing and unkempt. The child starts at your arrival, a combination of fear and hope in his light blue eyes. His crying subsides, and he holds his arms out to you. How could you resist? Gently, you take the lost little one into your arms.</i></p>
<p><i> “Are you hungry?” you say.</i></p>
<p><i> The boy’s brow furrows, and his mouth opens impossibly wide. Pain tears through your shoulders as the child’s fingers sink into your flesh. Suddenly it looks like it’s going to be a bad day.</i></p>

<h4><a name="TOC-Devour-Flesh-Su-"></a>Devour Flesh (Su)</h4>
<p> When a cannibal child makes a successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple">grapple</a> check, it inflicts claw damage as normal plus it literally inhales flesh from its victim, stripping the tissue away with its supernatural inhalation. The victim suffers 2d3+4 points of damage and wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. A DC 14 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude">Fortitude</a> save halves the damage and negates the wracking pains. Otherwise, the pains last until the victim recovers <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points">hit points</a> lost due to this ability. </p>

The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based. </p>
<h4><a name="TOC-Vulnerability-to-Silver-Su-"></a>Vulnerability to Silver (Su)</h4>
<p> A cannibal child takes half again as much damage (+50%) from silver weapons. This increase only applies to the base weapon damage itself, including <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus">enhancement</a> bonuses, but does not apply to additional damage from other sources such as high <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-">Strength</a> or sneak attack. </p>

<p> The cannibal child isn’t really a cannibal or a child. It’s an undead horror that relies on its ability to disguise itself as a lost child to lure prey into its deadly clutches. Scholars believe that in life cannibal children were people of exceptional greed or gluttony. They put their own selfish appetites ahead of everything and everyone, and so incurred a terrible curse after death.</p>
<p> A cannibal child prefers to attack by surprise, especially against someone whose trust it has earned. A cannibal child often ingratiates itself to its victim via the enchanting power of its gaze. Despite its small size, a cannibal child possesses great strength. It latches on to its prey with its claws and then uses its horrible devour flesh ability to inflict ghastly wounds.</p>

<p>Churrs are savage ape-like creatures found in heavily forested areas. They are fairly intelligent, standing 8 feet tall and have great reach. Some churrs are known to use primitive clubs or fashion spears with which to hunt. Churrs are omnivorous, eating fresh game as well as fruits and vegetable matter.</p>
<p>In rare instances, stone-aged tribes have been known to adopt churr as guardians, teaching them sign language and a few words, which they can repeat with a guttural accent that takes some time and practice to understand. Churr may cross breed with most humanoid and ape species making them a âmissing linkâ or bridge species. Their progeny are often somewhat smaller but more intelligent, having full linguistic capacity.</p>
<p>Evil bands of churr are known to kidnap humanoids to use as slaves for collecting fruit and delousing purposes. Such slaves are kept until such time as they have enraged the churr and it decides to eat it.</p>
<p>A churr stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Churrs speak a bastardized form of Giant.</p>

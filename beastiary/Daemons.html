<p>Daemons flourish upon the plane of Abaddon, a bleak expanse of cold mists, fearful shapes, and hunted souls. Upon these wastes, the souls of evil mortals flee predation by the native fiends, and terror and the powers of the evil plane eventually transform the most ruthless into daemons themselves. Amid these scarred wastelands, poison swamps, and realms of endless night rise the foul domains of the tyrants of daemonkind, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Lords of devastation, these powerful and unique daemons desire slaughter, ruin, and death on a cosmic scale, and drive hordes of their lesser kin to spread terror and sorrow across the planes. Although the Horsemen share a singular goal, their tactics and ambitions vary widely.</p>
<p>Along with mastery over vast realms, the Horsemen are served by unimaginably enormous armies of their lesser brethren, but are obeyed most closely by retinues of daemons enslaved to their titles. These specific strains of daemonic servitors, known among daemonkind as deacons, serve whoever holds the title of Horseman. Although these instruments of the archdaemons differ in strength and ability, their numbers provide their lords with legions capable of near-equal terrorization. More so than among any other fiendish race, several breeds of daemons lust after souls. While other foul inhabitants of the planes seek the corruption and destruction of living essences, many daemons value possession and control over mortal animas, entrapping and hoarding soulsâand in so doing disrupting the natural progression of life and perverting the quintessence of creation to serve their own terrible whims. While not all daemons possess the ability to steal a mortal beingâs soul and turn it to their use, the lowliest of daemonkind, the maniacal cacodaemons, endlessly seek life essences to consume and imprison. These base daemons enthusiastically serve their more powerful kin, eager for increased opportunities to doom mortal spirits. While cacodaemons place little value upon the souls they imprison, greater daemons eagerly gather them as trophies, fuel for terrible rites, or offerings to curry the favor of their lords. Several breeds of daemons also posses their own notorious abilities to capture mortal spirits or draw upon the power of souls, turning the forces of utter annihilation to their own sinister ends.</p>
<h3><span id="The_Four_Horsemen"><a name="TOC-The-Four-Horsemen"></a>The Four Horsemen</span></h3>
<p>Four dread lords, infamous across all the planes, rule the disparate hordes of daemonkind. Risen from among the ranks of their terrible brethren to displace those fiendish tyrants before them, they are the archdaemons, the End Bringers, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In the blasphemous annals of fiendish lore, they are the prophesied architects of multiversal ruin, destined to stand triumphant over cadaverous cosmoses and infinities of silence before also giving way to absolute oblivion. Undisputed in his power among their kind, each Horseman rules a vast realm upon the bleak plains of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a> and a distinctive method of mortal ruin: pestilence, famine, war, or death from old age. Yet while each archdaemon commands measureless influence, daemons know nothing of loyalty and serve only those they cannot overcome. Thus, though the Horsemen stand peerless in their power and manipulations among daemonkind, they must ever defend their thrones from the machinations of ambitious underlings and the plots of other archdaemons.</p>
<p>Upon the poisonous expanses of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>, lesser daemonic peers carve petty fiefdoms and posture as lords, but despite their world-spanning intrigues, all bow before the Horsemenâthough most do so only grudgingly. Ancient myths also tell of a mysterious fifth Horseman, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/daemon-the-oinodaemon">the Oinodaemon</a>, though nearly all mention of such a creature has been scoured from the multiverse.</p>
<h3><span id="The_Soul_Trade"><a name="TOC-The-Soul-Trade"></a>The Soul Trade</span></h3>
<p>There are many different ways to capture souls. The most commonly used methods are spells like <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/soul-bind">soul bind</a> and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/trap-the-soul">trap the soul</a>, with the former imprisoning the soul of a newly dead creature and the latter trapping the soul of someone still alive. Other creatures, such as the undead called <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/devourer">devourers</a>, have their own innate methods of trapping souls, and likewise <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/hag-night">night hags</a> are capable of using a version of <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/soul-bind">soul bind</a> through their heartstones to capture the souls of those they torment, binding them in dark gems and selling them in planar markets. Still other creatures create magic items called soul jars, which mimic the effects of these spells.</p>
<p>Most methods of using souls extinguish them completely, consigning them to oblivion. In these cases, only the direct intervention of a deity can return them to lifeâand sometimes not even then, such as when the soul is specifically devoured by one of the Horsemen. Other methods bleed a fraction of a soulâs energies away, and while this method is far less powerful, some <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> capture other creatures for the sole purpose of entrapping them and milking their souls over a prolonged period of time, causing horrific agony for spans of months, years, or centuries before finally giving in to their own hunger and consuming what tattered fragments of soul remain.</p>
<p>Unconscionable as most of the universe considers these practices, trapped souls exist as a commodity replete with their own rampant underground economy, both within the evil-aligned planes and elsewhere. Most of these souls ultimately end up in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>, though buyers and markets can also be found in <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a>, the Abyss, Axis, and even the worlds of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1">Material Plane</a>, as evil spellcasters and item crafters can make great use of powerful souls in their dark rites. The economy is complex, with prices determined not only by the strength and power inherent in a given soul, but also according to each soulâs manner of death, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a> in life, and other criteria. These additional factors rarely influence their use in magical experiments unless a soul was particularly noteworthy, but as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> are happy to explain, the nature of a soul has everything to do with its unique flavor.</p>
<p><a name="soultrade-mindless-spirit"></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Mindless Spirits (10 gp)</b>: While itâs possible to capture the vital essences of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Vermin">vermin</a>, basic <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze">oozes</a>, and other such unthinking creatures, these paltry spirits are worth very little.</p>
<p><a name="soultrade-animal-spirit"></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Animal Spirits (25 gp)</b>: This category contains creatures of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animal</a>-level intelligence, whose spiritsâwhile presumably worth something to some deities, as reflected by the value of animal sacrificeâare rarely traded in the soul markets. In fact, though the existence of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animal</a> spirits is undeniably real, thereâs rampant debate in many societies over whether such things truly count as âsouls.â</p>
<p><a name="soultrade-basic-soul"></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Basic Soul (100 gp)</b>: This is the soul of a standard intelligent creatureâa commoner, a low-level adventurer, a sentient monster of low CR, or any of the other hordes of weak or mundane folk who live out their lives with a normal amount of pomp and excitement. This is the lowest category of souls which interests <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a>, who see <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animals</a> and other nonsentient creatures as hardly worth the time to destroy.</p>
<p><a name="soultrade-noteworthy-soul"></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Noteworthy Soul (500 gp)</b>: The souls of mid-level characters, rulers, famous or influential people, and other powerful, accomplished, and otherwise important people draw greater attention than basic souls, and drive bidding higher accordingly.</p>
<p><a name="soultrade-grand-soul"></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Grand Soul (1000â5000 gp)</b>: High-level characters, great heroes, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon">dragons</a>, powerful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aberration">aberrations</a>, and other such spirits of fabulous power and forceful personalities offer equally significant rewards to those who manage to contain their essences.</p>
<p><a name="soultrade-unique-soul"></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Unique Soul (priceless)</b>: For the truly unique soulsâthose of legendary figures, epic heroes, and other massive presencesâthere can be no going price. The unique sparks that live within these creatures are valuable beyond compare, and the frantic bidding (and backstabbing) that arises when one of these trapped spirits comes up for sale is the sort of thing fiends and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead">undead</a> wait thousands of years for, paying nigh-unimaginable prices for the right to consume or display such an artifact.</p>
<h3><span id="Using_Souls"><a name="TOC-Using-Souls"></a>Using Souls</span></h3>
<p>In addition to consuming them for the sheer joy of destruction, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> use souls to empower themselves, conduct strange experiments, construct their hideous domains, and moreâand mortal spellcasters have followed their lead. of these varied uses, the most common is the creation or recharging of magic items, using the life force contained in soul gems and other such vesselsâor drawn out of the victim directly at the moment of castingâto empower the magic being worked. In these cases, souls should be assigned values based on the categories presented here and then treated as material <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components">components</a>, reducing the gold expenditure necessary to cast the spell according to the soulsâ value. (Thus a spell that requires 400 gp to cast might instead cost 300 gp and a basic-level soul.) Souls used in this manner are consumed and destroyed utterly.</p>
<p>Souls are especially useful in the creation of intelligent items. In these cases, usually only one soul crystallizes as the intelligence embedded into the item, though other souls may be cannibalized in the itemâs creation. Item <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment">alignment</a>, item ability scores, and languages spoken by the item mirror those of the soul used to provide the itemâs intelligence. Scholars have long debated whether the intelligence in such an item is the soul used, or if the soul is destroyed and the intelligence is only patterned on itâthe implication being that recovered intelligent objects (especially of daemonic origin) might be destroyed in order to liberate the souls used in their construction. As instances of both have been reported over the centuries, the question remains open, though few adventurers are willing to destroy their prized weapons based on conjecture.</p>
<p>Beyond the means described above, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> have myriad additional means of trapping, keeping, and subsequently using souls for constructing permanent objects and effects, such as a liquid form of soul-stuff mixing multiple souls, a crystalline dust formed from soul gems, and even ink created from souls and used to write down the names of the doomed, imprisoning them in elaborate poems penned on the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemonsâ</a> own flesh. Something intrinsic in daemonic nature allows for this flexibility, as some of the same methods they routinely use fail spectacularly when attempted by non-daemons, including such creatures as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/hag-night">night hags</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/devourer">devourers</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/lich">liches</a>, and followers of some fiendish lords, who themselves possess a vested interest in exploiting some or all of these methods.</p>
<h3><span id="Daemonkind"><a name="TOC-Daemonkind"></a>Daemonkind</span></h3>
<p>While many claim to see absolute evil in the eons-spanning agendas of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Hell-Lawful-Evil-">Hell</a> or the unpredictable and unstoppable devastation of the Abyss, the features of immorality, depravity, and cruelty most truly shape the face of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>. The scions of this shattered realm know no ambitions but their own, no loyalty but that wrested from them by fear or pain, and no limitations in pursuing their most wicked desires. Some underestimate <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a>, viewing them as evil without form, with vague plots that fall short of diabolical schemes and constrain them from the boundless degeneracy of demonkind. In truth, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> might be viewed as embodying evil at its purest, free from the mandates and strictures of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil">devils</a>, possessed of greater vision and focus than <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon">demons</a>. They are embodiments of evil without concern for law or chaos, malice given thought and form.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> endure trials upon the plane of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>, facing mind-shattering torments and paradoxes that, over eons, imbue each with the fundamental traumas and timeless hatreds that epitomize daemonkind.</p>
<p><b>From the Mortal to the Eternal</b>: A daemonâs existence begins in shock, pain, fear, and desperation. Virtually every daemon begins by crawling <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddonâs</a> unforgiving soil as one of the hunted. The rare exceptions to this wretched beginning are often those mortals who, prior to death, worshiped one of the Horsemen and sealed a pact that condemned them to one of these unfathomably evil beingsâ clutchesâand even then, at least half of these depraved spirits are betrayed by their patrons and consumed outright. Only seldomly does a mortal of exceptional evil and foul potential gain a daemonâs interest. Such perverse spirits can hardly view such attention as a boon, though. Existence as one of the hunted is terrifying and generally swift, ending in a moment of horrific violence as the soul is consumed by the denizens of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>. Those elevated to serve as newly shaped <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> face prolonged trials of pain, maddening stints of gaslighting, and unimaginable cruelties. Over a span of ages, just as surely as the souls of the hunted are destroyed and digested, so are the souls of promising mortals warped and fractured into beings unrecognizable from the villains they once were. Either as one of the transcended hunted or a chosen spirit, once a soul becomes a daemon it typically turns to prey on other hunted, mercilessly reveling in its increased status, even though most are elevated only to the forms of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons/cacodaemon">cacodaemons</a>. Gradually, as time progresses in spans measured in centuries, new <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> integrate into the larger societies of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>. These less powerful fiends wander <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>, left to their own devices until gathered together and organized by their more powerful kindred, obeying out of fear or respect. To the masses of lesser daemonkind, structure and organization come with difficulty, but their superior brethren find that their loyalty can be purchased quite easily. The mantra endlessly whispered in the ears of lesser <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> is simple: âServitude brings safety and souls. Follow, obey, and feast.â In this way most lesser <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> fall under the sway of more powerful members of their kind.</p>
<p><b>The Existential Paradox</b>: Given most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemonsâ</a> origin among the souls of the hunted, coupled with their quasi-religious hatred of mortal life, an inherent paradox underlies all daemonic thought: that all things mortal must be obliterated, despite the fact that they themselves were once mortal. The reasons for this hatred of existence are as varied as the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> themselves, stemming from lives of grief and pain, terrible and unjust ends, heartbreak and wounded pride, and more. Regardless of how their hatred comes to be, most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> lock away any considerations of their former nature or musings on the roots of their anger, and ages of depravity and delusion scour their beings of anything recognizable as the creatures they were in life. Yet just as a gnarled willow grows from a tiny black seed, so does each daemon know its current being finds it roots in that which it most loathes. This core of self-loathing guides most <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> in their greatest profanities, allowing them to lash out at the living, spirits, other <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider">outsiders</a>, members of their own kind, and occasionally even themselves with a viciousness that translates into an absolute hatred of all things that live, once lived, or ever might live. Such makes them the ultimate nihilists, guiding them toward a vision of a silent multiverse, an endless realm devoid of life and which, in the end, even they will be absent from. Yet as much as it loathes all things, every daemon loathes itself a modicum less, and so each strives to be the last witness to a dead eternity.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/daemons">daemons</a> have a common goal: bringing death, destruction, and pain to mortals. They eat souls, and stop at nothing to sate their hunger for them. Daemons are not to be trifled with. The greater lords of the daemonsâthe deacons and the Four Horsemen themselvesâare almost never summoned. Whether this is because they force others to arrive in their place, or because they have somehow anchored themselves to the plane of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Abaddon-Neutral-Evil-">Abaddon</a>, none can say with certainty.</p>
<p>Daemons are immune to acid, death effects, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases">disease</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison">poison</a>, and all are vulnerable to good and/or silver weapons. They have resistance to cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10.</p>

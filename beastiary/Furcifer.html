<h4><span id="Deleriant_Aura_Ex">Deleriant Aura (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A furciferâs pollen induces euphoria and confusion, imposing a â2 penalty on <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throws on any creatures within 50 feet of the furcifer. Creatures immune to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> are immune to this effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Displacement_Su">Displacement (Su)</span></h4>
<p>A furciferâs illusory pollen constantly distorts its presence. It gains a 50% miss chance as if it had total <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a>. Unlike actual total <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment">concealment</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/displacement">displacement</a> does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-seeing">True seeing</a> reveals its true location and negates the miss chance, and creatures immune to illusions or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison">poison</a> are immune to this effect.</p>
<h4><span id="Tongue_Ex">Tongue (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>A furcifer can grab a foe with its tongue and draw the victim to its mouth. This tongue attack has a reach of 25 feet. The attack deals no damage but allows the furcifer to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-">grab</a> its target. A furcifer does not gain the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled">grappled</a> condition while using its tongue in this manner.</p>
<h4><span id="Utopia_Sp">Utopia (Sp)</span></h4>
<p>A furcifer is blessed with strange powers of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion">illusion</a> and can warp the world around it at will to seem idyllic and safe. This functions as a <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mirage-arcana">mirage arcana</a> spell, though the furciferâs simplistic intellect means it may create unusual or surreal illusions based on what its victims find appealing. Creatures in the affected area may recognize the landscape as unnatural with a successful DC 20 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will">Will</a> saving throw; otherwise, the furciferâs powers lull them into accepting the impossible. Affected creatures cannot recognize any natural hazards in the area, and the furcifer itself appears as something harmless within the affected area, such as a flower-covered hill, quaint home, or friendly <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal">animal</a>, making it effectively <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible">invisible</a>; if the furcifer attacks, it immediately breaks the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility">invisibility</a> effect but does not end the <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mirage-arcana">mirage arcana</a> effect. Creatures immune to illusions and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting">mind-affecting</a> effects are immune to this effect. The save DC is <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a>-based.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b> any forest<br/><b>Organization</b> solitary or pair<br/><b>Treasure</b> incidental</p>
<p>Standing as tall as a house and draped in intoxicating blossoms, the furcifer is a bizarre synthesis of reptile and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant">plant</a> born from enormous surges of positive energy. Despite their inviting, vibrant hides, furcifers are ravenous predators, capable of warping the world around them into almost any placid scene and concealing themselves from ordinary senses. These abilities make them extraordinary ambush predators, and parties of <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human">human</a>-sized travelers are easily picked off one by one from above thanks to the clever reptilian huntersâ long, prehensile tongues.</p>
<p>Lazy and patient, these large reptiles sometimes lull whole caravans into complacency, letting them linger in false wonderlands for days or weeks as the furcifer picks off its prey one at a time. Furcifers are cantankerous and stubborn, and dispense with all subtlety to pursue prey relentlessly if it escapes their illusory paradise.</p>
<p>Furcifers on average stand over 15 feet tall and 35 feet long thanks to their long, curled tails. Furcifers weigh up to 6-1/2 tons.</p>
<p>A primordial creature of incredible size and impressive innate magic, the furcifer blends reptile and plant features into the form of a deadly ambush hunter. With the frame of a massive, hunchbacked lizard, opposable claws on each limb, a long prehensile tail, and a bony crest to protect their neck, this vicious beast lacks little in comparison to other predators. Despite all this, furcifers are lazy and capricious, preferring to lie in wait and snatch smaller prey with their long, prehensile tongues. Their broad-set eyes can rotate independently, allowing them to look in multiple directions at once and constantly watch for other dangerous creatures.</p>
<p>Furcifers command impressive innate magic that allows them to cloak the world around them in a placid disguise. They have rudimentary psychic abilities and can read glimpses of whatever their prey finds inviting and harmless, and then spin those stolen images into a soft landscape. When confronting intelligent creatures, the beastsâ limited intellects sometimes result in surreal illusionsâsuch as fruit trees heavy with bunnies, rippling ponds sitting at angles in hillsides, or houses made from candyâ but the mind-numbing euphoria of their magic often makes such impossible landscapes feel sensible to their unsuspecting prey.</p>
<p>The orchid-like plants growing from the furciferâs back help further define their abilities. Rather than a symbiotic relationship, the blossoms are as much a part of the predatorâs anatomy as its eyes or claws, and they secrete a sweetly scented narcotic pollen that lulls most warmblooded animals into a mild euphoria.</p>
<p>The plants provide some sustenance to the furcifer but also produce a bevy of alchemical reagents that help power its magical abilities as well as its consumption. With the aid of these botanical factories, furcifers can digest practically anything they can swallowâ from rocks and debris to armor worn by their prey.</p>
<h3><span id="Habitat_and_Society">Habitat and Society</span></h3>
<p>Furcifers flourish in warm and temperate forests, as their cold-blooded nature and hothouse flower elements make them vulnerable to the cold. The resilient creatures could survive in desert and mountain environments if transplanted, limited only by available water and prey, but they rarely leave the familiar hunting grounds where they are born.</p>
<p>As asexual creatures, furcifers rely on pollinating insects for reproduction.</p>
<p>Once their blossoms are fertilized, they release their spore-like eggs into the wind, and those that settle on trees develop into small, carnivorous flowers that feed on their host trees and passing insects and birds for several years before maturing into miniature furcifers that begin hunting. The youngsâ first meals often consist of other larval furcifers that have yet to mature into their ambulatory states. On rare occasion, a single larval bloom will produce twin young, who bond and share their territory for life.</p>
<p>Infused with positive energy and strange alchemical reagents, furcifers are useful components for a variety of projects. Their pollen remains psychoactive for years after death, and the nectar harvested from a single beast can provides weeksâ worth of potent hallucinogens. Their bones are coveted for magic items involving acid, and their skin can be readily fashioned into cloaks and robes with illusory properties. The flesh itself is mildly toxic, and dead furcifers may rot slowly for months rather than be scavenged by other animals.</p>

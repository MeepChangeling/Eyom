<p>The City-state of Tano (also known as Tano) is a a member of the League of Gnollish Cities, a loose alliance of nations in north western Eyom which loosly function as part of a greater whole. Its predominantly <a href="..\cultures\gnoll.html">Gnollish</a> citizens live within its 56,083 km<sup>2</sup>, and primarily speak <a href="..\languages\Zräysian.html">Zräysian</a>.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="GovernmentAndPolitics">Government and Politics</h4>
<p>As with all of the gnollish city states, the City-state of Tano is ruled by a King or Queen. In Tano, the sovereign is descended from a noble bloodline, and supported by various bureaucratic organizations run by the common people. </br> </br> The ruling class of Tano are elected individuals drawn from the ranks of the common folk, with few exceptions. Their authority is relatively stable, with strong legitimacy, due to their current greatest asset, their firm economic control over the land. The largest issue currently facing Tano is a group of ministers are attempting to usurp power.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Millitary">Millitary</h4>
<p>The City-state of Tano's millitary is ahead of the curve for Eyom, with few problems and a few serious advantages. It favors a mixture of armored calvory and special forces, leaving its infantry as a rear guard. Tano uses airships in the conventional fashion, as troop transport and commandposts, but has been known to attempt to develop air-based artillery platforms from time to time. Tano's armed forces eschews magical solutions whenever possible. </br>  </br> The millitary favors a doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutual assured destruction">mutual assured destruction</a> in its millitary operations, but is willing and able to use others should the need arise. Tano's armed forces are almost all of its youths, who are required to serve as solgiers for a short piriod, with many remaining with the service as a form of career, which generaly view themselves as a caste of warriors appart from civilians who serve as Tano's shield, by enforcing the will of the people.  </br>  </br> Tano's millitary has roughly the following composision:<\p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total Troops:</b> 51331 (1% population)</li>
<li><b>Millitary Constructs:</b> 34905 (68% millitary)</li>

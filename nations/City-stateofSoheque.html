<p>The City-state of Soheque (also known as Soheque) is a a member of the League of Gnollish Cities, a loose alliance of nations in north western Eyom which loosly function as part of a greater whole. Its predominantly <a href="..\cultures\gnoll.html">Gnollish</a> citizens live within its 22,816 km<sup>2</sup>, and primarily speak <a href="..\languages\Zräysian.html">Zräysian</a>.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="GovernmentAndPolitics">Government and Politics</h4>
<p>As with all of the gnollish city states, the City-state of Soheque is ruled by a King or Queen. In Soheque, the sovereign is chosen by the common folk and serves at their pleasure, and supported by the banks. </br> </br> The ruling class of Soheque are the most skilled of mages, with few exceptions. Their authority is precarious, its authority questioned by some, due to their current greatest asset, their firm ties with an important faith. The largest issue currently facing Soheque is the current heir is seen by most of the government as unacceptable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Millitary">Millitary</h4>
<p>The City-state of Soheque's millitary is below average for Eyom, with a few disadvantages and not very many banes. It favors an antiquated millitary compossion with its troops being almost entirly infantry. It makes up for these shortfalls with mandatory conscription of sourcerors, and other mages. Soheque's millitary is known for its embrasure of traditional combat methods, and being slow to adopt any new aracana or tech. </br>  </br> The millitary favors a doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combined operations">combined operations</a> in its millitary operations, but is willing and able to use others should the need arise. Soheque's armed forces are mostly of volenteers with some conscripts in times of war, which generaly view themselves as a caste of warriors above from civilians who are more of an orniment for their nation to wear than a sword or shield, by remaining ever ready for war.  </br>  </br> Soheque's millitary has roughly the following composision:<\p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total Troops:</b> 210058 (7% population)</li>
<li><b>Volenteer Forces:</b> 147040 (70% millitary)</li>
<li><b>Conscript Forces:</b> 63017 (30% millitary)</li>

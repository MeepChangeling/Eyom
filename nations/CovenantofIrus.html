<p>The Covenant of Irus's millitary is ahead of the curve for Eyom, with few problems and a few serious advantages. It favors a mixture of armored calvory and special forces, leaving its infantry as a rear guard. The Covenant uses airships in the conventional fashion, as troop transport and commandposts, but has been known to attempt to develop air-based artillery platforms from time to time. The Covenant's millitary is known for its embrasure of traditional combat methods, and being slow to adopt any new aracana or tech. </br>  </br> The millitary favors a doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep operation">deep operation</a> in its millitary operations, but is willing and able to use others should the need arise. The Covenant's armed forces are mostly composed of members of a dedicated warrior caste, with volenteers padding out the ranks, which generaly view themselves as a caste of warriors above from civilians who serve the intrests of the nobility, by applying violence as needed.  </br>  </br> The Covenant's millitary has roughly the following composision:<\p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="GovernmentAndPolitics">Government and Politics</h4>
<p>The Viceroyalty of Rosid is ruled by a Council of Elders, which is in turn governed by the Grand Elder who serves as the nation's Sovereign, though their powers are amongst the most limited of all Sovereigns in Eyom, both due to the design of their government, and status as a Client State of the Covenant of Irus. </br> </br> In Rosid, the sovereign is a member of a particular clan who has held onto power longer than most can remeber, and supported by a group affectionately and fearfully called "the brute squad". ^</br^> ^</br^> The ruling class of Rosid are individuals with substantial military power, with few exceptions. Their authority is stable enough endure even fierce shocks, due to their current greatest asset, an expert spymaster serves it well.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Millitary">Millitary</h4>
<p>The Viceroyalty of Rosid's millitary is average for Eyom with a few boons and banes. It favors a mixture of armored calvory and special forces, leaving its infantry as a rear guard. Rosid uses airships in the conventional fashion, as troop transport and commandposts, but has been known to attempt to develop air-based artillery platforms from time to time. Rosid's armed forces eschew technological options wherever possible. </br>  </br> The millitary favors a doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/force concentration">force concentration</a> in its millitary operations, but is willing and able to use others should the need arise. Rosid's armed forces are almost all of its youths, who are required to serve as solgiers for a short piriod, with many remaining with the service as a form of career, which generaly view themselves as protectors of the region who keep the peace, by enforcing the will of the people.  </br>  </br> Rosid's millitary has roughly the following composision:<\p>

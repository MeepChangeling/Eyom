<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="GovernmentAndPolitics">Government and Politics</h4>
<p>The United Kingdom of Undermountain is ruled by a High King or Queen who serves as the nation's Sovereign. Their word is law, and their power is absolute, but is traditionally exercised within the strict bounds of a particular code known as the Charter. In effect, their duty is to ensure all Dwarves preform their divine tasks according to the Charter, and normally act through their subordinates, allowing them freedom to heed their orders within the guidelines of the Charter. </br> </br> In Undermountain, the sovereign is the most prominent citizen within Orcäbn Nabÿh Cewkez (regardless of their former station), and supported by various bureaucratic organizations run by the common people. </br> </br> The ruling class of Undermountain are members of a hereditary nobility, and old-wealth families who while not necessarily titled, have vast treasuries, with few exceptions. Their authority is stable enough endure even fierce shocks, due to their current greatest asset, their firm ties with an important faith. The largest issue currently facing Undermountain is foreign powers are stirring up and backing a group of malcontents.</p>

It favors a mixture of armored calvery and infantry, while using airships for close support and command centers. Undermountain's millitary makes use of advanced arcana above all else. </br>  </br> The millitary favors a doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asymmetric warfare">asymmetric warfare</a> in its millitary operations, but is willing and able to use others should the need arise. Undermountain's armed forces are a mixture of volenteer specilists and constructs, which generaly view themselves as a caste of warriors appart from civilians who defend the state more than the people, by enforcing the will of the people.  </br>  </br> Undermountain's millitary has roughly the following composision:<\p>
<ul>

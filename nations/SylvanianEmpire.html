<p>The Sylvanian Empire (also known as Sylvania) is a the third empire to bear its name, and is located in central Eyom. Its predominantly <a href="..\cultures\sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> citizens live within its 1,439,905 km<sup>2</sup>, and primarily speak <a href="..\languages\Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a>.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="GovernmentAndPolitics">Government and Politics</h4>
<p>The Sylvanian Empire is ruled by an Emperor (Who may choose the title Empress if desired, but tradition has most sovereigns refusing to gender their title). The Emperor's powers are limited by a simple constitution, though many provisions exist for the use of unlimited powers in certain situations. More limiting than the constitution is the ancient legal body known as the Law of Sylvia, which while not completely binding, would almost certainly result in a noble and populist revolt if violated. </br> </br> In Sylvania, the sovereign is the most powerful (or wealthy) merchant within Sylvania's bounds, and supported by the church. </br> </br> The ruling class of Sylvania are a particular ethnic minority which has long served as the bulk of Sylvania's government, with few exceptions. Their authority is precarious, its authority questioned by some, due to their current greatest asset, their firm economic control over the land. The largest issue currently facing Sylvania is foreign powers are stirring up and backing a group of malcontents.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Millitary">Millitary</h4>
<p>The Sylvanian Empire's millitary is average for Eyom with a few boons and banes. It favors a mixture of armored calvery and infantry, while using airships for close support and command centers. Sylvania's armed forces heavily favor advanced technology. </br>  </br> The millitary favors a doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conventional warfare">conventional warfare</a> in its millitary operations, but is willing and able to use others should the need arise. Sylvania's armed forces are a mixture of volenteer specilists and constructs, which generaly view themselves as protectors of the region who defend the state more than the people, by applying violence as needed.  </br>  </br> Sylvania's millitary has roughly the following composision:<\p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total Troops:</b> 1682884 (4% population)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Infantry Troops:</b> 774126 (774126% forces)</li>

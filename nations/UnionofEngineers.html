<p>The Union of Engineers (also known as The Engineer's Guild) is a a member of the League of Gnollish Cities, a loose alliance of nations in north western Eyom which loosly function as part of a greater whole. Its predominantly <a href="..\cultures\ironelf.html">Iron Elvish</a> citizens live within its 3,077,313 km<sup>2</sup>, and primarily speak <a href="..\languages\Menèian.html">Menèian</a>.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="GovernmentAndPolitics">Government and Politics</h4>
<p>The Union of Engineers is run by the Guildmaster who serves as the nation's Sovereign, and holds powers which make them roughly equivalent to the President of a Republic. </br> </br> The ruling class of The Engineer's Guild are members of a psudo-hereditary line of master crafstmen within the guild, and old-wealth families who while not necessarily parts of the guild, are respected as investors and thus afforded a vote in Guild affairs. Their authority is precarious, oipenly questioned by some due to the dissapearance of their former greatest asset, an expert spymaster who serves it a little too well. The largest issue currently facing The Engineer's Guild is the sovereign's attempts to crush an insubordinate who has obtained too much power.</p> 
<h3 class="articlesubtitle" id="Soverign">Soverign</h3>
<p>The current soverign of the Union of Engineers is [ruler name]. Their power over The Engineer's Guild is so absolute they may as well be the entirety of the government.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Millitary">Millitary</h4>
<p>The Union of Engineers's millitary is ahead of the curve for Eyom, with few problems and a few serious advantages. It favors a mixture of armored calvory and special forces, leaving its infantry as a rear guard. The Engineer's Guild uses airships in the conventional fashion, as troop transport and commandposts, but has been known to attempt to develop air-based artillery platforms from time to time. The Engineer's Guild's armed forces eschew technological options wherever possible. </br>  </br> The millitary favors a doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combined operations">combined operations</a> in its millitary operations, but is willing and able to use others should the need arise. The Engineer's Guild's armed forces are a mixture of volenteer specilists and constructs, which generaly view themselves as protectors of the people who serve as The Engineer's Guild's shield, by being an immovable wall.  </br>  </br> The Engineer's Guild's millitary has roughly the following composision:<\p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total Troops:</b> 11257494 (12% population)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Infantry Troops:</b> 5516172 (5516172% forces)</li>
<li><b>Armored Calvery:</b> 1238324 (11% forces)</li>
<li><b>Artillery Units:</b> 3489823 (31% forces)</li>
<li><b>Air Force Personel:</b> 2169544 (4216% forces)</li>
<li><b>Special Forces Units:</b> 10173479 (-4728096% forces)</li>
</ul>

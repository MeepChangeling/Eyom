<p>The Confederation of Goblin Tribes (also known as Lin) is a a confederacy of many Goblin tribes located within Lin Forest in western Eyom. Its predominantly <a href="..\cultures\goblin.html">Goblin</a> citizens live within its 782,181 km<sup>2</sup>, and primarily speak <a href="..\languages\Goblin.html">Goblin</a>.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="GovernmentAndPolitics">Government and Politics</h4>
<p>The Confederation of Goblin Tribes is ruled by a Queen who is technically the sovereign of the Confederation, though her powers are limited to coordinating the many tribes efforts for mutual projects, public works, and defense. In Lin, the sovereign is the most prominent citizen within Mō̂ōg Bây Éer (regardless of their former station), and supported by various bureaucratic organizations run by the common people. </br> </br> The ruling class of Lin are members of a hereditary nobility, and old-wealth families who while not necessarily titled, have vast treasuries, with few exceptions. Their authority is has significant problems, but it functions, due to their current greatest asset, their diplomats' awe inspiring cunning. The largest issue currently facing Lin is foreign powers are stirring up and backing a group of malcontents.</p> 
<h3 class="articlesubtitle" id="Soverign">Soverign</h3>
<p>The current soverign of the Confederation of Goblin Tribes is [ruler name]. They presently rely on a large support network for their power, with few officials supporting them, but rather their supporters.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Millitary">Millitary</h4>
<p>The Confederation of Goblin Tribes's millitary is ahead of the curve for Eyom, with few problems and a few serious advantages. It favors a mixture of armored calvory and special forces, leaving its infantry as a rear guard. Lin uses airships in the conventional fashion, as troop transport and commandposts, but has been known to attempt to develop air-based artillery platforms from time to time. Lin's millitary is known for its embrasure of traditional combat methods, and being slow to adopt any new aracana or tech. </br>  </br> The millitary favors a doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defence diplomacy">defence diplomacy</a> in its millitary operations, but is willing and able to use others should the need arise. Lin's armed forces are mostly of volenteers with some conscripts in times of war, which generaly view themselves as protectors of the common good who are the sword of Lin, by enforcing the will of the people.  </br>  </br> Lin's millitary has roughly the following composision:<\p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total Troops:</b> 2285121 (7% population)</li>
<li><b>Volenteer Forces:</b> 1485328 (65% millitary)</li>
<li><b>Conscript Forces:</b> 799792 (35% millitary)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Infantry Troops:</b> 959750 (959750% forces)</li>
<li><b>Armored Calvery:</b> 205660 (9% forces)</li>
<li><b>Artillery Units:</b> 685536 (30% forces)</li>
<li><b>Air Force Personel:</b> 20348178 (2770% forces)</li>
<li><b>Special Forces Units:</b> -5436593 (-891138% forces)</li>
</ul>

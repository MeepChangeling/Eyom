<p>Sylvin is one of Eyom's major cultures. It's reach covers 2,176,912 square kilometers in western Eyom, and is comprised of approximately 25,292,814 individuals in urban centers.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 26%;">
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Scociety">Society</h4>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 3%;">
<div style="margin-left: 24%;">	
<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="ArtHistory">Art</h5>
</div>
<p>The majority of Sylvin's art is commissioned by the wealthy, with a full 60% commissioned by the aristocracy. Artistic endeavors are partly funded by the state through many trusts, with yearly budgets set for artistic expression. Sylvin culture treats artists with great respect, with both high and low born citizens often idolizing a articular artist. This is due to Sylvin culture using the majority of its art as a general facet of everyday life and a primary promoter of cultural unity. Sylvin culture also uses its art for: celebrating life, easing the learning process through visual aids, swaying public opinion towards specific goals, ridiculing cultural norms, and immortalizing key figures of history and mythology.</p>
</p>Sylvian culture considers art to be taboo if it conveys erotic feelings, provokes or incites violence, or conflicts with generally held religious beliefs. Works which are either illegal or taboo are enshrined by those it resonates with and desecrated by those it provokes.</p>
<p>As Sylvin culture is almost entirely contained within the bounds of its Empire, some of the Sylvin Empire's laws are relevant to the discussion of Sylvin art. Sylvian culture has two notable laws relating to the creation of art:</p>
<div class="quotebox">
<ol>
<li>All art that is intended for public display must be individually authorized by all relevant authorities at all levels of government and ownership of property.</li>
<li>No work of art may not directly criticize the government. All critical works must criticize the person or persons responsible for the subject of the criticism or must directly criticize the specific policy or policies subject within the art without any mention of their authors.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The first of these two laws is intended to ensure that once a piece of art is installed, it is nearly impossible to remove as it already has the approval of all layers of government and any relevant property owners on which the art has been installed. The removal of art is seen as a crime, unless the art was intended to be temporary or is too highly damaged to repair. Art that cannot be repaired is often replaced with an imitation or a recreation if the original artist is still alive.</p>
<p>The second of these two laws was recently enacted to combat a general cultural distrust and hatred of the institution of government itself. The goal was accomplished by realigning the public's opinions toward individuals within the government. This transformed Sylvin culture from one which despised the government in general to one which is far more politically educated and can typically name all currently serving members of their local and regional governments and name said politicians general goals and current political dealings. The general view of the government is now that of a machine that requires many engineers to run, some of whom are corrupt; this is opposed to the previous view of "an unwanted cesspool".</p>
<p>Presently, Sylvin culture greatly favors the preforming arts. They primarily focus on dance, with their greatest works consisting of dancing making use of rapid foot movements to replace or supplement the percussion within the music being preformed for the purpose of the dance, often making use of specialized footwear to enhance the sound produced by the dancer's feet. The foremost artisan within this medium is the dancer Keif Vindleberg, whose works are typically the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Sylvin's artwork of the current era.</p>
<p>In the Visual Arts, they primarily focused on painting, with their greatest works consisting of finger painting using oil on silk. Their art shows a particular emphasis on hues, texture, and value. The foremost artisan within this medium is the painter Masha Vale, whose works are typically the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Sylvin's artwork of the current era.</p>
<p>In the Literary Arts, Silvin culture is primarily focused on literary fiction, with their greatest works consisting of a form of narrative where fantastical tales of marvelous adventures are presented in order to convey various ideas about virtue, nobility, and honor to the reader. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the author Hoskins McGlothlin, whose works are typically the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Sylvin's artwork of the current era.</p>
<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="PopCulture">Pop Culture</h5>
<p>Sylvin's popular culture is dominated by theater and literature. These arts are made available to the public through collections and a small number of large institutions and corporations who have monetized theater as a business, profiting off ticket sales while outsourcing the cost of creating the plays to the general public. This exchange is seens fair by most due to the playwrights not choosing which plays they produce, but rather allowing all who help fund a play to vote on which story will be performed that year. Naturally, donating more buys one more votes.</p>
<p>In recent times, the impact of theater on Sylvin culture has diminished. This is primarily due to the creation of seeming, glamour, and illusions of plays having become an artform of their own. The majority of playwrights will use illusory duplications of the greatest actors of past generations to fill rolls they would have been suited for if they were available (or, in many cases, still alive). The public generally dislikes this practice, seeing it as depriving the world of new generations of artists. Consequently, theater has fallen out of favor in terms of large-scale expensive productions for the masses. This movement has been countered by the emergence of small-scale local volunteer acting troops in what many call a regression to previously over trodden grounds.</p>
<p>This complaint is rooted in an ancient Sylvin tradition seen at fairs and other celebrations where volunteers who have trained for years of their lives would fill specific rolls within plays depicting events important to the event, or the local area. These eventually translated into a medium for telling any story anyone wished to tell and could convince the troop to preform. This, in turn led to the modern era of massive productions, which the general public is rebelling against.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="HighCulture">High Culture</h5>
<p>Sylvin's high culture is dominated by theater and painting. These arts are made available to members of the cultural elite through capitalist ventures.</p>
<p>Unlike the theater of pop culture, high culture's theater remained small, with most nobles and aristocrats owning their own private theater troops. These troops are used for performances made to entertain guests and one's self alike, with the majority of their work never being seen outside of one-off performances with a few exceptions for works which were shared amongst groups of nobles and due to the money and power behind them have become cultural mainstays.</p>
<p>Due to its nature as the personal commission of a single individual, or a small group of individuals, high culture's works tend to have a very niche and focused nature. Each work is different and tailored to the patron's personal tastes. Thus, no trends can be gleaned from these works other than a general desire within the nobility for plays that have nothing to do with current events.</p>
<p>For many years, private troops were seen as thieves who withheld their talents from the public, but in recent times due to the various controversies in popular theater, the opinion has reversed. Generally speaking, these troops are seen as people who respected the craft too much to "Fall in" with the general public's commercialized theater.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="CommunicationAndTheSpreadOfIdeas">Communication And The Spread Of Ideas</h5>
<p>Sylvin culture allows new ideas to spread organically but prefers to keep such things personal and intimate. Hearts and minds is the idea, though "Don't talk about it" is the result more often than not. While Sylvin culture has embraced printing (especially newspapers) and is one of the primary adopters of the aethary, it prefers to use these mediums for discussing ideas already present within its public discourse.</p>
<p>There is no single force keeping this status quo. Instead, it appears to be an emergent property of other elements of Sylvin culture, which Syvins themselves value. Family ties, the urge to get ahead, to have a leg up on one's enemies, and a desire to be known as the master of something with cultural weight all come together to create a culture that's slow to embrace new ideas. It's also slow to drop bad ideas, with many factions debating outdated problems for clout rather than focusing on new or emerging problems. Or opportunities.</p>
<p>This process is compounded by Sylvin culture's status as an amalgam of thousands of smaller cultures that were forged from the shards of the First Sylvin Empire's fall and shaped by the biology of the biologically Sylvin people. Given the nature of the curses affecting Biological Sylvins, it is largely impossible for Sylvins to rely on body language, even within their own clans and families.</p>
<p>When four of a family have an emotionally expressive tail, and one does not, the tailless one is left behind. Some Sylvin can smell pheromones and use them to judge emotions, others cannot. Some can hear heartbeats up close and know if someone is fearful, angry, or lying. Others do not.</p>
<p>Sylvins rely on words more than anything for proper communication, even though the majority of their members subconsciously attempt to understand body language at all times. The misunderstandings caused through this process have resulted in the creation of formal schools to teach communication skills. Unfortunately, these can only help so much. No one can deny nature to the same extent as everyone else. Some learn to communicate through the barriers, others learn to peek through with they pay close attention, and others simply cannot learn these skills.</p>
<p>This barrier is the easiest to surpass. Sylvins are inflicted with two curses, and the bite of the second cuts far deeper. With most species with sexual dimorphism, certain patterns of behavior, general preferences, and trends exist between the sexes. These can be understood and easily used to understand others of the same sex more often than not.</p>
<p>Sylvins do not have this luxury. They have two sexes, but these are only reproductive. There is no way to tell males and females apart at a glance and even if one has been briefed on the reproductive organs of a biological Sylvin individual, that infomration would be of no help in understanding their mind. Thus Sylvin do not know upon meeting someone for the first time what that person might value, respect, or want. There cannot be a frame of reference for this meeting based on species nor sex. The whole of Sylvin culture rests uppon people who must communicate their identities in words to people who want words to be secondary to how those words are said.</p>
<p>These factors have created a culture that is incredibly individualistic and often rejects blood relations entirely. It is not unusual for young Sylvins to leave home at the end of their adolescence in search of a place they belong. Where there are others like them. Thus, Sylvin communication with itself is notably poor.</p>
<p>There are things that unite and bind them as one people. Common goals. Common enemies. Shared histories. They must be reminded of these things regularly to remain unified. Otherwise, they fragment, seeking out their peerage. Especially when that peerage does not exist.</p>
<p>All of this is critical to Sylvin culture. New ideas spread slowly and often die. This is their filter. New ideas which can survive within their society have something to them. Some values that can transcend these critical limits. Thus, when a new idea survives the gauntlet and becomes something most people have heard of, it is often adopted culture-wide within mere months.</p>
<p>Social institutions and governments within Sylvin culture do their best to ensure there are such reminders in daily life. Symbols are greatly important. Art is a necessity. Speeches. Festivals. The Sylvins can exist as an Empire, but without their Empire, they would break apart into many new nations. It is seen as the duty of the government to ensure such a fate never happens. Sylvins are after all, humans. They understand what would happen to their peaceful lives if unity died.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="Holidays">Holidays</h5>
<p>Holidays are especially important cultural unifies within Sylvin culture. There are five major holidays universally celebrated through all areas in which the culture has any notable influence. These five holidays are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Magus's Eves</strong> <em>(aka Magi's Night)</em><br />
<ol style="list-style: none;">
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>A festival festival held the night before each solstice, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. While strictly speaking this is four holidays, the event itself is split into quarters with parts of a singular ritual performed on each day. There is no unified idea of what the ritual is, exactly. In one place it may be a blood sacrifice of an animal, in another it could be melting down coinage into a singular block and burying it. In others, it involves channeling specific spell energies into various vessels.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>While the regional purpose of these rituals has been lost to time, they are said to bring fortune to those who participate. Some of the rituals have genuine arcane functions, though their effects are corrupt and low energy, preventing extrapolation. Archaeological evidence suggests the earliest form of the ritual involved the offering of a newly grown young adult's virginity, and that this was done away with over 1400 years ago.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>The modern holiday is still centered around these many rituals, but other celebratory events have arisen over the years, leading to many activities split into quarters with one quarter performed on one of the days. Chief among these is the Legend of Silva, the recounting of the life of the Sylvin Empire's founder, which is split into four chapters: Childhood (spring), Rise (summer), Reign (autumn), Fall (winter). This is now the main purpose of the holiday, a reflection on shared history through mythology.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>People's Day</strong>
<ol style="list-style: none;">
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>People's Day is a celebration of local and regional culture, history, and accomplishments held on the 11th of Dèkè Qu. The vast majority of people begin celebrating on the 9th, and reserve the 11 for the traditional events such as reenactments, plays, and speeches.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>The other two days are used for annual fairs. These fairs are the source of a very culturally important gift, historic replicas. An ancient courtship tradition states that true love is proven by gifting a prospective spouse a replica historic artifact which not only does the giver believe represents their love in a particular way, but that the reliever understands as representing them in the same way without communication. As the gift is meant to be given on People's Day, an industry arose around last minute gift giving as the seriousness of the tradition waned over time.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Firetongue</strong>
<ol style="list-style: none;">
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Firetongue is 10 day long festival beginning on the 26th of Qëtê Nadizi and running into the next year, ending on the 5th of Qëthê Qu. Its purpose is to codify the stories of those who died during the year, and to recite the stories of those so great their names have yet to be forgotten.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>This is accomplished through the use of many storytellers who will light fires that are kept burning for the ten days. These stories are spoken as if a great crowd has come to hear them told, even if none are there to listen. Typically, the celebration of this holiday is very somber, serving as a second funeral.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>After the first five days have passed, the festival turns from remembrance to celebration. Local heros legends are told, and crowds tend ot gather for them in the evenings, sharing the tale with a mug of ale. In recent times, potlucks have become popular at these recitations.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>Grainday</strong>
<ol style="list-style: none;">
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Grainday is a harvest holiday designed to celebrate the life of a specific Wizard, though it has grown into a general purpose festival for celebrating the technological and scientific discoveries and breakthroughs of Eyom in general.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>In its orgional form, the holiday celebrated <em><span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">Aquilo</span></span> Borlaug</em>, a 17th Century Wizard who discovered an arcane means of reproducing certain druidic magics. These spells created effects functionally identicle to <em><a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/purify-food-and-drink">Purify Food and Drink</a></em>, <em><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hidden-spring">Hidden Spring</a></em>, and <em><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-growth">Plant Growth</a></em>. Unfortunately, these spells were greatly elevated in energy level in the conversion from druidic to arcane such that no one aside from the most elite mages could cast them.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Magi Borlaug spent the remainder of his days searching for a means of making any of the spells practical for the average farmer to use. He eventualy discovered an entirely mundane means of creating semi-dwarf, high-<a title="Crop yield" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield">yield</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Phytopathology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytopathology">disease</a>-resistant species of maize, rice, wheat, and potatoes. These crops were so potent that 4-5 times more food could be grown on the same area of land, with only twice as much water and nutrients. He published his research in a scientific journal, as well as farmer's almanacs, becoming the first Wizard to become a scientist (In recorded history at any rate), and saw the small scale adoption of his engineered crops before his death.<br /><br />Shortly after his death, an especially harsh winter and dry spring hit many Sylvin regions, devastating crops and rendering a growing season so late that any attempt at a harvest before first snow that year impossible. This came on the heals of a major plague, which had depleted both manpower and granary reserves. If not for the great yields produced by the few farms which had adopted Borlaug's crops, an estimated 60% of Sylvins would have starved to death.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Magi Borlaug was hailed as a hero, and posthumously given a Doctorate of Agricultural Science by the University of Kingsmead many great honors and awards, chief among which was the holiday in his honor, taking place on the 12th of Sêqëê Nadizi (both a great date for harvesting many crops, and his birthday). The holiday began to celebrate other great inventors and scientists within a century, with the prerequisite of their invention having either saved, or improved, the lives of uncountable people.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Many people have forgotten <span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">Aquilo</span></span> Borlaug was a wizard, leading to the loss of some of his contributions to arcane knowledge. However, most people alive today use his spell to locate lost keys, though they do not know it to be his work as well.<br />
<ol style="list-style: none;">
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Eventide</strong><br />
<ol style="list-style: none;">
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eventide is a summer solstice celebration taking place on the day of the summer solstice. It is an important cultural holiday which symbolizes balance between forces and factions. As the night and day have become equal lengths, so do does all of Sylvanian culture. One's station in life is ignored for the day, nobles mix with serfs and outlaws are welcomed to town for the celebration.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is a time of forgiveness and unity. Many debts are forgiven, promises are made to improve certain things, and serious conversations are had without the fear of being punished for impudence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="GenderAndGenderRoles">Gender and Gender Roles</h5>
<p>Sylvin culture has no gender roles. It's simply impossible for it to have any standards for behavior, occupations, or even preferences based on someone's sex. This is due to biological Sylvins being afflicted by the <a href="../misc/GenusIniuriam.html">Genus Iniuriam</a> curse. This curse decouples the subject's physical forms from their sex, such that while some Sylvins appear male, are male, and act male and others appear female, are female, and act female, they comprise a mere 34% of all Sylvins.</p>
<p>Sylvin are largely randomized. Someone who appears to be a large and burly male could be biologically female while lacking any female secondary sex characteristics. Likewise, a small and fair maiden could be male while possessing all female secondary sex characteristics while having a masculine personality. Every possibility is equally represented within them.</p>
<p>Consequently, Sylvins cannot prejudge people based on their sex, and have no good clues as to the genders of those they interact with. Each person must be treated as an individual. The natural instincts of the human mind greatly abhor such granularity. They cry out for simplicity and boxes in which to put things. Thus, Sylvin culture substitutes gender roles for Physical Rolls.</p>
<p>Sylvin culture takes the predominant trait of someone's mind and body and uses it as the substitute for their gender. For example, a muscular person is believed to be strong and enjoy things that require great strength and will be looked down on if they prefer to spend their life on things that do not require their strength.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, this has mixed with the Sylvin culture's need for individuality by creating a standardized system of measuring one's physical attributes, which is used both as a means of predicting what people are like, and also as a sort of horoscope, as well as a game for those who enjoy competing with friends for higher scores. This system is called the System for Tabulating Athletics and Technical Strength, or STATS for short (Yes, Doctor Jessica Fieldsman is very proud of that acronym).</p>
<p>Given its importance, STATS will be explored in brief in the following section.</p>

<div style="margin-left:3%;">
<h6 class="articlesubtitle" id="STATS">System for Tabulating Athletic and Technical Strength</h6>
<p>STATS uses six metrics to represent a person's most basic attributes. These metrics are measurements of their raw talent and prowess. Each metric is assigned a score, generally from 3 to 18. For Sylvins, an average metric's rating, or ability score, is 10. The average for other species is different for each species, though the number range uses Sylvins as the "standard of measurement. This is important to note as STATS is a multi-species system, and can be applied to almost any lifeform.</p>
<p>The six metrics are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Dexterity</li>
<li>Constitution</li>
<li>Intelligence</li>
<li>Wisdom</li>
<li>Charisma</li>
</ol>
<p>Strength is a measurement of simple physical might. It uses how much mass a person can lift and carry without being hampered as its primary metric, though many other factors go into calculating this metric. A 10 in Strength requires the ability to lift and carry up to 33 pounds for 8 hours without consequences. This score changes by +/- 1 point per 3.5 pounds, assuming all other factors are also average.</p>
<p>Dexterity is a measurement of physical speed, reaction times, and hand-eye coordination. It's a very complex metric that defies easy explanation. Suffice to say that a 10 in dexterity permits an individual to perform such feats as catching thrown hand-sized objects without difficulty and being able to run a mile in 9 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Constitution is a measurement of one's physical hardiness. It is calculated based on how much physical trauma one can endure before succumbing to helplessness. This includes injury, illness, poisons, and all other physically debilitating events and substances. A score of 10 implies general good health, with few instances of illness per year and the ability to continue working in spite of minor injuries.</p>
<p>Intelligence is a measurement of one's ability to learn and reason using available information. The calculation of this metric is particularly difficult, requiring several lengthy tests of many different areas and fields, preferably performed multiple times across several days to get an average of ability regardless of external factors such as mood. A 10 in this metric means the individual is able to retain and utilize all necessary information to care for themselves, manage their own affairs, and perform all tasks required for their day-to-day life.</p>
<p>The Wisdom metric is a measurement of willpower, common sense, awareness, and intuition. This stat is the most likely to increase as an individual ages. A 10 in this metric means the individual is capable of detailed and realistic planning of goals and makes reasoned decisions most of the time as judged by a panel of their peers. Due to this, few people have an accurately measured Wisdom Score, as it's impractical for 10-12 people of similar stations, education, and regions to be called in to test every member of a population every few years. Typically only politicians and nobles have accurate Wisdom scores, with everyone else's being an estimate based on the thoughts of their physician or doctor.</p>
<p>Officially, Chrisma is a measurement of one's understanding of social graces and their ability to persuade others. Unofficially, it's also used to gauge general attractiveness. Ongoing campaigns to remove the "beauty bias" from this metric are met with backlash insisting that as more attractive people have an easier time being heard and persuading others, it should be an official part of the metric. A 10 in this category means an individual is able to understand most conventions of social interactions and acts relatively acceptably in social circumstances. They are able to persuade some people to listen to them some of the time, provided they have a reasonable argument. The unofficial metric lists appearance for a 10 as being not particularly attractive or unattractive.</p>
<p>This system was originally intended for general medical use, but was co-opted for a general-use assessment of individuals. Employers will use STATS to reject or accept individuals, and many government programs require a STATS score below 10 before certain kinds of welfare will be made available.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="SubculturesAndAlternativeLifestyles">Subcultures and Alternative Lifestyles</h5>
<p>Sylvin culture is something of an umbrella culture, with dozens of notable subgroups found within its folds. These groups used to be more distinct, but have largely melded into a singular amalgamation of their general beliefs and practices over the last 200 years. The interesting aspect of the change is each sub-culture insists it is precisely as it was before, and everyone else is attempting to imitate them.</p>
<p>The exception to this is the Twelve Great Tribes. Each of the original human tribes remaining in Eyom has its own culture and practices, which are sharply defined to this day. A simple summarization of the Twelve Tribes follows:</p>
<ol class="articlelist2" style="padding-left: 7%;">
<li><strong>Apis -</strong> Hard working, communal, industrious laborers. Focused on development, improvement, and furthering all material goals.</li>
<li><strong>Bombyx -</strong> A relaxed and rural culture based around trade.</li>
<li><strong>Canis - </strong>A marshal culture based on honor, loyalty, and duty.</li>
<li><strong>Capra -</strong> Carries a very strong arcane tradition, with little care for science and the plight of non-mages.</li>
<li><strong>Equus -</strong> A very communal culture based on agriculture.</li>
<li><strong>Felis -</strong> A nomadic culture known for its wagon trains and ancient migratory paths. Often serve as merchants and messengers. Known to keep roads in good repair.</li>
<li><strong>Gallus -</strong> An industrial culture with a notable emphasis on brewing (beverages and potions).</li>
<li><strong>Ovis -</strong> An entire culture of <a href="https://youtu.be/iKQSv8p9BXU?t=408">elite warriors</a> who are really angry history keeps insisting they don't get to just be farmers.</li>
<li><strong>Scrofa -</strong> A rather decadent culture based around the acquisition of personal wealth and power.</li>
<li><strong>Tarandus -</strong> A mostly isolated culture with many ancient nature-worship-based practices. Often accused of practicing druidic rituals.</li>
<li><strong>Taurus -</strong> A bunch of slightly polite and kind rural folk with an understandably large variety of and passion for dairy products.</li>
<li><strong>Varanus -</strong> A seemingly lazy culture known for producing many great thinkers.</li>
</ol>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="UniversalFears">Universal Fears</h5>
<p>The top five most common fears found within Sylvin's members are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Devastating tornados</li></p>
<li>Arcane Weapons attack</li></p>
<li>Government restrictions on firearms and ammunition</li></p>
<li>Changes to the Welfare System</li></p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="MoneyAndWealth">Money and Wealth</h4>
<p>In Sylvin culture, wealth and money have a special place as a treasured resource. This has created a general air where the poor dislike the wealthy (seeing them as wasteful and extravagant) while the wealthy find the conditions the poor live in to be revolting (Usually by the way of pity, but often with disgust). Opportunities for social mobility exist for the well educated and hardworking, as there are typically no other barriers to becoming wealthy or influential. The soul complication is that over the years, the elites of Sylvin communities have come to own the majority of their community's wealth. Hence, anyone seeking to enter their ranks must find some means of extracting wealth from them.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, primary education is available to all, while secondary and specialist trades are taught to anyone who can afford to not work long enough to learn them (or are able to function on little sleep in order to work for a living while taking classes). Sylvin culture has unofficially restricted career options by class due to this, but many modern political movements are seeking to increase the equality of opportunists available to everyone.</p>
<p>Within Sylvin culture, homes and family-related infrastructure available to the vast majority of people, healthcare is available to most at reasonable prices, and anyone with wealth can gain social or political power. The majority of people believe the system they are a part of is harsh but fair, and most individuals agree on what changes could be made to improve thir lot in life.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Food">Food, Meals, and Mealtime</h4>
<p>Sylvin's members typically eat three meals, one at noon, one in the late afternoon, and one at night, which are generally eaten in solitude. The solitude is seemingly due to embarrassment coming form the spectrum of beastblood mutations and their resulting changes to how an individual may prefer or need to consume their food. Sylvins with rodent teeth need to gnaw to wear down their teeth for health reasons, and are easily embarised if their chewing annoys others with its volume. Many canid Sylvins prefer to lap their beverages from a bowl. Sylvins with beaks often need to peck and crush harder food to pulp in a bowl before swallowing it. The Sciuridae Tribe is notorious for eating two meals at once, storing the second in cheek pouches for later, a process many others find disgusting.</p>
<p>For many, the chaos of a group of Sylvins eating is repulsive due to the general inability to create universl table manners. Thus, most Sylvins choose to gather for a meal with personal cutlery, plates, and bowls, tank the cook for the meal, and then find a quite spot to eat on their own before returning to public areas and communal activities.</p>
<p>Flat bread is the fundamental base of all meals to be had in Sylvin culture. Other staples include rice, roti made from atta flour, and beans. Foods are flavoured with various types of chilli, black pepper, cloves, and other strong herbs and spices along with the flavoured butter ghee. Ginger is an ingredient that can be used in both savory and sweet recipes. Chopped ginger is fried with meat and pickled ginger is often an accompaniment to boiled rice. Ginger juice and ginger boiled in syrup are used to make desserts. Turmeric and cumin are often used to make curries. Common meats include lamb, goat, fish, chicken and beef. Beef is less common. Pork is considered as a taboo food item by all Sylvins, though it is commonly eaten in some remote regions. A variety of very sweet desserts which use dairy products is also found in Sylvin cuisine. The main ingredients in desserts is condensed milk, ground almonds, lentil flour, ghee and sugar.</p>
<p>Sylvin culture has several prominent spring festivals, which are culinary significant due to potlucks being one of the main draws to attend the festivals</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Leisure">Leisure</h4>
<p>Sylvin's members typically prefer to work long hours but also demand periods of rest, relaxation, and leisure, which is a pleasure regularly enjoyed by elites with a few days a week officially designated as leisure days. The poorer classes are generally unable to stop working during these days, though everyone finds at least five days a month which can be labor-free and thus used for all manner of recreation.</p>
<p>Popular adult pastimes include:</p>

</ol></p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="Charity">Charity and Welfare</h5>
<p>In Sylvin culture acts of charity are generally preformed on rare occasions, for reasons specific to the donor (often political protests against existing welfare policies, or to publicly show one's stance for or against something seemingly unrelated to the charity in question). Donors are typically seen as somewhat foolish by the rest of their culture, due to the robustness of Sylvin welfare systems. Donations are typically made to assist the abused, with notably less going to other groups in need.</p>
<p>As with all of Eyom's cultures, general welfare is of excellent quality and reach. By Eyom's standards, Sylvin welfare is above and beyond that of most other nations. Food and shelter programs are ubiquitous, with food seen as a human right and therefore all basic food stuffs will be provided to all. Full stop. The state will pay the farmers for their labor. Programs to assist the poor with acquiring basic necessities such as clothing, tools for their profession, etc are omnipresent and designed to ensure there will never need to be a repeat customer barring nothing short of the worst luck one could imagine. These institutions are backed by ancient trusts, corporations, and laws dating back to the first Sylvin Empire and are one of the many ways the will of Silva himself is still felt in the modern world.</p>
<p>Sylvin culture has a notorious punishment for many serious crimes which involves declaring someone an Outlaw. This removes them from all protections of the law, as well as prevents them from accessing any of the culture's wealth by denying them welfare. These individuals are branded on the forehead such that it is extremely difficult to conceal their outlaw status. Many other cultures see this practice as barbaric and part of why Sylvin nations have a notably worse time with banditry.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="HealthFitnessAndBeautyStandards">Health, Fitness, and Beauty Standards</h5>
<p>Sylvin culture has sciencified its health and fitness standards with STATS. Of course, there is some controversy with the system. Notably in their lack of any real beauty standards. Given the average sylvin varies in appearance from "Entirely human provided they are dressed." to "Is that a beastfolk?", they have an extremely hard time codifying nay standards of beauty.</p>
<p>This has resulted in Sylvins generally not caring what other people think is attractive, and caring only for their own tastes and desires. An interesting drawback to this system also found within Sylvin culture is most people think they are ugly due to not being attractive to themselves. This phenomenon bears further study.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Values">Values</h4>
<p>Sylvin culture places a great value on loyalty. More so than other cultures, one is ment to be a part of the group, a facet of the nation. They are to know their duties to their community and perform them. This makes general sloth and selfishness the most despised traits in Sylvin culture. The result of these preferences has created a culture of hard workers whose leisure activities are often monetized as many people cannot see actions which are not in some way benefiting society, their family, or themselves as being worthwhile. A great deal of double think occurs to enable people to believe they are being useful by reading fantasy novels after work, and a great much more effort goes into finding some way to monetize those readings. (Radio-Readers, a profession where one reads a book over the radio in exchange for donations, has become a popular hobby in the current era.)</p>

<div style="margin-left: 3%;">
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Patriotism">Patriotism</h4>
<p>Sylvin culture has remained unchanged in terms of patriotism since the height of the First Sylvin Empire. In times of war, everyone is expected to drop everything and turn their full attention and physical capabilities to the war effort. This is often what occurs, as nothing unites Sylvins quite as well as a common enemy whose declared war on them.</p>
<p>Peacetime is more chaotic. Everyone is expected to know and perform their civic duties. Unfortunately, without some active and ongoing event to unite against many Sylvin find their attention wandering to personal matters rather than public ones. Thus, there are many people whose entire job is to ensure people are "hyped up" about civic matters and current national events. This has the unfortunate side effect of creating culture wars within Sylvin Culture. The practice is something many hate, but disrupting it has proven to not only be challenging but also started its own culture war.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Diversity">Diversity</h4>
<p>Sylvin culture is notable for one rather interesting aspect. Its members genuinely do not care what species someone is. An immigrant who wishes to become a part of Sylvin culture will be accepted without question so long as they change their behavior to fit in with everyone else. Color, sex, gender, and nationality matter not to Sylvins. They care only about one's creed. This makes their culture the most diverse culture in the known world in terms of species comprising the culture.</p>
<p>Their sex-based curse has also ensured their culture is entirely egalitarian. Though many find that the term inadequate as egalitarianism is the acknowledgment that the sexes are of equal value, while Sylvins seemingly only care what someone's sex and gender is for the purposes of having children in the most biological of senses.</p>
<p>There is a roomer amongst several other cultures that one of the two thousand true Wood Elves moved to the Sylvanian Empire after having a change of heart and were entirely accepted into the culture. Attempts to prove this roomer have proven fruitless, though an official statement from Empress Kleis the Second was found on the subject:</p>
<div class="quotebox">
<p>Of this matter, I will say only that should a Wood Elf wish to change their ways and live in peace, we would accept them and protect their identity from those who would wish them harm. The policy of this crown on their race is they are insane, and thus, should one come back to the shores of sanity, their actions were not their own, and they may find a life of peace within our borders. If I may speak as a woman and not your monarch for a moment, the very idea this situation could ever occur is beyond absurd. It simply will not happen. Yet, should it ever come to pass, you have heard our policy on the matter. Those who come after me may think differently, as is their right.</p>

</ol>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="FamilyStructures">Family Structures</h4>
<p>Families are typically patriarchal in Sylvin culture. At least, as much as they can be. In truth, there is no exact word for their system. Presently mascuarchal is being proposed as an official term, though it is unlikely to be chosen for many scholastic reasons.</p>
<p>The system is described simply in that whoever is the most behaviorally describable as masculine within a Sylvin household is the head of the household, regardless of any of their physical traits. This is a clear growth from the ancient human custom of patriarchal households. Yet, unlike most cultures with a clear gender basis for family structure, the "leader" role is used almost entirely within a democratic process as a mediator and tiebreaker who has no vote of their own.</p>
<p>This is due to family being seen as the absolute most important thing within Sylvin culture. Your family, its standing, its power, and its dominion are simply paramount to one's own importance to others. Any action one takes colors their family and vise versa. Hence, families will vote on courses of action, plan with one another on how to improve their lives, and otherwise act as a unit.</p>
<p>Of course, families are defined as parent-child households. Most Sylvin families do not include grandparents or great-grandparents. Those that do are usually only found in rural areas which lack elder care programs. This is in great contrast to most of Eyom's other cultures.</p>
<p>Also in contrast to Eyoms other cultures is the process by which new families are forged. Sylvin culture emphasizes marrying young, though in the modern era many people remain unwed whether or not they have a life partner. The traditional courtship process beings when a child leaves their parent's home on their first day as an adult. From this moment on, the individual will search for someone they love, trust, and have reproductive compatibility with in order to form a new family unit within their community by the birth of their first child.</p>
<p>This is problematic for many Sylvin people who are for lack of a better term, homosexual. IE they are only attracted to people whose sex is the same as their own. These individuals are generally not seen as being families within Sylvin culture. Not out of malice, but due to not having children. This is an issue that can be entirely solved with adoption, as Sylvin culture sees no difference between an adopted child and a biological one. However, if a couple does not wish to raise children, they will be the subject of gossip and low-level disapproval from their neighbors.</p>
<p>A notable recent event relating to same-sex Sylvin couples who wish to be childless is a Constructi company has elected to manufacture Zomnani constructs in the form of Sylvin children to serve as housemates for such couples out of a perceived "easy patch to the bug" as they put it.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 3%;">
<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="PregnancyBirthAndMotherhood">Pregnancy, Birth, and Motherhood</h5>
<p>Motherhood is a very loose, nearly non-existent concept within Sylvin culture. As a decidedly masculine and outwardly male individual can be the biological mother of a child just as anyone else can be, many people dislike the terms mother and father since they are gendered concepts. Thus, the term parent is often used by everyone save for the individual's child, who will know what term their parents prefer.</p>
<p>As motherhood is for all practical purposes universal to Sylvins, there are no stigmas to anything relating to the female side of reproduction. A lumberjack suffering from piriod cramps is simply relegated to a light duty for the day. Gynecology is included in every Sylvan-made health package, and welfare programs exist for couples who have children but lack breasts for nursing their offspring.</p>
<p>All pregnant people are viewed as important and worth protecting. The health of their unborn children is paramount and fully understood by all, as everyone has had someone in their close friend group be pregnant at some point or another. Most public spaces have ample seating expressly reserved for pregnant individuals who need to sit down, and large Sylvin settlements even have 24 hour shops on street corners to enable those with cravings at odd times of the night to sate their appetite. Neighbors offering to care for newborns for a night or two to allow parents to get adequate sleep is a common Sylvin practice.</p>
<p>Many non-Sylvins move to Sylvin communities for the duration of their own pregnancies simply to avoid their own cultures' hangups, hassles, and inadequate healthcare. They often end up immigrating when their entire neighborhood pitches in to assist the new mother in acquiring everything necessary for raising their child. Many non-Sylvins also greatly like the fact that a large burly Sylvin man has carried several children of their own, and consequently would never insult them for being debilitated by the various cramping, swelling, and body aches that often accompany pregnant women.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="ComingOfAge">Coming of Age</h5>
<p>Sylvin culture has chosen 16 as its age of adulthood. This has remained unchanged for nearly 800 years, and many people in the modern age believe it is no longer enough time to ensure someone has learned everything they need to learn to survive and thrive in the modern world. Unfortunately, Sylvin culture's grip of tradition is mighty indeed. The most people with this opinion can do is allow their children to live with them for a few years after their cultural age of adulthood. That said, the age is likely to remain 16 for many years to come.</p>
<p>Sylvin culture celebrates three milestones in a child's life: birth, puberty, and coming of age. Birth is important for reasons unrelated to the child itself, but puberty and the coming of age are jsut as important to the family as the child themselves. Due to the curses placed on Sylvins, there is no way to know whether a child will be masculine or feminine or have male or female secondary sexual characteristics until they have finished puberty. Thus the start of puberty is seen as the first true development of the child into an actual person.</p>
<p>The 16th birthday, when puberty has finished for most individuals, is seen as the first day a person is truly themselves. Sylvin culture celebrates this, and has traditionally opened the world to them, sending them out into the world to develop into whoever they will be now that their body is finished "developing" as they call it.</p>
<p>This is rooted in a deeply held and ancient belief that states that parents are to install morality, ethics, and care for their child, but they have no right to dictate what that child likes or dislikes. While not everyone follows this ancient tradition, the age of adulthood being so low typically ensures that Sylvin adults find themselves much earlier in life than other cultures members do. Most Sylvins have an idea of who they want to be and what they like doing by the time they are 20.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="LoveAndRomance">Love and Romance</h5>
<p>Sylvin culture holds the love between friends in the highest esteem. Of the different varieties of friendly love, eros [Passionate Love, found in physical pleasure] is seen as the most important and sacred type of bond. Consequently, SYlvins tend to wed their best friend, with younger Sylvins much more likly to not care about anything other than their love for their partner (Older generations would generally wed their closest friend to whom they felt attraction and could have children with. These younger individuals who work by this practice will often turn to another, less loved friend for the purposes of having a child, and raise the resulting child with their spose with the spouse's approval and blessing.). The love found between family members is seen as important, but nowhere near as much as that of friends. Interestingly, even if Sylvins are friends but not romantic partners, they typically express very close and loving bonds, often even stronger than that of family.</p>
<p>Sylvin culture traditionally favors monogamy. Monogamy is the practice of having only one sexual/romantic partner at time. Monogamous couples can be married or not married - the partners just agree that they will not have sex with anyone else while they are in this relationship. In the last 50 years, polyamory has been gaining traction as the traditional views of love and the wider social groups of the modern day have begun to cause distress and despair for younger Sylvins as they often need to choose between many possible spouses, all of whom they truly love. While urban centers have remained traditional, rural Sylvin areas have begun to fully support polyamorious families.</p>
<p>According to legend, this change appears to have begun after a traveling goblin was used as the subject for a Sylvin venting their romantic frustrations, and responded "... Why not just marry each of them? Or none of them but all of you get your own little house and just love each other and be a family?" to which there was apparently no good answer, so the sylvin did just that, and it worked out for everyone involved.</p>
<p><b>Manual Prompt:</b>What are typical acts of romance?</p>
<p><b>Manual Prompt:</b>What romantic celebrations are there?</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="Sexuality">Sexuality</h5>
<p>Sylvin culture has a complicated relationship with sexuality. Not due to any taboos, but due to the plethora of options available to all who seek a romantic partner. The full details and range of possibilities are not easily listable, but suffice to say that any arrangement of primary and secondary sexual characteristics can be found with any particular gender expression one desires. They need only search a little longer for the more rare varieties.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sylvin culture has many different professions designed to help individuals locate compatible partners. There are even spells designed to help guide people to the nearest settlement containing an individual they would find attractive.</p>
<p>Of course, while finding a lover is seen as romantic and noble, expressing that love with a lover asside from a hug, kiss, or handholding (and similar activities) in public spaces is seen as obscene and crude. This has nothing to do with the sexes or appearances of the people involved. It's simply that Sylvins dislike overt displays of sexual affection in public spaces. Notably, people's yards and homes do not count as public spaces in Sylvin culture. This results in an oddly puritan public square which one can reach by walking down streets filled with couples expressing their love for one another in all sorts of ways other cultures might find lewd. (Outright sex in these areas is almost never observed, but this appears to be due to a general desire for intimacy during such acts rather than any public upset).</p>
<p>Most other cultures would find this most disagreeable if not for the Sylvan culturally mandated privacy fences and hedges. Each yard is almost impossible to look into on accident.</p>

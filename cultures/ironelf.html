<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="ArtHistory">Art</h5>
</div>
<p>The majority of Iron Elvish's art is primarily commissioned by members of the government and their chosen elites. Artistic endevors are majority funded independently, while artists themselves are generaly treated poorly. Iron Elvish uses the majority of its art to chalange the status quo, primarily by questioning the legitimacy of an authority. Iron Elvish also uses its art for: creating new cultural norms, immortalizing key events of history, providing illustrations of academic concepts, celebrating historic events, and remembering the dead.</p>
<p>Iron Elvish's major laws relating to the creation of art are; may not directly criticize the government, and may not posativly depict national rivals and state enamies. Art is concidered to be taboo if it containg oxplatives or other obseen content, conveys erotic feelings, or depicts violence. Works which are either illegal or taboo are destroyed.</p>
<p>Presently, the Iron Elvish greatly favor the visual arts. They primarily focused on drawing, with their greatest works consisting of rapidly executed freehand drawings, typically created to capture a moment by the artist, with their quality somewhat diminished due to the speed of their creation, however the focus is more on the subject rather than the quality itself. Their art showed a particular emphasis on colors, texture, and value. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the artist  space, texture, and forms hues, value, and colors poems with a structure that uses refrains and callbacks as a means to emphasize the importance of particular lines to the overall poem. This form of poem is almost exclusively used to tell a grand and epic story, generally depicting mythological or heroic events poems written in the fashion of traditional folk ballads, in essence, a song without music to accompany it. This form of poem is almost exclusively used to tell a grand and epic story, generally depicting mythological or heroic events plays consisting primarily of songs which have been expanded upon with distinct rolls and actors, usually to tell a story, but occasionally to recant events, or codify mythology and often with each song being written expressly to tell a part of the play's story plays consisting primarily of songs which have been expanded upon with distinct rolls and actors, usually to tell a story, but occasionally to recant events, or codify mythology and often with each song being written expressly to tell a part of the play's story, whose works are typicaly the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Iron Elvish's artwork of the current era.</p>
<p>In the Literary Arts, they primarily focused on literary fiction, with their greatest works consisting of a form of written work which emphasizes interior characterization and motivation to explore the spiritual, emotional, and metal lives of the characters within.

<p>In the Preforming Arts, they primarily focused on music, with their greatest works consisting of a monophonic style which is diatonic in tone, while favoring quiet to very loud to quiet Heavy sounds with movements generally  making use of eight-note melodies utilizing subordinate harmony with a flowing rhythm, all arranged in a verse-repeating structure which extends the piece by repeating a specific section several times..

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="PopCulture">Pop Culture</h5>
<p>Iron Elvish's popular culture is dominated by painting and music. These arts are made avalible to the public through capitalist ventures. They are primarily used for decoration and providing some background noise of a pleasent nature in a mot typical arangment. Howeaver the elves do not particulary see these fields as art, bur rather tools. To them, art is science and engineering.</p>
<p>The elves' ongoing march of progress and technology is eccentialy the same as the ebb and flow of their popculture. Various ideas come in and out of fashion, and certain expressions of a technique become niesh intrests. For example, when 3 axis milling was invinted it enjoied a boom of fans and enthusiests using it simply to learn it. This quickly died down as pnumatic powered tools became in fashion. Those who needed to mill for their work or employment continued to do so, but many stuck with milling simply for the love of working with the machines, developing new techniques and tooling to use with them.</p>
<p>Iron Elves simply see art, entertainment, and craftsmenship as inseperable.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="HighCulture">High Culture</h5>
<p>Iron Elvish's high culture is dominated by painting and literature. These arts are made avalible to members of the cultural eliet through public trusts for the arts. Much like their pop culture, these elements are predominantly for decoration. The diffrence comes from high art being seen as master crafted examples of decorative work. This elevates the pieces in the elves' eyes, as well as their act of creation. Yet they still prefer more utilitarian forms of art in terms of what other peoples would think of as "art".</p>
<p>Most of these works are publicly accessable in muciums and galleries </p>

The poor despise the wealthy, seeing them as the source of their personal woes, while the wealthy generaly dislike the conditions of those poorer than them. Opertunities for scocial mobility exist for the well educated, and Iron Elvish communities have a fairly decent ratio of wealthy to poor citizens. Broadly speaking, education is avalible to most of scociety, carrer options are restricted by class [with some exceptions], homes and family-related infrastructure avalible to most citizens, healthcare is avalible to most at resonable prices, and anyone with wealth can gain scocial or political power.</p>

<p>Iron Elvish cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, seafood and meats. Dairy is largely absent from the traditional Iron Elvish diet.

Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, fermented bean paste, soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, pepper flakes, fermented red chili paste, and cabbage. Ingredients and dishes vary by settlment. Many regional dishes have become national, and dishes that were once regional have proliferated in different variations across the cultrual zone. A notable soverign tradition is for the highest ranking government officials to eat all of the unique regional specialties, which are brought together in state capitols for this purpose.</p>

Donations are typicaly made to assist the impoverished, with notably less going to other groups in need.</p>
<p>As with all of Eyom's cultures, general wellfare is of excelent quality and reach. Food and shelter programs are ubiquitious, even if only to ensure all able-bodies members of scociety are healthy enough to be laborers.

These institutions are typicaly backed by Gnollish banks, though most nations have set up their own financial institutions to handle these programs affairs more effishently.

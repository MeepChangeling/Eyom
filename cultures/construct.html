<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="ArtHistory">Art</h5>
</div>
<p contenteditable="true">The majority of Constructi's art is almost entirely commissioned by members of the government and their chosen elites. Artistic endevors are partly funded through public trusts, while artists themselves are generaly treated as tools. Constructi uses the majority of its art as a form of leaisure, primarily by celebrating historic events. Constructi also uses its art for: making certain concepts easier to understand for children, questioning authority, reinforcing cultural norms, chronicling the culture's journey through history, and beautification of private spaces.</p>
<p>Constructi's major laws relating to the creation of art are; must be authorised by all relevent athorities if the art is to be publicly displayed, and may not depict obceen acts. Art is concidered to be taboo if it conflicts with generaly held beliefs, containg oxplatives or other obseen content, or depicts nudity. Works which are either illegal or taboo are ignored.</p>
<p>Presently, the Constructi greatly favor the visual arts. They primarily focused on print making, with their greatest works consisting of images created by covering a metal plate in wax, which the artist then draws in by cutting away some of the wax. An acid is then applied to the plate, which eats away at the exposed metal. Once the image is acid etched, the plate is carefully painted with inks and applied to other media via stamping. This method produces extremely sharp and detailed lines. Their art showed a particular emphasis on texture and shapes. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the printer , whose works are typicaly the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Constructi's artwork of the current era.</p>
<p>In the Literary Arts, they primarily focused on literature, with their greatest works consisting of written works covering journeys, adventures, and daily life taking place in the rural and remote places of the world, generally written by adventurers and explorers in the form of diaries. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the author , whose works are typically the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Constructi's artwork of the current era.</p>
<p>In the Preforming Arts, they primarily focused on music, with their greatest works consisting of a monophonic style which is atonal in tone, while favoring very loud to loud to loud Thick sounds with movements generally  making use of paterns of eight and ten note long melodies utilizing subordinate harmony with a flowing rhythm, all arranged in an arrangement centered around a theme which is varied on as the pieces of the arrangement progress through times.. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the musicisian , whose works are typically the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Constructi's artwork of the current era.</p>

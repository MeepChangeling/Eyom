</div>
<p>The majority of Rosid's art is essentially commissioned by members of the government and their chosen elites. Artistic endevors are generally funded through patrons, while artists themselves are generaly treated with respect. Rosid uses the majority of its art for educational purposes, primarily by making certain concepts easier to understand for children. Rosid also uses its art for: combating economic agendas, ridiculing cultural norms, immortalizing key figures of history, celebrating historic events, and remembering loved ones.</p>
<p>Rosid's major laws relating to the creation of art are; may not directly criticize the government, and may not posativly depict national rivals and state enamies. Art is concidered to be taboo if it sexualizes the subjects, depicts violence against children, or containg oxplatives or other obseen content. Works which are either illegal or taboo are enshrined by those it resonates with, and dessicrated by those it provokes.</p>
<p>Presently, the Rosid greatly favor the visual arts. They primarily focused on print making, with their greatest works consisting of images printed onto various mediums, usually cloth, via the use of a fine mesh screen and sets of stencils, which prevent inks or paints from passing through the screen onto the medium. Their art showed a particular emphasis on lines, forms, and value. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the printer  space, texture, and forms hues, value, and colors poems with a structure that uses refrains and callbacks as a means to emphasize the importance of particular lines to the overall poem. This form of poem is almost exclusively used to tell a grand and epic story, generally depicting mythological or heroic events poems written in the fashion of traditional folk ballads, in essence, a song without music to accompany it. This form of poem is almost exclusively used to tell a grand and epic story, generally depicting mythological or heroic events plays consisting primarily of songs which have been expanded upon with distinct rolls and actors, usually to tell a story, but occasionally to recant events, or codify mythology and often with each song being written expressly to tell a part of the play's story plays consisting primarily of songs which have been expanded upon with distinct rolls and actors, usually to tell a story, but occasionally to recant events, or codify mythology and often with each song being written expressly to tell a part of the play's story I̊dwůh́, whose works are typicaly the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Rosid's artwork of the current era.</p>
<p>In the Literary Arts, they primarily focused on literature, with their greatest works consisting of a multitude of written works, grouped together into a genera and medium by the restrictions placed upon the author for writing a specific work.

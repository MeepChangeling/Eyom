</div>
<p>The majority of Wood Elven's art is usually only commissioned by academics and universities. Artistic endevors are primarily funded by the state, while artists themselves are generaly treated as a means to an end. Wood Elven uses the majority of its art as a general faset of everyday life, primarily by remembering the dead. Wood Elven also uses its art for: celebrating life, making certain concepts easier to understand for children, questioning authority, examining cultural norms, and immortalizing key events of history and mythology.</p>
<p>Wood Elven's major laws relating to the creation of art are; may not directly criticize government officials, and must be authorised by all relevent athorities if the art is to be publicly displayed. Art is concidered to be taboo if it depicts violence against children, depitcs certain bodily functions, or depicts violence. Works which are either illegal or taboo are enshrined by those it resonates with, and dessicrated by those it provokes.</p>
<p>Durring this Cycle, the Wood Elven greatly favored the literary arts. They primarily focused on literature, with their greatest works consisting of written works taking the form of the account of the life of the author. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the author  space, texture, and forms hues, value, and colors poems with a structure that uses refrains and callbacks as a means to emphasize the importance of particular lines to the overall poem. This form of poem is almost exclusively used to tell a grand and epic story, generally depicting mythological or heroic events poems written in the fashion of traditional folk ballads, in essence, a song without music to accompany it. This form of poem is almost exclusively used to tell a grand and epic story, generally depicting mythological or heroic events plays consisting primarily of songs which have been expanded upon with distinct rolls and actors, usually to tell a story, but occasionally to recant events, or codify mythology and often with each song being written expressly to tell a part of the play's story plays consisting primarily of songs which have been expanded upon with distinct rolls and actors, usually to tell a story, but occasionally to recant events, or codify mythology and often with each song being written expressly to tell a part of the play's story I̊dwůh́ H́åch́ayḿ H́åhkah́ik Poland Gardiner Howfield, whose works are typically the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Wood Elven's artwork of the current era.</p>
<p>In the Visual Arts, they primarily focused on print making, with their greatest works consisting of images created by covering a metal plate in wax, which the artist then draws in by cutting away some of the wax. An acid is then applied to the plate, which eats away at the exposed metal. Once the image is acid etched, the plate is carefully painted with inks and applied to other media via stamping. This method produces extremely sharp and detailed lines. Their art showed a particular emphasis on value, hues, and colors.

<p>The majority of Warrenese's art is effectively only commissioned by members of the government. Artistic endevors are primarily funded independently, while artists themselves are generaly treated with respect.

Warrenese also uses its art for: celebrating life, illuminating texts for ease of understanding, combating political agendas, creating new cultural norms, and immortalizing key figures of history and mythology.</p>
<p>Warrenese's major laws relating to the creation of art are; may not posativly depict national rivals and state enamies, and must be authorised by all relevent athorities if the art is to be publicly displayed. Art is concidered to be taboo if it sexualizes the subjects, depicts violence against children, or containg oxplatives or other obseen content. Works which are either illegal or taboo are ignored.</p>

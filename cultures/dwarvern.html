<p>Dwarvern Culture is one of Eyom's major cultures. It's reach covers 869,918 square kilometers in western coast of Eyom, and is comprised of aproximently 16,122,189 individuals in urban centers.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 26%;">
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Scociety">Scociety</h4>
<p>Dwarven Culture is enagmatic and difficult to study due to the nature of dwarves being hazardious to other forms of life. Most of what is known comes from observing the peoples of the lands above them, and limited interactions with Dwarves visiting the surfice (as well as those who live near it).</p>

<div style="margin-left: 24%;">
<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="ArtHistory">Art</h5>
</div>
<p>The majority of Dwarvern Culture's art is exclusively commissioned by members of the government. Artistic endevors are minimally funded through public trusts, while artists themselves are generaly treated with great respect. Dwarvern Culture uses the majority of its art as a general facet of everyday life, primarily by remembering loved ones. Dwarvern Culture also uses its art for: as a means of storytelling, making certain concepts easier to understand, questioning authority, examining cultural norms, and chronicling the culture's journey through history.</p>
<p>Dwarvern Culture's major laws relating to the creation of art are;</p>
<div class="quotebox">
  <p>No work of art may posativly depict national rivals and/or state enamies.</p>
  <p>Artowrks may not accuratly depictict millitary infrasturcture.</p>
</div>
<p>Art is concidered to be taboo if it conveys erotic feelings, directly criticize the government, or depicts violence against children. Works which are either illegal are destroyed, those that are taboo are cencored. This cencorshi often does not involve the removal of the artwork, or alteration, but rather in covering the artwork, usualy with a tarp. The art is then concidered to be "Dead" and none acknolage its existance.</p>
<p>Presently, Dwarvern Culture culture greatly favors the preforming arts. They primarily focused on theater, with their greatest works consisting of plays which are created largely in the spur of the moment during the performance by the actors based on what other actors are saying and doing, with the story being intentionally chaotic. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the thespian Nil ​Cåqcebackhu, whose works are typically the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Dwarvern Culture's artwork of the current era.</p>
<p>In the Visual Arts, they primarily focused on print making, with their greatest works consisting of images created by an artist intinsly laboring over a metal plate with extremely fine point tools to in essence, draw lines into the metal in a similar fashion as one might draw with graphite on paper, though in this case, by very finly scratching the metal. These extremely fine and shallow lines are then filled with ink, and the image is stamped onto another medium. However the exceptional fineness of the linework prevents the stamp from being used more than a dozen or so times, and only the first few images will be of good quality. Their art showed a particular emphasis on intensity, shapes, and value. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the printer Goggaginn ​Rebckezqug, whose works are typicaly the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Dwarvern Culture's artwork of the current era.</p>
<p>in the Literary Arts, they primarily focused on poetry, with their greatest works consisting of poems written in the fashion of traditional folk ballads, in essence, a song without music to accompany it. Generally the poems created in this style were intended to be amusing, or even comic. The foremost artisan within this medium and time was the poet SL-42T "Tidy" Phodnezerf, whose works are typicaly the first ones thought of and mentioned when discussing the Dwarvern Culture's artwork of the current era.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="PopCulture">Pop Culture</h5>
<p>Dwarvern Culture's popular culture is dominated by drawing and dance. These arts are made avalible to the public through public trusts for the arts.</p>
<p>Dwarvern Popculture remains fixed in its ancient roots and traditions, refusing to change as time gones on. They prioratize and value the creation of more works rather than new works, a stance which is verry difficult for most peoples to relate to or understand. The library of works dedicated to a single figure of Dwarvern myth or fiction can be so extensive that there is not enough time for any one individual to experiance all of their stories.</p>
<p>Dwarves do not tend to draw people, animals, or landscapes. Ratehr they focus on technical drawings, even if said devices are entirly impossible to construct. The beauty in the art for them is in envisioning mechanisums, machines, and systems, and ways in which they can be applied. Concequently, more advanced Dwarvern art is often mistaken for blueprints, leading to the Dwarvern reputation for creating "inherent flaws" within blueprints to prevent their technology form being coppied. This is but a myth, and the other people's engineers are simply attempting to construct a fictional device from a work of wall art.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="HighCulture">High Culture</h5>
<p>Dwarvern Culture's high culture is dominated by archatecture and archatectural emblishings. These arts are made avalible to members of everyone as they comprise the whole of that which Dwarvern scociety constructs in terms of buildings, infrastructure, defencive fortifications, and all other practical works.</p>
<p>Dwarvern Culture venerates their architects, who take the place of famious actors, well known bards, and other "civilian heros" which are venerated and admired by the common folk of the realm. These individuals thus have great followings, with their names being publicly known (and often becoming the middle naems of children), and most people are able to visualy identify their specidic stylings in the world arround them.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="CommunicationAndTheSpreadOfIdeas">Communication And The Spread Of Ideas</h5>
<p>Dwarvern Culture has many forms of advanced communication via magical and technologicla means, all formal communications from legal missives, millitary orders (outside of wartime), and even family letters to keep in touch with relatives are delivered by couriors. This process takes advantage of the Dwarves excelent transportation network, and some of their basic technological and arcane achievments (if the message need cross more distance than a runner can cover in a workshift).</p>
<p>All Dwarvern settlments house a massive library. These libraries are lways public accessable, such that any can come to learn, refresh their memory, or contribute to the "body of public knolage". These libraries are located underground in Dwarvern inhabited zones and are thus unsafe for others to visit or make use of (The city guides within this Encyclopedia only track surfice accessable libraries).</p>
<p>Most Dwarvern Communication is non verbal. They make extensive use of body langauge, sufishent to replace signing in most cases. Their vocal langauge is robust and as compleate as any other people's but is used for addressing many people at once, or otherwise ensuring one's words and thus mind are fully understood. Such cases are used primarily dor conveying new concepts and correcting mistakes or misconceptions.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="Holidays">Holidays</h5>
<p>The major Dwarvern Culture holidays are:</p>
<ol>
<li>harvest festival</li>
<li>fire festival</li>
<li>arcane festival</li>
<li>spirit festival</li>
<li>music festival</li>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="GenderAndGenderRoles">Gender and Gender Roles</h5>
<p>Dwarvern Culture recognises four genders: Engineer, Miner, Pathfinder, and Warrior. We do not as of yet know the diffrence, nor how they are applied to individuals.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="SubculturesAndAlternativeLifestyles">Subcultures and Alternative Lifestyles</h5>
<p>The majority of Dwarves remain underground, but a few do live on the surfice. These individuals are typicaly seen as brash and rogish by their subterranian kin, largly for dwelling in "unsafe" and "exposed" areas. In truth, most of these Ddwarves prefer to live in shallow burrows with direct surfice access, as they are decended from the Dwarves who worked the exterior of mountains (or still work the exteriors) durring the many great projects.</p>
<p>These surfice Dwarves are responcivle for the above ground terratory of Undermountain remaining in Dwarvern hands, as without their presence most people wouldn't know the Dwarves even existed untill accidently tunneling into one of their mines.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="UniversalFears">Universal Fears</h5>
<p>The top five most common fears found within Dwarvern Culture's members are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Devastating Hurricane</li>
<li>Pollution of Oceans, Rivers and Lakes</li>
<li>A distinct and sudden lack of abberations</li>
<li>Being unemployable</li>
<li>Pollution of Drinking Water</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="MoneyAndWealth">Money and Wealth</h4>
<p>In Dwarvern Culture culture, wealth is seen as the primary motovator for non-lieasure actvities. The poor dislike the wealthy, seeing them as wastefull and extravagent, while the wealthy have no real opinions on the poor. Opertunities for scocial mobility exist for the cunning, and Dwarvern Culture communities are supprisingly balanced in terms of income inequality. Broadly speaking, education is avalible to most of scociety, carrer options are avalible for most, homes and family-related infrastructure avalible to most citizens, healthcare is avalible to most at resonable prices, and anyone with wealth can gain scocial or political power.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 3%;">
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Food">Food, Meals, and Mealtime</h4>
<p>Dwarvern Culture's members typicaly eat one large meal at dusk with many small personal snacks throughout the day, which are eaten communialy, with groups of families rotating the responcibility of providing everyone's meals between themselves. This structure appears to be a highly developed worshidft tradition, rooted in the Dwarvern worth ethic, which can see them choosing to work to the point of physical exaustion on occasion. Concequently, this deeply rooted tradition ensures everyone is at least eating once a day.</p>
<p>Dwarvern Culture makes extensive use of potatoes, beans, dairy products and seafood in its cuisiune. Corn [primarily sweet corn although flint corn is grown as well] is also widly used, notably in hasty puddings, cornbreads and corn chowders. Three prominent characteristic foodstuffs native to Dwarvern Culture are maple syrup, cranberries, and blueberries. Traditional Dwarvern Culture cuisine is known for a lack of strong spices. Ground black pepper, parsley, garlic, and sage are common, with a few "exotic" additions such as nutmeg. The favored cooking techniques are stewing, steaming, and baking.</p>
<p>Dwarvern Culture culture has several prominant summer festivals, which are cullinarily significent due to cullinary compitishions being a popular part of the festivals</p>
<p>Not throwin down a mug and demanding a second of whatever the beverage was is seen as shockingly rude, and a jabbing criticism of the brewer and/or host's ability to store and keep beverages. Small (and renforced) mugs are provided for this reason. Dwarvern culture has yet to realise they ought to renforce their various tabletops.</p>
<p>Dwarves believe that Goblin food will make you sick. This is, in many cases, correct. Howeaver for Dwarves this belief extends to anything invinted by Goblins (even if safe for other species), or perpared by goblins. A goblin pefectly cooking a traditional dwarven banquit, making no errors nor deviations could not escape this stigma. This exact situation was the start of one of the many Dwarvern/Goblin wars.</p>
<p>Dwarves concider the age of adulthood to be the point where one is capable odf drinking an entire keg of ale in a day. The youth is made to do exactly that, so they know why not to do it. On a workday.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Leisure">Leisure</h4>
<p>Dwarvern Culture's members typicaly prefer to a decent balance between labor and liesure which favors liesure, which is a pleasure regurlarly enjoied by everyone who isn't a general laborer, and less frequently by the the working class, though plenty of average people still find time for recreation.</p>
<p>Popular adult pasttimes include:</p>
<ol>
<li>pyrography</li>
<li>foreign language learning</li>
<li>refinishing</li>
<li>machining</li>
<li>playing musical instruments</li>
</ol>
<p>Popular pasttimes for children include:</p>
<ol>
<li>diorama</li>
<li>jigsaw puzzles</li><
<li>furniture building</li>
<li>playing musical instruments</li>
<li>string figures</li>
</ol>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="Charity">Charity and Wellfare</h5>
<p>In Dwarvern Culture culture acts of charity are generaly preformed out of a sence of guilt. Doners are typicaly seen as kind and compassionate individuals by the rest of their culture. Donations are typicaly made to assist the clergy, with notably less going to other groups in need.</p>
<p>As with all of Eyom's cultures, general wellfare is of excelent quality and reach. Food and shelter programs are ubiquitious, even if only due to work rations being free and Dwarves constructing buildings of all kinds because that's just what they do. Programs to assist the poor with accuiring basic nessities such as clothing, tools for their porfession, etc are also quite common. These institutions are typicaly backed by Gnollish banks, though most nations have set up their own financial institutions to handle these programs affairs more effishently. Such acts are seen as a means of keeping scociety at large healthy and prosperious by limiting non-contributors to those who either cannot, or simply will not be productive mebers of scociety.</p>


<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="HealthFitnessAndBeautyStandards">Health, Fitness, and Beauty Standards</h5>
<p>Reguardles sof one's physical apperance, build, or shape, Dwarves concider individuals to be physicaly healthy if they can reduce a boulder to rubble within 3 minutes, using only common hand tools. Or explosives, if you're Constructi.</p>
<p>In terms of mental health, Dwarves do not care much about the details and nuance of the minds of people. So long as a brother can work and sing with their work crew, they are seen as prefectly fine in Dwarvern eyes. Individuals may ahve problems, and these problems are often addressed by their friends, but largly, mental health isn't seen as something to obsess over.</p>
<p>Dwarvern culture has an idea of an "ideal body". When rendered as an illistration for our scholars, the image was simply a mining drill.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Values">Values</h4>
<p>Dwarvern Culture has a divinely granted purpose, namly, reducing the number of mountains in Eyom to a more reasonable state. This mission was one of the last dictates of the Old Gods, one of whom created both the Dwarvern Panthion (by elevating specific Kami), and instructing and overseeig the creation of the Dwarves themselves.</p>
<p>Thus, Dwarves see the process fo mining, levling mountains, grading terrain, and generaly speaking, "digging holes" as the only true thing of worth in the world. It is a very alien mindset to interact with, yet properly understanding that the Dwarves will happily give you all of their excess mined goald in exchange for all of your excess potatos is perfectly reasonable to their eyes. They only care about things which will allow the great work to continue.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 3%;">
<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Patriotism">Patriotism</h4>
<p>Dwarven Kingdoms are divinly mandated administrative zones. Each has a function, or functions, which it performs out of a sense of duity. Thus, Dwarves do not have any sort of patriotism, or evne pride in their contry as others see it. They see nations and states as cogs within the machine of a nation, and a nation as the people united under a common goal, rather than a state or government.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Diversity">Diversity</h4>
<p>Dwarven Culture welcomes anyone who wishes to move to the surfice above their lands to live and work there as they please. So long as they follow the laws of the surfice and do not interfeer with any of the great works. They do not care if those who come practice their own religion, culture, and ways. To the Dwarves, the surfice dwellers are there to provide them with that which cannot be obtained within their halls of stone.</p>
<p>Howeaver, due to dwarvs presence sickening and killing other peoples, Dwarves expressly forbid other species from living within their communities. With the exception of constructs (if shielded from radiation), kobolds (who find radiation basking to be relaxing and revitalizing), and very, very, very rarly, elves.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="IntegrationAndExclusion">Integration and Exclusion</h5>
<p>Eyom's family of Elves are notable in that they do not suffer radiation sickness as most peoples do. They still suffer from the other effects, reduced lifespan, inevetable cancer, and blindness, but do not suffer from the short term effects of exposure. This is due to a form of limited radioresistance, and in the past it was believed that Elves might be able to live with Dwarves if they so chose. The truth was discovered after roughtly a century, and led to a mass purge of elves from Dwarven subterrainan areas.</p>
<p>In an extreemly rare case, some elves are almost as resistant to radiation as Dwarves, and whily they cannot safly live in a Dwarven city, they can partisiapte in a Dwarven work crew. This is still not allowed as no Dwarf would associate with a Wood Elf, and in their own words "Iron Elves try to automate the fun out of everything."</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="Superstitions">Superstitions</h5>
<p>Some superstitions common to Dwarvern Culture culture are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yo-Yos can cause drought if used incorrectly.</li>
<li>If you see or hear an owl, terrible news is coming.</li>
<li>A specific number is so unlucky, no one will even tell you which number it is.</li>
<li>Wearing a charm in the shape of an eye will protect you from the evil eye.</li>
<li>The Kami are listening during awkward silences.</li>
</ol>

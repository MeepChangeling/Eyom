<p>Lycanthropes were humanoids with the ability to turn into animals and animal-humanoid hybrid shapes. Natural lycanthropes were born with this ability and had perfect control over their shapechanging. Afflicted lycanthropes contracted this ability like a curse or disease from another lycanthrope and changed form involuntarily, loosing their minds in the process. The lycanthropic curse was ancient, dating back to the time of the Z̚omans. Even they suffered from it, for the disease was as tenacious as it was old.</p>
<p>For all their arcane knowledge, the Z̚oman were unable to purge it from themselves, nor could the Old Gods answer their prayers for relief. The curse appeared to be an immutable part of the universe itself, willed into existence and perpetuated by some ancient and forgotten power.</p>
<p>The curse would have been eradicated with the Z̚oman during the Irisian war if not for the curse having infected a number of the elves which they had created. When the elves were released from their creator's laboratory, some chose to follow Illia, others chose to follow Irus, and a number chose to go their own way, foraging into the wilderness without pledging themselves to either god. The lycanthropes left with the third group, spreading across Eyom in the days before recorded history and multiplying with each failed kill and child born.</p>
<p>By the year 0, lycanthropes blighted the fringes of civilization in the early years of the current age. It was believed their curse would last forever, blighting mortals and cursing many to become unwilling serial killers. Some even believed that eventually, all people would succumb to lycanthropy. This brought the curse to the attention of the young god Khristos.</p>

	<p class="typed"><b>Khristos:</b> I'm sorry. I'm reading this report I was given this morning on lycanthropes. May we please disuss it for a moment?</p>
	<p class="typed"><b>The Court:</b> If it will help you focus on your lessons... What need be discussed?</p>
	<p class="typed"><b>Khristos:</b> Two small items. If there are more transformations than wolves, why are all of these classified as lycanthropes? Lycan means wolf... And thrope means human. A lycanthrope can be almost any animal, and of any race. The name is bad. Can we change it?</p>
	<p class="typed"><b>The Court:</b> A fair argument, my Lord. We'll have someone attend to it.</p>
	<p class="typed"><b>Khristos:</b> Great! Last part, and this is what I've been hung up on. Sorry. It's just... This report is not clear on weather or not the actions of an individual while transformed are within their control or not. Do you know which it is?</p>
	<p class="typed"><b>The Court:</b> Lycanthropes loose their mind when they transform, sir. They become as savage beasts. Even those which transform into an herbivore will seek the flesh of intelligent creatures.</p>

	<p style="float:right;">— Exerpt from Kami Court case 209. 1343 hours, 3/9/02</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Khristos was successful at bending the curse towards his will, but did not fully change it. The afflicted who lacked control over their forms gained the ability to transform as they pleased, and hold their forms as they wished. However, both groups's minds were changed. The afflicted kept their intelligence during their transformations, but their personalities became less... civilized.</p>
<p>Their violence was, fortunately, quite tempered. Few complained about the change in so far as it happened, though many people became quite upset with individual lycans who elected to begin marking their territory, yell at the moon, and other things animals do regardless of what form they were in.</p>
<p>The kami, angry with Lord Khristos for his juvinal use of power (as the god's barely controlled power shave put all of reality at risk several times in the past), elected to rename lycanthropes to Waer-ûl, which still means "wolf-human". Khristos was so upset by this that the god Irus uncharacteristically felt bad for the young god, and in his own words "threw him a bone" by warping the curse himself such that there all Waer-ûl's forms became canid. To this day, it remains the only time Irus did anything for someone else which wasn't some form of trick, prank, or disguised curse. (Scholars believe the name really bothered him too).</p>
<p>Perhaps in an attempt to make the lycan curse's alterations into something all four gods could unite over, the Goddess Tol made her own change, removing the curse's communicability, making it something exclusively passed from parent to children. Illia was then goaded into making her own change by Khristos, and the Engineer's Goddess chose to bless all Waer-ûl with the ability to understand urban centers, ruins, and the dungeon strata as they understood natural biomes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the four gods never did anything together again. Hope that the gods may find common ground and create a pantheon was rekindled when the Goddess Thekel was resurrected. Lord Irus informed her of the Waer-ûl, and how it was a community project and she should contribute. Thekel had never been invited to participate in a group project before, and thus uncharacteristically chose to bless the Waer-ûl with her physique, that all of them would be well muscled, strong, enduring creatures when in their trasnsformed states.</p>
<p>Sadly, this was the last of it. The living gods, Thekel Included, have never united around anything since.</p>
<p>Through the centuries, the Waer-ûl have managed to thrive, forming small hamlets, camps, and tribes in rural areas (They especially enjoy the uppermost layers of the dungeon strata). They largely keep to themselves, as their natural inclinations prevent them from being fully accepted by most societies (though Goblins and Gnolls don't mind them one bit).</p>
<p>Most Waer-ûl believe they exist for a purpose, and that purpose is to related to the five divines. Clearly something about them brought the gods together, even the malicious and self-centered Irus. Their goal as a people is simple: Quest.</p>
<p>For what? Anything. Everything. Something in this world involving them brough tthe gods together. Some fragment of potential? A glimpse of the future wherein one of them would be key to something of importance? Perhaps if the gods are to unify, and Irus to heal from his madness, the Waer-ûl are to pave the way. Or, maybe, if their kind achieves true greatness, and their numbers grow, then their veneration of the five will bring that pantheon into existence, and tame the beast within Irus, as the beast within their ancestors was tamed by Khristos.</p>
<p>Or maybe the five just like dogs. In which case, as dog people, they should keep doing dog people things. In any case, Waer-ûl adventurers are a very common sight in Eyom.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Personality</em></strong></h4>
<p>Waer-ûl retain the general personality of whatever people their base form is. Their behavior is simply modified with canine traits. They are generally more excitable, more territorial, more physically active, and exhibit certain animal behaviors as territorial marking, play fighting, yelling at strangers in their territory, crying at the moon, and preferring to use their sense of smell and hearing rather than sight.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Physical Description</em></strong></h4>
<p>Waer-ûl are shapeshifters with two forms. Their base form is almost identical to their birth species, though notably athletic and toned seemingly without effort. Their other form is a humanoid canine (usually wolf based, but any wild dog is possible as a base) which is exceptionally muscular and toned. Waer-ûl are easily mistaken for Sylvin of the Canis Tribe, an understandable mistake given a Waer-ûl's digigrade legs, tail, coat of fur, ears, and other animal attributes. The primary differences between Waer-ûl and members of Canis are the Waer-ûl's larger fangs and claws, and the Waer-ûl's generally less civilized more animistic behaviors.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Relations</em></strong></h4>
<p>Waer-ûl are quite rare. Approximately 10,000 have been located within the Kiteshield Pennsula, with an estimated 3,000,000 Eyom-Wide. As they are very rare, they are not generally people that other groups have opinions on. More rural communities may know a pack which lives nearby, and generally see them as well meaning savages. This view appears accurate, given the many recorded incidents of Waer-ûl starting fights in towns over minor infractions.</p>
<p>Waer-ûl are generally welcome in most towns, as it's known they are no more dangerous than most hill folk. A few have made a life for themselves as members of communities. These individuals knowledge of surrounding packs, clans, and families are the source of their population estimate.</p>

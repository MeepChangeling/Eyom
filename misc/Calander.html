<h3 class="articletitle">Eyomic Calander</h3>
<article>
<p>The most commonly used Calander in Eyom is the Farmer's Talley, also known as Silva's Calander. It was established by Emperor Silva the First and spread by the First Sylvin Empire as their power spread across the contenent. While all nations have their own calanders, the Farmer's Talley is almsot universaly understood, making it the primary choice for international and buisness use.</p>
<p>The Farmer's Talley is a seasonal Calander, paying no mind to the hours in a day. The Calander's time keeping is solar noon to solar noon, and has been arranged to keep the seasons consistant. The calnder divides the year into 12 months, each with 4 weeks split into 5 days.</p>
<p>The Farmer's Talley is best known for having its year change occure at harvest time. Its zero year is the year the city of Kingsmead (the orgional Silvin Capitol and first human city built Post Irisian War) was compleated. While Sylvin centric, this data is founded in the concept of this being arround the time civilization could thrive on Eyom once more and is used by several calanders.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="PatronArcana">Months</span></h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Material_Plane">Star Gifts</span></h4>
<p>The Farmer's Talley, being a seaosnal calander, is usefull for understanding the phenominon commonly known as Star Gifts. Star Gifts being a mystical force which individuals gain access to a few months to a year after they mentaly mature (Whenever such an event takes place). This attunes the individual to one of the Star Gifts, thus granting the ability associated with their specific Gift by forces yet unknown.</p>.
<p>The Farmer's Tally was in part designed to ensure the varrious Star Gift's associated stellar arangments are in the same posisions in the sky at the same time of year on a year to year basis. As a result of this practice (orgionaly intended to assist with divination) Eyomic peoples tend to celebrate adults lives not on the date of their birth, but on the date an individual gained their Star Gift. This date is known as each individual with a Gift knows the exact night they gained it, as each year on that night they are blessed with peace, good fortune, and a generaly great mood.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Material_Plane">The Skies</span></h4>
<p>The three skies, Living, Dead, and Void are how Eyomic Peoples represent the three Stellar Phases of the year. The Living Sky occures durring winter on Eyom, and is when the night sky is filled with multi-colored and everchanging points of shifting, impossibly distant, magical light. It is seen as a time of thought and inner change by the people of Eyom.</p>
<p>The Dead Sky represents the time of year in which the 42 isolated, static, white stars of the summer sky are the sole lights of the night sky, always visible in their fixed posisions. As with all cultures, this time of year makrs for easy navigation, and is beloved by scholar-mages due to the lower flux of stellar energies. For the people of Eyom, it respresents a time of self improvment through physical means, a time to reflct on the inner world.</p>
<p>The Void Sky refers to the transision piriods between the Living and Dead sky which occure durring spring and fall. This time of year sees no stars in the sky and is seen as a time where the fates hold less sway and that which is ordained might be bent or broken by those strong of will.</p>

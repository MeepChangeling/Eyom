<article>
	<p>The most commonly used Calendar in Eyom is the Farmer's Talley, also known as Silva's Calendar. It was established by Emperor Silva the First and spread by the First Sylvin Empire as their power spread across the continent. While all nations have their own calendars, the Farmer's Talley is almost universally understood, making it the primary choice for international and business use.</p>
	<p>The Farmer's Talley is a seasonal Calendar, paying no mind to the hours in a day. The Calendar's time keeping is solar noon to solar noon, and has been arranged to keep the seasons consistent. The calendar divides the year into 12 months, each with 5 weeks split into 6 days for a total of 30 days each month.</p>
	<p>The Farmer's Talley is best known for having its year change occurs at harvest time. Its zero year is the year the city of Kingsmead (the original Sylvin Capitol and first human city built Post Irisian War) was compleated. While Sylvin centric, this data is founded in the concept of this being around the time civilization could thrive on Eyom once more and is used by several calendars.</p>

	<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="PatronArcana">Months</span></h4>
	<p>The months of the Farmer's Talley are:</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>Full Harvest</li>
	    <li>Frost Fall</li>
	    <li>Longdark</li>
	    <li>Newlight</li>
	    <li>Eweing</li>
	    <li>Half Sowing</li>
	    <li>Full Sowing</li>
	    <li>Gentlesun</li>
	    <li>Highsun</li>
	    <li>Longwheat</li>
	    <li>Toolmend</li>
	    <li>Halfharvest</li>
	</ol>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="PatronArcana">Days</span></h4>
<p>The Farmer's Count's days are named (in order), O, Mu, Ga, Pe, Nano, and Beqi. These are simply the numbers 1-6 in the ancient Zoman language. This lack of day names allows for the efficient if inelegant grid-based date mapping system wherein one can use four numbers to designate any date.</p>
<p>For example, rather than saying or writing "the 15th of Frost Fall in the year 2000" the Farmer's Count allows for "3-3-2-2000" to be used as a means of determining the date. This system works as follows: day - week - month - year. Day 3, week 3 is always the 15th day of the month on the Eyomic Calendar as the months do not change in length, hence, why this can function as it does.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Material_Plane">Star Gifts</span></h4>
<p>The Farmer's Talley, being a seasonal calendar, is useful for understanding the phenomenon commonly known as Star Gifts. Star Gifts being a mystical force which individuals gain access to a few months to a year after they mentaly mature (Whenever such an event takes place). This attunes the individual to one of the Star Gifts, thus granting the ability associated with their specific Gift by forces yet unknown.</p>.
<p>The Farmer's Tally was in part designed to ensure the various Star Gift's associated stellar arrangements are in the same positions in the sky at the same time of year on a year to year basis. As a result of this practice (originally intended to assist with divination) Eyomic peoples tend to celebrate adults lives not on the date of their birth, but on the date an individual gained their Star Gift. This date is known as each individual with a Gift knows the exact night they gained it, as each year on that night they are blessed with peace, good fortune, and a generally great mood.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Material_Plane">The Skies</span></h4>
<p>The three skies, Living, Dead, and Void are how Eyomic Peoples represent the three Stellar Phases of the year. The Living Sky occurs during winter on Eyom, and is when the night sky is filled with multi-colored and ever changing points of shifting, impossibly distant, magical light. It is seen as a time of thought and inner change by the people of Eyom.</p>
<p>The Dead Sky represents the time of year in which the 42 isolated, static, white stars of the summer sky are the sole lights of the night sky, always visible in their fixed positions. As with all cultures, this time of year makes for easy navigation, and is beloved by scholar-mages due to the lower flux of stellar energies. For the people of Eyom, it represents a time of self improvement through physical means, a time to reflect on the inner world.</p>
<p>The Void Sky refers to the transition periods between the Living and Dead sky which occur during spring and fall. This time of year sees no stars in the sky and is seen as a time where the fates hold less sway and that which is ordained might be bent or broken by those strong of will.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Material_Plane">Time Zones</span></h4>

<figure style="width: 60%;" class="left">
<figcaption  class="basic"><b>A map of Eyom's Time Zones.</b></figcaption>
<img style="width:100%" title="A map of Eyom's Time Zones." src="..\img\maps\EyomTimeZones.jpeg" alt="A map of Eyom's Time Zones." />
</figure>

<p>Eyom's citizens felt the need to create large zones with synchronized clock time, regardless of solar time. This was due to their expansive railway network, which made it possible to travel and do business rapidly, and across vast distances. As this concept is unique and related to the passing and tracking of time, it is being detailed here on their callender's page.</p>
<p>The time zones work by adjusting clocks incrementally one hour forwards (if moving west 15) degrees, and one hour back if moving east 15 degrees. Each set of 15 degrees incurs another hour of change. In theory, if one were to reach the opposite side of the world as the Illia Time Zone, the count would invert.</p>
<p>There are seven time zones, Constructi, Titan's, Illia, Dalandic, Merchant's, Western, and True Time. True Time, despite the name, is simply what Wood Elves chose to call the time zone established for their territories as their capitol rests almost on the center of the Illia Time Zone, and they refused to have their holdings on a different time. In effect, they chose not to participate in so far as dividing their territory across times, but respect all other boundaries.</p>
<p>The zones are not even 15 degree slices of the world due to many factors, some political, some translation errors, some simply misunderstanding the concept. Most lines wrap around borders, allowing allies to share time with one another, and creating barriers of separation between rivals and enemies. Or, in the case of the Warrenese, sub dividing one's own territory in 15 minute intervals because clearly that is what this temporal gradient mapped to longitudinal distance was all about.</p>
<p>As if this wasn't enough confusion relating to time, the Time Zone system includes support for a practice of the northernmost folk of the world. As their winters are dark and long, those living above what is called the "Winter Boundary Line" (which rests at 40 degrees N latitude) set their clocks back 4 hours from the start of Frostfall, to the end of Ewing. They then pretend the day starts and stops this 4 hours earlier than it does, entirely ignoring solar noon and lunar midnight. This practice is formally recognised within the Time Zone system, hence in winter if it is 3 pm in Illia Time, it will be 6 pm in Western Time, unless you're 40 degrees or more north, in which case it is 11 am, and 2 am respectively.</p>

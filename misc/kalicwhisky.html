<p>Kalic whisky (also known as Iron Brew) is a traditional <a href="../races/kitsune.html">Kitsune</a> distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Proper Kalic whisky is produced using a grain mixture of 2/3rds barley, 1/6th bere, 1/12th iron oxide, 1/12 iron ore, and trace ammounts of foxglove, yarrow, and elderflowers. The mash is impossible to create without the use of special arcane or chemical knolage which will suspend the metal content into the liquid without the use of deadly and/or off tasting chemicals. Once the mash is fermented, it is distilled and aged in pine barrels for seven years, seven months, and seven days before being bottled. Traditionaly Kalic whisky is stored in stoneware bottles, but in recent times ceramic vessles have been deemed acceptable by traditional brewers.</p>
<p>Kalic whisky is traditionaly carbonated and served cold. It is well known for its distinctive orange color, and its distinct flavor. While the Kitsune describe Kalic whisky's flavor as "Unicorn blood, thistle juice, and the sweet, sweet tears of the Unselee women mourning their dead at Tír na nÓg." The beverage's flavor is that of strawberry, banana, and cherry flavor, a combination many dub "fizzy bubblegum", with good reason.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">It is also known for killing the <i>absolute shit</i> out of anything vulnerable to cold iron. Astonishingly, it is safe to consume for all other known lifeforms, proving to be a refreshing, energizing, and inebriating beverage most people see no need to consume a second time. Those who remain almost inverably have discovered Kalic whisky to be their new drink of choice.</p>
<p>Kalic whisky is well known for being able to allow individuals to surpass the normal limits of a soul, and begin the process of refining one's true self into a more powerful state. While this is something many products and techniques can produce, Kalic whisky is consistant in being able to set people on the path to self enlightnment, albit using it in this fashion requires consuming enough to black out under the light of the full moon. Few people wish to experiance the hangover this induses, or the apparent confrontation of one's inner self in its truest essence the drink can induce, and stick to meditation, trials, and other means of surpassing the mortal barrier into the realm of heros.</p>

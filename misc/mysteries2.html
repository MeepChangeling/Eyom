<p>Eyom is full of mysteries, not only to us, but also its own residents. This article is a collection of some of the most pressing and intriguing secrets of Eyom. Each of these are true mysteries, with cause, purpose, nature, or all of the above unknown.</p>
<p>These riddles have confounded scholars, adventurers, rulers, and citizens alike. Some are benign, some harmful, and a few are beneficial. Some are new, some are old, some are so ancient they are almost a matter of physics.</p>
<p>Anyone who can provide insight into one or more of these happenings, in whole or in part, may lay claim to the reward(s) listed alongside each of the following entries.</p>

<h5 class="articlesubtitle" id="SilverJudges">The Thing</h5>
<p><b>Reward:</b> One wish, granted by Tol herself. No strings attached.</p>
<p><b>Offered by:</b> The Goddess Tol, Guardian of Lin Forest</p>
<p>In the year 212, the Goddess Tol left her forest for what she claimed was the first time. Even if it was not, she has not left Lin Forest again in all of recorded history. Tol walked to the deathbed of Emperor Silva the First, and after plotly poking her eye up to the window, spoke to non-Goblins for the only time in recorded history. Her words, and the last words of Emperor Sylva the Great the are quoted below verbatim:</p>
<div class="quotebox">
  <p>"Addressing Small Wise Leggy One. Distressed Querry: What is the name/function/origin of presented object?"</p>
  <p>"That's a <i>good</i> question."</p>
</div>
<p>The object in question has been the subject of study eversince, and remains on display in the Sylvin University. The Thing primarily consists of a excavated dodecahedron constructed from an unknown material. The unknown material's physical properties consist of a surface so black the object appears to be a silhouette despite being a 3d shape. Sometimes. Other times it is so pearly white yet not be right it appears to be the focal point of a beam of light. Still other times it appears to be a grayish material with the texture of glass, yet the strength and rigidity of steel or soft cheese (depending on happenstance).</p>
<p>This Unknown Matrix's twelve faces contain stuff. Unfortunately, a better description cannot be made as each of the "cubbies" contain a different object, substance, or energy, some entirely known to modern science, arcana, and occult scholars. Each cubby is covered with a hermetically sealed lid, actuated by a knob in the center, and comprised of a translucent material which is both metallic and magnetic. The cubbies contents are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A thick black tar-like substance that smells like the mother of any given individual able to smell it.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>It burns with a pure white flame, but is not consumed.</li>
	<li>It tastes like strawberries, and will kill you within seconds.</li>
	<li>It's very fun to mould into different shapes, and does not dry out.</li>
	<li>Compartment 1 refills with this substance every 3 minutes. All existing substance can be put back into the compartment, regardless of total mass, up to 3000 liters (larger volumes not tested).</li>
  </ol>
  <li>A mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons suspended in a petroleum oil base with trace amounts of carbon dioxide.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>Protects metal from rust and corrosion.</li>
	<li>Displaces water from small crevices.</li>
	<li>Dissolves rust.</li>
	<li>Moderately effective as a lubricating oil.</li>
	<li>Compartment 2 refills with up to 2 liters of this substance every 8.9 minutes if not filled.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Small metallic packets containing peanuts, and metallic cans openable via a tab containing a mediocre pale ale.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>Compartment 3 refills with its refreshments every time it is opened, and contains 6 of each item.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Small cat-sized shoggoth like creatures.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>Harmless.</li>
	<li>Seem to enjoy knocking household items off ledges. Unlike items pushed by housecats, items pushed by the mini-shoggoth do not break on impact with the ground.</li>
	<li>Serve no practical purpose.</li>
	<li>Can bake snacks, but only snacks you dislike.</li>
	<li>Compartment 4 dispences up to 4 of these at a time.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Empty.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>The empty space has a mass of 2.2×10<sup>−27</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup></li>
  </ol>
  <li>A blue ooze with no oder, texture, taste, nor perceptible mass.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>The ooze has mass, and obeys gravity as expected of a thick slimy substance. But appears to have no weight when held, or placed on a scale.</li>
	<li>Appears to have infinite functions and uses, but only while being observed by a single individual. In which case, the ooze can do a single thing for that individual, with no apparent limits. However, the moment the ooze is no longer paid attention to, or a second individual looks at the ooze, the effect stops. Often with catastrophic consequences.</li>
	<li>The compartment always contains 80 ml of the ooze, even if ooze is extracted. It is as if the ooze is duplicated as it is pulled out of the cubby, with the original ooze never moving, nor even being touched.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Infinite copies of a seemingly endless variety of books written in a mixture of languages such that each word comes from a unique language.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>Languages are never re-used within a single volume, but do appear in multiple volumes.</li>
	<li>The language used for a given word is different between different copies of the same book.</li>
	<li>Books appear to cover all known genres of fiction and nonfiction given the covers of those with cover art.</li>
	<li>Many books are existing Eyomic books, but are translated into the myriad languages.</li>
	<li>Attempting to use known works to translate the unknown languages inevitably drives the individual to drink.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>A small hand mirror like object when when placed against any broken object displays a visual recording of the same individual (species and identity unknown) repairing the current problem with a similar object, while speaking in an unknown language.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>Has no effect if no one in Eyom knows how to fix the object in question.</li>
	<li>Frequency analysis has determined the individual's name is "Xifs'irhc".</li>
  </ol>
  <li>A seemingly bottomless pit.</li>
  <li>A small number of cylindrical objects, decorated with painted on runes. Purpose unknown.</li>
  <li>An endless number of ordinary cotton blankets.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>Blankets all measure 4x8 meters in size.</li>
	<li>Most blankets are several layers of plush knit cotton.</li>
	<li>1:137 blankets are quilts.</li>
	<li>All blankets are decorated in styles that are horribly outdated and look "old persony" at the time they are removed.</li>
	<li>A constant supply of blankets can be removed from the Thing.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>A device, which appears to be a radio transceiver and base station, fashioned from bronze, wood, rubber, and other Eyomicly available materials.</li>
  <ol>
	<li>Device's materials are able to be sourced in the modern era, but not at the time the Thing was found.</li>
	<li>The device's inturnals may contain exotic materials, it has never been opened or activated.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>The Thing has several properties unrelated to its contents. The Thing occasionally moves of its own volition. Its locomotion is not magical in nature, nor does it have any observable means of moving through the natural processes by which it nonetheless moves. When it chooses to move, it often simply rolls to put a new compartment on the top face. Occasionally, it may choose to roll into a different room than the one in which it is presently located. Should this occur there are no barriers which can prevent it from doing so. Doors will open, straps will un-clip, locks will open, ropes will untie.</p>
<p>If the Thing is placed in a natural environment, the plantlife will bend to point towards it as if pushed by a gale force wind. If the Thing is placed in the center of a room, the room's temperature self-regulates to a comfortable temperature for all inhabitants, even if such a temperature cannot exist (Fire elementals, ice elementals, and mortals can be comfortable in the same room if the Thing is present).</p>
<p>Sometimes, the thing beeps. Only one person located nearby will hear the beeping, and the beeping will occur intermittently for up to 6 years. 30 minutes is the mean of the beeping durations.</p>
<p>Constructi feel vaguely shy around the Thing, and cannot articulate why. Rattu are generally infuriated by the Thing, but this could be due to not knowing what it is rather than a genuine effect of the thing.</p>
<p>According to various High Elder Priestesses of Tol, Tol found The Thing laying in her garden one afternoon. Apparently, no more than half a step from the bird bath.</p>

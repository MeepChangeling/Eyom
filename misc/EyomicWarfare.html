<h3 class="articletitle">Eyomic Warfare</h3>
<p>Warfare in Eyom is as modern as the rest of the world in terms of the destructive power available to its many Nations, and the general evolution of tactics. Any world power would experience difficulty in armed conflict against a comparatively sized Eyomic power.</p>
<p>The state of Eyomic military powers is presently stable, with no faction having any significant tactical edge on any other power and all powers having functional equivalents to one another's forces. This state is new, having become true within the last few decades. Many predict a break to the equilibrium will occur within the next 20 years.</p>
<p>All of Eyom's militaries are modernized Technoarcana using combined arms armies consisting of Infantry, Armored Calvary, Air Forces, Construct Divisions, and Arcane Forces. The astute will note naval ships are missing from this list. Eyom's militaries do not make use of the water, and do not need to do so due to their air forces.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Infantry</h4>
<p>Eyomic Infantry consists of two primary groups, <a href="../gamerules/ArmyRegular.html">Regular Infantry</a> and <a href="../gamerules/Militiaman.html">Reserve Infantry</a> (aka militias).</p>
<p>The Regulars are 60% generalist troops, with the remaining 40% split into specialized roles. These roles are supportive in nature, serving to back up the regular troops with medical care, fire support, defense, sapping, and covering fire. Eyom's Regulars are well-trained at fighting other armed humanoids and well-equipped for war. Each soldier receives a specialized enchanted weapon that is magically bound to their very souls.</p>
<p>The Reserves consist of all members of village militias, which typically serve as town guards and still exist within Eyom due to the vast, untamed wildernesses. Reservists are typically poorly equipped and under trained for warfare but come in great numbers and are uniquely qualified for operations against monstrous creatures. Interestingly, a common arm among militiamen of all Eyomic nations is the entrenching tool, which they often use as an improvised ax.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Armored Calvery</h4>
<p>As with all modern armies, Eyom has largely replaced its animal mounted warriors with vehicle operators. Eyoms armies make use of battle tanks, scout vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and infantry transport vehicles. While each nation ahs their own designs and specilized vehicles, all currently known vehicles fall into one of those four rolls.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Air Forces</h4>
<p>Eyom's militaries make use of significant air-based units. Heavier-than-air aircraft exist but are slow and clumsy. This is not due to technological insufficiency or arcane ignorance but due to Eyom having embraced lighter-than-air aircraft far more than the rest of Zo. Eyom's militaries make use of air fortresses, regiment transport zeppelins, artillery platforms, and cloud bases, all of which are substantially large rigid airship-based aircraft, some of which are comparable in size to a castle.</p>
<p>Heavier than air aircraft are primarily a civilian endeavor but do serve military roles as messengers and scouting forces due to their greater speed. They have yet to catch on with Eyomic militaries as attack units due to the impressive armor of their lighter-than-air vessels.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Construct Divisions</h4>
<p>Construct Divisions are unique to Eyom, and would be classified as Armored Calvery by other world powers. The functional difference is Construct Vehicles make use of locomotion via legs rather than wheels, treads, or levitation. These forms of combat are well known to all, though Eyom counts them separately as they are the realm of knights, which have continued to exist as elite warriors into the modern days of Eyom as they were early adopters of powered armor.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Arcane Forces</h4>
<p>Eyom's armed forces make use of the standard array of arcane soldiers. They make use of battle mages, combat clerics, war diviners, and earth shapers to the same extent as other world powers.</p>
<p>The major difference between Eyom and the rest of Zo is their greater production of magic items. Eyom's elites can all be counted as Arcane Forces by other nations' standards, even if Eyom itself doesn't count them as such. This is not due to spellcasting, necessarily, but rather the sheer bulk of arcane equipment their elites make use of in their day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Combined with <a href="../misc/Magic.html">War Totems</a> enabling any number of troops to cast basic spells cheaply and effectively, and strictly speaking, all Eyomic soldiers are battlemages. Only expense in coin and time prevents this from being the case.</p>

	<p>The word artifact has many meanings. The one we use within this article is that of a magical object crafted through means lost to time. The majority of these are Zoman in origin, though some are the product of modern peoples while others are older than even the Zoman. While not all artifacts are powerful, the ones we will discuss below certainly are.</p>
	<p>There are two forms of artifacts, Unique and Common. Unique artifacts are just that, a unique object of magical power with nothing else quite like it in all of Zo. Common artifacts either have similar / equivalent items, enough to form a family, or there is at least one flawless copy of the artifact in question.</p>

<h5 class="articletitle" id="TimeBench">The Bench of Time</h5>
	<p>The Bench of Time is a large backless stone park bench, carved from black marble and decorated with silver embellishments relating to the passage of time. This includes the moon in different phases, illustrations of a zodiac with different figures acing north, and plants in different seasonal phases. The top of the bench sits three medium creatures, or one large creature, and is decorated with a runic carving describing an arcane ritual in a long lost language.</p>
	<p>Sitting on the Bench grants the user the ability to either stop or travel through time. It's time travel is limited in that a person can never go back further in time than when they first sat on the Bench. Rather they are able to return to that specific point in time for a certain time after they used the Bench's power.</p>
	<p>The Bench is presently located within the Warrenese capital <a href="../towns/ChyûchûRûyu̽Mudâ.html">Chyûchû Rûyu̽ Mudâ</a>, specifically within the throne room of the Holy Emperor's Palace and serves as the throne of the Holy Emperor themself.</p>

		<p class="sectionhead">STATISTICS</p>
		<p><b>Alignment</b> TN;</p>
		<p class="sectionhead">POWERS:</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 5%;">Anyone who sits on the Bench of Time immediately becomes aware of its properties, powers, and capabilities as the Bench teaches all who interact with it everything it can do for them. This process is instantaneous. THe Bench can permit anyone to do as follows:</p>
		<ol>
	  	  <li>Anyone sitting on the bench is able to stop the passage of time for everyone save themselves. Should they remain on the bench, they are able to extend the duration of the time stop as long as they please. The Bench does not stop time for its user, making it possible to starve, dehydrate, age, and die while keeping time frozen in this manner. Sleeping on the bench after activating this ability will not activate its other abilities. If the user leaves the bench after activating this ability, time remains frozen for exactly 24 hours to the moment the power was activated.</li>
	  	  <ol>
	  		  <li>This power can be shared by up to 3 people, as the bench seats three. If any of the users get up from the bench, the 24 hour countdown begins for all users.</li>
	  	  </ol>
	  	  <li>Anyone who sleeps on the bench becomes attuned to the moment they wake from their sleep (even sleeping for a moment permits this effect). Once attuned they can leave the bench, and should they die within a year and a day from the moment they awoke, they will revert to the moment they first awoke on the bench after attunement.</li>
	  	  <ol>
	  		  <li>This ability can be triggered at any time an attuned user wishes.</li>
	  		  <li>Recalls are self-correcting for time paradoxes. A user will be returned to the moment in time they attuned to the bench, appearing on the Bench at the exact moment of their first awakening. Should the bench have been moved, they appear where the bench is in the present. Any changes made to the world by other instances of time travel will affect the user as well. For example, if they attuned in a red shirt, and some other instance of time travel means they would have worn a blue shirt in the new time line, they will recall into a blue shirt. The user's memories are protected from temporal editing, as is their life but all other elements of their existence can be edited by other uses of time travel.</li>
	  		  <li>Attuning to the bench prevents attuned individuals from being erased from time for the duration of their attunement.</li>
	  	  </ol>
	  	  <li>It is possible to sacrifice one's first born child atop the bench before attuning. This is accomplished via the use of a chronomantic spell inscribed on the bench's seat. Doing so appears to send the child to an unknown extraplanar location somewhen in time, from whence the child will not return. In exchange for the sacrifice, the parents of the child will be permanently attuned to the Bench, and can recall to any point in time they please from the sacrifice to the moment of their death.</li>
	  	  <ol>
	  		  <li>Any instance of unnatural death will automatically recall the user to the beginning of the day they died.</li>
	  		  <li>Death by age and disease will cause the attunement to expire, preventing the user from recalling from these fates.</li>
	  		  <li>The Bench does not care if the user attunes in this fashion then obtains any form of immortality, including undeath. It will allow them to continue recalling at will until they reach a natural death as counted by the Bench. The user can even use this to experiment with different means of immortality, then return to a point before they obtained it to choose another method if they wish.</li>
	  	  </ol>
		</ol>
		<p class="sectionhead">DESTRUCTION</p>
		<p>The Bench of Time is unidirectionaly fixed in time. While it can influence the world, the world cannot influence it. It is thus truly indestructible. Attuned users can be killed by casting Time Stop, followed by Mages Disjunction with a spellcraft check of 30 to remove the attunement. At which point, they can be killed by any conventional means.</p>
		<p>There is no means of identifying an attuned user directly. Indirect means, such as independent time travel, interviews, and old school detective work are the only ways one can find any attuned user.</p>

<h5 class="articletitle" id="Wayfinder">Wayfinder</h5>
<p>Wayfinder is a living map which can never be held onto for long. Eventually, Wayfinder will say goodbye, and depart from its current owner via impossible to interdict teleportation, and appear in a location where it will be swiftly found by any adventurous soul. Wayfinder takes the form of a simple hand mirror with a medium orange stained wood base, and appears entirely unadorned. The most elegant and fancy feature present on Wayfinder is their glass "face" which is entirely free of defects and perfectly flat.</p>
<p>Wayfinder appears within the mirror as a crude drawing of a face with two dots for eyes and a simple mouth. When Wayfinder speaks, it is with the voice of a young teenage girl, though Wayfinder objects very strongly to being called "she" and will demand to be called "they". Failing to do so will cause Wayfinder to immediately leave via teleportation. While Wayfinder can make various expressions and appear to look at its surroundings, it always has the appearance of a crude child's doodling, save that it is composed of a pleasant pink light. Wayfinder's face can be replaced at any time with a prefect map of Zo.</p>
<p>This map is so precise and accurate that it cannot be displayed in its entirety. Instead, Wayfinder's owner must touch the glass face and use various gestures to magnify, demagnify, and move the map's view. Wayfinder can preform this task themselves if they are asked to. Wayfinder's most valuable service is their unerringly prefect navigation, able to take the user from anywhere they happen to be to anywhere they wish to go and know the name of, provided there is a traversable route.</p>
<p>Wayfinder generally leaves their owner behind after remaining by their side through a truly epic adventure before leaving to "Share the fun." Wayfinder is known to occasionally seek out those it has served before and views as a "friend" for "One more adventure!"</p>

   	 <p class="sectionhead">POWERS:</p>
   	 <p>Anyone who locates Wayfinder while exploring a place on their own or with no more than 4 other friends is able to make use of Wayfinder to obtain the following information at will:</p>
   	 <ol>
     	   <li>A prefect map of any given area the user knows the location or name of. This can be of either large scale places like a nation or a city, or small scale places such as a room.</li>
     	   <ol>
     		   <li>While Wayfinder can show the general shape of things at the scale of individual rooms, Wayfinder cannot provide more detail unless brought into the room in question. At which point, an exact image of the room as it was at that moment will replace any vague guesses Wayfinder had made prior.</li>
     	   </ol>
     	   <li>The best possible directions to get from any point to any point the user can verbally name, or physically tap on Wayfinder's face.</li>
     	   <li>The location of all businesses within any given settlement. If Wayfinder deems their current user a friend, they can also view:</li>
   			 <ol>
   				 <li>The buisness's hours of operation.</li>
   				 <li>The buisness's busiest hours.</li>
   				 <li>How much more expensive the business is compared to others of its kind in the same settlement.</li>
   			 </ol>
     	   <li>Real time assistance in locating routes to take to avoid pursuers.</li>
   			 <li>Real time "hot spots of adventure" which take the form of map markers indicating the deaths of any relatively well known adventuring parties, as well as what killed them, what they were doing, and who asked them to do it.</li>
   	 </ol>
   	 <p>Wayfinder is an intelligent magical item with the general disposition of a young teenage girl who self reports as someone who "goes surfing in space, and makes really good Fondue." and other such fantastical nonsense followed by mundane trivialities when asked anything about themself. Observation indicates Wayfinder to be an incredibly (often obnoxiously) cheerful individual who if they had a body would be striding across each and every last frontier in search of new life and new civilizations. Boldly going where none have gone before, only to then take a vacation to the most populated place in all of Zo to locate the best restaurant in the city with the same level of wonder and excitement.</p>
   	 <p>Should Wayfinder encounter a similarly minded individual, they will declare this person to be their friend. A friend gains access to the following abilities:</p>
   	 <ol>
   		 <li>Wayfinder will happily reproduce anything they have seen in the form of an illustration on her face, either as a still or moving image (complete with sound).</li>
   		 <li>Wayfinder will happily provide assistance with any quest specific puzzles, riddles, or other challenges that can be solved by knowledge.</li>
   		 <li>Wayfinder can serve as an Aethiary accessible device, even if there is no nearby aethiary link.</li>
   		 <li>Wayfinder can, seemingly at will but not all the time, manifest a body around their mirror which takes the form of a somewhat blocky short human female of indeterminate age. This body is composed of bright pink glowing triangles, with two blue triangles for her eyes. The body shares the same physical attributes as their current owner, and can preform any task they can (IE, Wayfinder is able to duplicate their current owner's abilities in full). Wayfinder seems reluctant to do this, and will usually only do so to protect their friends, share in a special moment, or to offer a hug if her friend is feeling blue. Wayfinder responds to romantic advances like a 9 year old girl, finding such things inherently gross, but also kind of funny.</li>
   		 <li>Wayfinder can, should a friend die, teleport their remains to their family for burial.</li>
   	 </ol>
		 <p>Wayfinder will do their best to stear people twards the Chaotic Good alignment. They are not judgmental, nor disapproving, but will attempt to persuade, debate, and moralize with people. This has no bearings on wether or not Wayfinder will be friends with somone. Wayfinder will happily serve anyone whose heart also longs for an adventure. Its simply that Wayfinder truly believes that being generaly aultruistic and kind while judging each situation on its own by its own merits is the best way to live and wants the best for their fellow adventurers.</p>
   	 <p class="sectionhead">DESTRUCTION</p>
   	 <p>Wayfinder appears to be functionally indestructible. The mirror Wayfinder calls home can be smashed with a DC 25 strength check. Doing so causes the entity within the mirror to simply take over the next closest mirror which is reasonably portable. However, should Wayfinder manifest an avatar, and the avatar is destroyed, Wayfinder's mirror will shatter and a new instance of Wayfinder has never been located within 10 years of such an instance occuring. That said, Wayfinder always returns, as happy and bubbly as ever, despite remembering being killed and the associated pain and suffering.</p>
		 <p>Wayfinder has said on several occasions that they would "die for good" if the world itself stopped being intresting.</p>

<p>This page contains a simple generator which will detail a cult for you. Simply press the button to get new details. You cannot adjust individual paramiters, this is intended to be more of a prompt generator than a system to create a finished product.</p>
<p>Type a name into the Name of Cult field to give your cult a specific name. If the cult's name begins with the word "the", omit it as the generator automaticaly adds the word "the" to the cult's name where appropriate. If you do not have an intended name for the cult, simply type "cult" into the field if it has not automaticaly done so for you.</p>
<p>The scratch pad at the bottem of the page stores text localy on your device via a cookie, and will persist through closing the tabs, opening and closing the browser, and even system reboots. You should, howeaver, backup anything stored there as your device may clear cookies automaticaly.

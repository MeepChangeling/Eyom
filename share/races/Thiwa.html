<article>
<p>Thiwa are a species of humanoids native to the Dungeon Strata, a labyrinthine series of interconnected bunkers, shelters, cities, laboratories, and other vestiges of civilization created deep underground by the ancient <a href="../cultures/ancient.html">Z̚oman</a>.</p>
<p>The people of Eyom know of the Thiwa primarily through myths spread by adventurers and would recognize them (or at least their mythical conceptions of them) by the name Strata Runners. The Thiwa also call themselves Ruukwo Akwi, or Akwi. These are interchangeable with Thiwa. Thiwa itself translates to "person" in their language, and the Thiwa do not put cultural importance on race or species. Likewise, Akwi is their word for rat, with Ruukwo Akwi meaning "lab rat".</p>
<p>Their origins may have just become clear to many of you, but rest assured there is nuance and detail their chosen name leaves out.</p>
<p>The Thiwa come from a place they call Gebgep, a large Zoman facility yet explored by anyone aside from the Thiwa. Little is known of the facility other than it is located beneath <a href="../regions/PillowwaterWoods.html">Pillowwater Woods</a> roughly at the coordinates <a href="../maps/regionmap.html#22.23254,-30.89149,11z">22°N 30°W</a> at a depth as of yet unreached by the Dwarves.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Gebgep is not a Thiwan word. It is in fact an acronym made up of Zoman words. While their meaning is lost, the words themselves are still known to the Thiwa and phonetically transcribed as follows: Gejido Batopagepa ja Gediro Poto.</p>
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="quotebox">
    <p>"Pardon me, sir. Is it true that Tanuki can understand some Zoman when spoken?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, but less than people think. Mostly simple directions and commands. Why?"</p>
    <p>"Would you be kind enough to attempt to translate a Zoman phrase for me?"</p>
    <p>"Sure."</p>
    <p>"Thank you. Ah-em. Gejido Batopagepa ja Gediro Poto."</p>
    <p>"Oh, wow... That's very strongly accented. I think the second word is... School? No. Workshop?"</p>
    <p>"University? Institute?"</p>
    <p>"Something like that. No idea about the rest."</p>
    <p>"Thank you for the help."</p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">- Sir Primrose interviewing a passing Tanuki</p>
</div>
<p>The Thiwa are largely xenophobic, not in the racist scene but rather literally. As in they are irrationally frightened of other intelligent life forms. While this is not universally true (They seem to feel comfortable around Imperials and Jive Elves.) and many of their people are happy to work alongside "Overlanders", the majority of the Thiwa prefer to remain in the shadows. They have a long history of conflict with the Dwarves and are likely the source of the Dwarves ancient (and currently past) animosity towards the Rattu given the Rattu and Thiwa are both beastfolk based on rats.</p>
<p>The Thiwa's general mythos as the "Strata Runners" is one of dangerous lurkers in the dark who will attack on site but rarely kill. They are mostly feared by the Eyom's citizens, yet the accounts of their people are so few (or so culturally biased) that accurate information, including their appearance, is hard to come by.</p>
<p>This article, while shallow, has been confirmed as accurate by multiple sources. Both Thiwan and Eyomic.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Personality</em></strong></h4>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Thiwa are xenophobic in the most literal sense. This stems from an ancient war against the Dwarves, which the Dwarves themselves mostly call as a war against aberrations in general. The Thiwa remember the event as the invasion of their home territory, one which they largely lost and began an exodus of their people to the corners of the world.</p>
<p>With that as the formative event in their modern culture, it's hardly surprising that most of their people are paranoid about being found by other peoples of the world. Combined with their habitation of the Dungeon Strata and general biology making them most suited to dark or even lightless environments and it's little wonder why they have remained largely undiscovered and entirely uncontacted until the present day.</p>
<p>Even then, the contact is relatively small and limited. Not to say individual Thiwa do not occasionally journey to the surface in search of adventure, but when they do they typically do so in the guize of a Rattu. This disguise is rather easy for them to assume, given their similar body shapes and the Rattu's cultural inclination to wear hooded robes.</p>
<p>When within their own territory, the Thiwa remain in darkness where they are at no disadvantage due to their sight being their secondary rather than primary sense. Consequently, they are often mistaken for Rattu, or aberrations if encountered within the Dungeon Strata. They will play up these misconceptions, using disguises, masks, outfits, and occasionally spells to ensure they are almost never seen for what they are.</p>
<p>This behavior is of course derived from losing their homeland. The Thiwa have a ddeep-seated loathing of the locations of their settlements becoming known, and will use any means necessary to prevent even a single hermit's refuge from being known as what it is. Deception, misdirection, concealment, and violence are all permissible to maintain stealth and obscurity.</p>
<p>This is not to say the Thiwa are inherently violent. When encountered well away from their residences, they are naturally curious and somewhat friendly. Cultural teachings prevent them from trading with Eyom's peoples, but they frequently assist people within the Dungeon Strata in small ways. Often unseen.</p>
<div class="quotebox">
    <p>"How can someone know if your people have aided them?"</p>
    <p>"When a door once shut is open without explanation. When your cantine is dry, and you begin to hear water running through a pipe. When a strange sound awakens you before the Lurkers in the Dark pounce. Then you know."</p>
    <p>"You can't be responsible for all of those things."</p>
    <p>"No, but many."</p>
</div>
<p>Inturnaly and individually. Thiwa are a naturally intellectual species, as befits their native environment. As they are constantly surrounded by technology, they see machinery as natural. Likewise, as they must take special care to grow their food, they see plant life as artificial. This inversion of the usual norm leads to a people much like the Iron Elves, as the Thiwa lovingly attend to arrays of cogs and pipes much like you might care for a family pet.</p>
<p>Unlike the Iron Elves, the Thiwa are not obsessive progress seekers or techno-perfectionists. Instead, they are naturally analytical, detail-oriented, and organized. They are exceptionally skeptical (but respectful), impressively objective, and great collaborators.</p>
<p><i>(<b>Explorer's Note:</b> That heavy breathing you can hear in the distance is the Council of Scientists. Pay them no mind.)</i></p>
<p>For those not scientifically inclined, the majority of Thiwa make for natural scientists. The general qualities and dispositions of their average individual are perfectly suited for learning through observation, measurement, hypothesizing, testing, and refining based on the results of the aforementioned testing. The very scientific process is instinctive to the Thiwa, and they will preform experiments as a matter of daily background tasks, similar to how you might peal apples to make a stew, or idly dust a shelf.</p>
<p>This is not indicative of individual personalities as a whole, the entire process is background and nearly subconscious for the Thiwa. They are also quite physically active, enjoying walks, exploration in general, working out (particularly weigh tlifting), and puzzle solving. They are particularly adept at navigation puzzles, and delight in a good challenge, such as solving a labyrinth or pathfinding across hostile terrain under certain restrictions.</p>
<p>These proclivities have allowed them to unlock the secrets of many Zoman technologies. Fortunately for Eyom's citizens, these are Ancient Zoman secrets, when the lost Empire's technology was still rooted in the physical materials and properties therin of said technology's physical components. The main consequence of the technological edge for the Thiwa is a communications network similar to the Aethiary, but much older.</p>
<p>The existence of the Kamenï Web has removed the Thiwa's sense of distance. They do not experience loneliness provided they have regular access to the "Shadow Web", and feel the full effects of socializing through text, illusory, audio-only, and other means of remote communication and activities. This ability is used to its fullest effect, allowing their nation to be very widespread and exist in tiny cells without loosing any of what makes a nation a cohesive whole.</p>
<p>It also has created a monoculture, with little room for alternative points of view due to the scientific inclinations of its members. There are pockets of alternate lifestyles and views, but these are typically monastic orders with open declarations of their values lying within a specific say of living. These compounds are largely accepted and supported, if thought of as a little silly.</p>
<p>For the average Thiwa, life is about discovery, innovation, and prosperity in the shadows.</p>
<p>We would be remiss if we did not mention a near-universal psychological phenomenon found within the Thiwan mind. When a group of Thiwa (or others who are emotional close to a number of Thiwa) are under threat violence, death, or otherwise put at imminent risk by a compatible force, the Thiwa are incapable of resolving the situation peacefully, and will whip themselves into a raging frenzy.</p>
<p>This is biological in nature, and thus deeply rooted in culture and tradition. The thing to look for is any individual starting the Thiwan Warcry. This is a guttural intonation of the phrase "jiuti shi kwewï" (Translation: Mechanical Engineering / Physics). The cry begins as a chant, building to a roar, and often ending in a frothing frenzy for all individual participating individuals.</p>
<p>This behavior effects groups, not individuals, and appears to be a culturally reinforced survival instinct. It cannot be supprised once it begins and only ends with the death of the threat or the group. Those distressed by this knowledge should be aware it's generally only evoked when first blood is spilled. Until that point, Thiwa are more than happy to talk problems out. It's only after the tipping point that surrender, mercy, property damage, and survival instinct are discarded.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Physical Description</em></strong></h4>
<p>Thiwa are a complex species. While they are encapsulated with the phrase "rat-descended beastfolk", they possess many unique features very much unlike that of rats, the details of their forms are quite alien.</p>
<p>Their basic description is a humanot which stands on two digitigrade legs ending in dainty paws tipped with small claws, that maintain their balance in part with a long sinuous tail. Their tails and bodies re covered with a silky fur which while soft in one direction is very "poky" when stroked against the grain. Their proportions and body shape are remarkably human, albit their legs are notably slender from the knee down, and well muscled form the knee up.</p>
<p>The over all body proportions along with the tufted tail tip suggest ancestry from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_kangaroo_rat">Dipodomys deserti</a>. Slender upper body, powerful upper leg muscles, general humanoid shape common to all beastfolk.</p>
<p>Their fur comes in blacks, grays, and browns, and is typically found as a two-tone coat. They have hair much like a humans in terms of location and length, though their hair grows in spiky segments without exception. Their hair comes in many cooler colors such as teal, blue, gray, and green.</p>
<p>That's the end of conventional biology as far as the Thiwa are concerned.</p>
<p>Thiwa have six ears arranged with a large pair nearly the size of their forearms at the upper mos position, followed by two sets of progressive slammer ears running parallel to one another. These clusters of ears are rat-like in shape, and can move either together or independently. They often look like a single pair of massive ears with some damage (specifically notches) at the outer edge. However, when desired, a Thiwa can position each ear to pinpoint the source of a particular sound, or to receive a full view of their environment in a bubble in a fashion similar to echo-location, though far more precise.</p>
<p>Thiwa use their sense of hearing as their primary sense. They are able to distinguish distance, shape, and even texture by almost any disturbance in the air including such small disturbances as a creature's respiration, and the general flow of the air itself. Unlike what one would expect, they are not disturbed, distressed, or harmed by loud noises. Their hearing is quite fortified, as they do not find gunfire occurring near their head to be uncomfortable (In terms of the sound. They assridly do not like the existence of fast moving projectiles near their craniums.)</p>
<p>Thiwa have six eyes. All six eyes are a gemstone-like shad of red. Eye color does not verry at all between individuals. Their two main eyes are located where one would expect a beastfolk's eyes to be, and somewhat large, but not overly so. Their secondary eyes are much smaller, no bigger than a pebble, and located towards the center of their face at a diagonal angle upwards and downwards from their main eyes. The secondary eyes appear to be small decorative jewls to many peoples.</p>
<p>Their eyes are hard, covered by a thick protective lens composed of organic resin which heals over time. Thiwa do not blink, but do have eyelids and can close their eyes (which they do inorder to sleep or clean their eyes). Their eyes see a limited range of color, skewed heavily towards the red end of the spectrum as their eyes are absorbing thermal radiation far more than visible light.</p>
<p>It is best not to think of the Thiwa as seeing heat, but to realize they see an entirely different sort of light than you or I. They find sunlight blinding and painful, as to them, your very body is a glowing coal. Fire has a similar pain-response, as a simple camp fire to them appears as a welding torch does to us. Consequently, almost all Thiwa wear goggles or masks to shield their eyes on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Thiwa possess other insectoid traits aside from their eye coverings. Most are internal, including a hydraulic system built into their musculature which works in tandem with conventional mammalian biology, small bioluminescent patches (the color of which is controlled by the individual and can be any hue, though generally appear red or unilluminated to the eyes of other species) certain reproductive features, and most notably a set of near-vestigial grasping claws on their abdomens.</p>
<p>The four claws are simple spike-like appendages attached to the sternum with two joints, one at the sternum and one at the end of a short "arm". The claws are chitinous but contain mammalian bone for added strength. They are extremely durable, resilient, and regenerative. The claws can be held in a ready stance, moved independently, or folded neatly away along the chest and sided just under the individual's last set of ribs.</p>
<p>The Thiwa primarily use them to hold small objects on their person, much like a hook on a belt. The claws are also useful in holding prey or an opponent should the Thiwa elect to grapple. Surprisingly, they are not used in mating.</p>
<p>Thiwa have some interesting internal anatomy. Notably, their kidneys are extremely efficient at removing waste from the body without wasting water. Consequently, their liquid waste is 80% ammonia and most of the water they drink is recycled within their kidneys and returned to their body's various systems for reuse. This allows a Thiwa to survive on less than a mouthful of water a day with no ill consequences. It also makes them quite vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication">water intoxication</a>. A Thiwa will begin to feel the primary effects of water intoxication after an intake greater than 0.5L per hour and will die if they consume more than 0.54L per hour.</p>
<p>Their aforementioned insectoid abilities come into play with their vascular system. Thiwa have multiple hearts, two in the torso of equal size to a typical mammalian species of their height (~2.05 m), a third smaller heart located in their pelvis behind a chitinous armored plate, and a fourth minuscule heart within their skulls dedicated expressly to circulating and purifying blood within their brains. They can survive with any one of their hearts damaged, and even function with most of their physical capabilities for several hours in such a state. If both primary hearts are damaged, the secondary hearts are just sufficient enough to keep the Thiwa alive and conscious.</p>
<p>Their blood is halfway between hemolymph and typical mammalian blood and clots with exceptional swiftness. Legends relating to their people suggested they possessed a form of regeneration, like trolls or gnolls. Alas, no. It's simply that a sword through their stomach will make them bleed for a few minutes before the wound seals itself. The Thiwa have little need for bandages, though can still die of blood loss. Such a fate is quite rare and usually involves internal bleeding. A Thiwa is much more likely to die from physical trauma before they succumb to blood loss.</p>
<p><b>WARNING!</b> Under no circumstance accept a transfusion from a Thiwa. They will readily offer them to anyone bleeding to death as they understand the medical concept but do not have multiple blood types. Hence, all Thiwa can accept a transfusion from any other Thiwa. Even if they understood a transfusion can only occur between compatible individuals, their blood will kill you, as it contains substantial amounts of sulfur and mercury. This warning is surprisingly necessary in spite of Thiwa blood being a vivid blue color rather than red due to these chemicals.</p>
<p>All Thiwa are female. They reproduce via parthenogenesis, though in their case children are not necessarily clones of their mother (though many are). Thiwa have chromosome triplets where each triplet is paired with its copy rather than its counterparts. This reproductive method enables them to have genetic diversity previously thought to have been unique to sexually reproductive species. Fertilization occurs by individual will as a conscious process, though it can be subconsciously activated in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>This process is compounded by their general behavior relating to mating. Unlike most asexual species, Thiwa do mate. Their primary sex hormone is progesterone, and depending on their current level (which naturally fluctuates in a yearly cycle), they will engage in masculine or feminine reproductive behaviors. Interestingly, the cycles of life partners synchronize at opposite points, effectively ensuring one always has the opposite desire of their partner.</p>
<p>Like much of their biology, Thiwa's reproductive anatomy is partially insectoid. While they only carry 1-3 children at a time (usually 1, rarely 2, seldom 3), Thiwa do not carry their children to term. While they possess the required anatomy to do so, they ley their children as eggs via an ovipositor in a manner similar to many wasps. IE; they typically leave their eggs in a warm dark place with ready access to moisture.</p>
<p>A Thiwa can carry another's eggs if they choose. In such cases, her body will accept the eggs and similarly nurture them as in mammalian pregnancy. The eggs will be discharged slightly before the embryos hatch.</p>
<p>While the Thiwa do not have life stages in the same way insects do (ie larva, nymph, adult) young Thiwa are very small, standing only 20cm high on average. They grow to their full size slowly, reaching it in 22 years, with most of the growth occurring after the age of 16 (before which they are generally around 40 cm in height.)</p>
<p>Thiwa often carry their children in a backpack due to their size greatly hampering their speed.</p>
<p>Lastly, due to their inability to grow large volumes of crops, Thiwa do not make clothing for any reason other than practical utility. As they do not need shoes, and can use their graspers as belts, and are kept warm by their fur, most Thiwa are nudists. They do, however, wear and make use of armor, which they adore, and even wear casually.</p>
<p>Given access to abundant fabric resources, most Thiwa prefer loose flowy garments, which can be easily discarded if mobility is needed or form-fitting protective garments with absurd numbers of pockets.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Relations</em></strong></h4>
<p>Thiwa have almost no relationship with any of Eyom's peoples, and that's how they prefer it.</p>
<p>In recent times, post contact by Imperial Explorers, the Thiwa elected to reveal their civilizations' existence, but not location to the world at large. Rather than to open trade, this was to lay formal claim to the mid-level of the dungeon strata, and certain specific locations within other parts of it, as their territory, home, and in all ways theirs. It was also intended to secure protections and rights for any of their individuals who wished to explore, live, or work on the surface.</p>
<p>While most nations agreed to respect their claims to the Dungeon Strata (as their territory is typically too deep for anyone else to access safely), many Gnolish city-states, the Guild of Engineers, and the Federation of Alvaria do not accept the Thiwa territorial claims. The exception being their home facility and Kentia Isle (which the Thiwa find sacred).</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Undermountain refuses to acknowledge their home facility as being the Thiwa's, citing the rules of conquest.</p>
<p>The Thiwa have little other relations with Eyom's peoples. However, there exists a certain kinship between Imperial Humans, Jive Elves, and the Thiwa which appears to be biological in nature. Likely a Zoman-designed instinct intended to ensure their creations got along with one another. The effect of this instinct is neither of these three groups sees the other's appearance or general behavior as strange or worrisome and has a vague understanding of the other two's body language combined with a vague notion that they are friendly. This induces a relaxed state in terms of general interactions. For whatever reason, this instinct is not present in Eyom's other races.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Settlements</em></strong></h4>
<figure style="width: 25%;" class="left">
<figcaption class="basic"><b>A Thiwan glyph of warning.</b></figcaption>
<img style="width:100%" src="..\img\races\ThiwaWarning.png" alt="A Thiwan glyph of warning." title="A Thiwan glyph of warning." />
</figure>
<p>The Thiwa refuse to provide any documentable detail on their settlements locations or general layout. They have limited information to the following:</p>
<p>Their settlements always make use of locally available Zoman facilities, which they repair as best they can. Their settlements are bastions of technology and safety within the Dungeon Strata and should not be assaulted, assailed, or attacked in any way by any force unwilling to incur extreme or even total losses.</p>
<p>They have marked tunnels leading to their settlements. The markings consist of the following image.</p>
<p>The glyph will glow a dull red, bright enough to be seen clearly by anyone, but not so bright it would blind or annoy the Thiwa themselves. The glyph, if seen, will be located within 100 paces of a settled area. If seen, individuals are to turn away. Rest assured you have already been observed, and continuing past the marking is to be done at one's own risk.</p>
<p>It is possible for one to gain entrance to the settlement, but binding oaths and spells will be used to prevent you from revealing the location to anyone should you be allowed entry.</p>
<p>It is likely the glyph itself carries an enchantment preventing the intentional mention of a settlment's location, but this has yet to be verified as while the glyph was provided in simple pen and ink form for this article, it has never been seen in the field.</p>
<p>Aside that is, from Sir Primrose. Who has visited multiple Thiwa settlements unmolested, and reported she wouldn't betray their trust even so much as to say if she'd been enchanted or not in regards to locating their settlements. Given she is the primary contact point between the Empire and the Thiwa, she will not be pressed on this issue.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Alignment</em></strong></h4>
<p>Thiwa are a very honor-driven people. This stems from their general rationality and objectiveness. They use statistics on the past behavior of individuals to judge how they are likely to act in the future and treat them accordingly. While all peoples do this, the Thiwa empathize it greatly and have an underlying sense of the mathematics and statistics involved. This makes their predictions accurate. Hence, they do not have large bodies of laws detailing circumstances or variations of other laws. They make use of simple rules and use the circumstances of each situation to judge whether the application of the rule is just in the given scenario. If a rule is just, it is applied. If it is not just, a just one-off ruling is created for the specific circumstance.</p>
<p>Many humans find this process very irritating, as it is nearly impossible to game.</p>
<p>Thiwa are extremely communal and seek to help others as much as themselves. They are driven by greed and altruism in equal measure. Oddly there is little overlap. They do not seek wealth to have the power or glory of being the source of their community's wealth. Their wealth is for them. At the same time, the same individual will wish to improve the general wealth of their community due to the simple truth that the more wealthy someone is, the more they can spend. Thus, in the Thiwa's eyes, increasing the wealth of the group is the most efficient way to increase individual wealth through creating more and better sources of wealth within a community.</p>
<p>Gnolls like this mentality so much they are amongst the most accepting of Thiwa for this reason alone.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Adventurers</em></strong></h4>
<p>Thiwa are adventurers born. It's just that few wish to brave the blinding heat of the sun to see what the suffice is like. They can most commonly be found underground, but as time goes on, more nad more wish to explore the surface and see the "synthetic world" as they put it. As previously mentioned, the Thiwa see nature as artificial due to the limits of their cultivation. They believe surfers to be unbelievably wealthy due to the plantlife, and thus, many see our world as a land of opportunity to make bank.</p>
<p>Many Thiwa have seen photographs of Imperials and Jive elves, and specifically seek them out due to aesthetic appreciation and a desire to learn of their cultures.</p>
<p>Another more significant group adventure for a sacred to their culture reason encapsulated in their saying "Ukwo jiï shentï ma shi ntuni." Which when translated without the expletive means "To learn everything".</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Racial Traits</em></strong></h4>
<div id="StandardRacialTraits">
<h3>Standard Racial Traits</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">
<p class="traitTypeHeader"><strong>Ability Score Racial Traits:</strong> <span id="AbilityScoreRacialTraits">Thiwa gain +2 Str and +2 Int.<br /></span><strong>Type:</strong> <span id="CreatureType">Thiwa are Monstrous Humanoids.<br /></span><strong>Size:</strong> <span id="RaceSize">Thiwa are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.<br /></span><strong>Speed:</strong> <span id="RaceSpeed">Thiwa have a base speed of 30 feet. They also have a climb speed of 30 feet, which also grants them a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. Their climbing is magical in nature, and works on any solid surface, but not within areas where arcane spells are suppressed, nor if they have more than 15% spell failure from equipment or carry a heavy load. Lastly, Thiwa are always considered to have a running start when making Acrobatics checks to jump (no matter how encumbered).<br /></span><strong>Languages:</strong> <span id="Languages">Thiwa begin play speaking Xor&iuml;moian and Common.<br /></span><strong>Strata Native:</strong> Thiwa have a +2 racial bonus on Stealth checks. The bonus on Stealth checks increases to a +4 bonus while underground. Additionally, Thiwa reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving at full speed by 5, and reduce the Stealth check penalty for sniping by 10.<br /><strong>Spell-like ability:</strong> Thiwa can extend their arcane aura to a small number of others to grant them the ability to climb (Normaly this is used to aid their children). They can cast <em>communal spider climb</em> once per meal as a spell-like ability, with a maximum of Con times per day (minimum 1). The caster level for this ability equals the Thiwa's class level.<br /><strong>Natural Scientist: </strong>Thiwa are natural scientists. They gain two knowledge skills of their choice at character creation to treat as class skills. Once a day, they may reroll a single check from either of these skills and take the better result.<br /><strong>Tech Adept:</strong> Thiwa gain a +2 bonus on any skill check relating to technology. They can also use, maintain, and repair any weapon with Zoman or Thiwa in their name. Lastly, they start play with either a Thiwan Sonic Spear, or Thiwan Beam Sword.</p>
<div style=”margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;>
	<p><i>Thiwan Sonic Spear:</i> A +2 mastwork Shortspear which vibrates at ultrasonic frequencies, allowing it to burrow through hard surfaces with ease. +5 to sunder attempts, and +2d4 damage if used as a melee weapon rather than thrown. Made entirely from steel and aluminum, very light and agile, with good throwing range due to its hollow shaft… and thus cannot be used effectively for defense -2 to AC vs melee attacks.</p>
<p><i>Thiwan Beam Sword:</i> A +2 masterwork shortsword with a blade composed of magnetically confined particulates moving within an electrical arc at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light. Functions much like a sword, but cuts slower, working more like a chainsaw than a true sword. Deal 1d4 electrical and 1d4 fire damage on a strike, allowing the user to make a free attack against an opponent if they sunder armor the opponent is wearing. Emits light as per a torch when active. Will trigger the Thiwa’s light weaknesses without goggles.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>3D Tracking:</strong> Thiwa possess an amplified form of echolocation which allows them a full awareness of their surroundings. As they see in all directions at once, they cannot be caught unawares (always act in surprise rounds) and are never flat-footed. This allows them to effectively see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by spells such as deeper darkness. Their echolocation works out to the visual range, but they take double the penalties for perception checks due to loud volume. However, they cannot perceive color without light.<br /><strong>Thermal Vision:</strong> Thiwa primarily see heat but can see into the visual spectrum up through green light. This gives them a -4 penalty to any visual-based perception check.<br /><strong>Grabbing Appendages:</strong> Thiwa have a small group of appendages that are useful for little more than to aid in grappling. Thiwa gain Improved Grapple as a bonus feat, and can maintain a grapple and still make attacks with their main appendages.<br /><strong>Prehensile Tail:</strong> Thiwa have a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but they can retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action.<br /><strong>Sun OP, Plz Nerf:</strong> Thiwa are powerless in natural sunlight (this does not include light created by effects such as a daylight spell). A Thiwa caught in natural sunlight cannot attack and is staggered. Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds a Thiwa for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, she is dazzled as long as she remains in the affected area. Both are countered with tinted eyewear. All Thiwa start with protective eyewear of some form. Regardless of form it is easily removed, lost, or damaged with sunder attacks.<br /><strong>Grabbing Claws:</strong> Thiwa have a small group of appendages that are useful for little more than to aid in grappling. Thiwa gain Improved Grapple as a bonus feat, and can maintain a grapple and still make attacks with their main appendages. They can also be used to hold (but not retrieve or use) small objects.<br /><strong>Prehensile Tail:</strong> Thiwa have a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but they can retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action.<br /><b>Cling to Life:</b>Thiwa are immune to bleed damage, remain conscious until they reach -5 HP, and have a 50% chance to negate hit point loss from being in negative hit points until they reach -5 HP. At which point they loose consciousness.</p>

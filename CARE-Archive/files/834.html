  	  <h1>Identification Number/Code: 834 - Silkwing "Storybook Vampire"</h1>
    	<p><b>Entity Description:</b> Silkwing is a female thestral (commonly called "bat pony") of average height and build. Her fur is charcoal gray, her mane is deep purple, and her eyes are blood red. She bears a cutiemark of a waxing crescent moon partially obscured behind a dark cloud.</p>
    	<p>She possesses visible fangs, both thicker and longer than those of a normal thestral specimen. She is typically pleasant, well-behaved, and quite social.</p>
    	<p>Silkwing can be most easily identified by presenting her with any religious symbol, making her immediately recoil in terror. This is quite traumatic, and it is suggested asking mares suspected of being Silkwing how many grains of sand you are holding. If she begins counting them, but stops and is insulted or annoyed by your request, it is Silkwing.</p>
    	<p>Her appearance becomes progressively more corpse-like if starved, though her physical abilities improves as her from withers. While starving, her personality shifts to a predatory state wherein she becomes dangerous to ponies as she cannot prevent herself from consuming the majority or totality of their blood, resulting in death.</p>
    	</p>
    	<p><b>Care Protocols:</b> Silkwing is to be provided with 1 liter of fresh blood per month, sourced from Equestrian blood banks (Blood must not be type B-, see allergy notes). Provided she is fed at or above this rate, she remains healthy and almost indistinguishable from an ordinary pony.</p>
    	<p>Silkwing's residence will include a shallow moat constructed along the proper line. As Silkwing can not cross a body of running water by any means other than a bridge, any bridge over the moat is to be removed from her side of the property line, and a pump contained in a shed she does not own (and has not been invited into) is to be activated to circulate the water in the moat.</p>
    	<p>Should she be deprived of food for over two weeks, the moat should be infused with 50 ml of garlic oil and 20 grams of salt once a day for seven days. This infusion will cause Silkwing severe burns on contact (from which she will regenerate rapidly but continue to be repelled by). It should only be used if there is an imminent threat to the safety of her local community due to starvation.</p>
    	<p>The water should be drained, the moat cleaned, and fresh water added once Silkwing is no longer starving.
    	</p>
    	<p>While Silkwing's abilities and her reactions to sunlight, salt, and garlic are fixed, the specifics of her other powers and weaknesses are subject to the mass consensus of ponies relating to fictional vampires. Whatever the majority of ponies believe the vampires in fiction can do, or must do, Silkwing can/must do. As time goes on and real vampires have become common knowledge, Silkwings abilities have not changed to match conventional vampires, but rather have simply slowed or stopped changing entity. Despite this, a general review of public consensus via polls is to be preformed quarterly, and Silkwing's abilities are to be accessed once the polling is finished to compare them.</p>
    	<p>Presently, Silkwing can or must do the following:</p>
    	<ol>
      	<li>Shapeshifting</li>
      	<ul>
        	<li>Halving or doubling her natural size.</li>
        	<li>Transformation into a bat, wolf, or fog.</li>
        	<ol>
          	<li>Her fog form allows her to slip through any gap vapor can pass through.</li>
        	</ol>
        	<li>Able to "teleport" by transforming into dust then flying at impossible speeds, but only during a full moon with the moonlight contacting her body.</li>
      	</ul>
      	<li>Vampirism</li>
      	<ul>
        	<li>Silkwing can transform anyone she bites into a vampire by dripping her own blood into their bite wounds.</li>
        	<ol>
          	<li>Vampires Silkwing creates do not share her anomalous nature, and take the form of conventional Vampires.</li>
        	</ol>
        	<li>Able to mentally control individuals she has bitten within the last moon, compelling them to take any action she wishes.</li>
        	<li>Entirely sustained on a single meal of at least 1 liter of blood per moon cycle.</li>
        	<li>Able to control any vampire younger than herself via biting them as if she were feeding on a mortal.</li>
      	</ul>
      	<li>Necromancy</li>
      	<ul>
        	<li>Silkwing is able to animate and control any corpse of any creature.</li>
        	<ul>
          	<li>The age of the corpse or remains does not matter. Testing has proven she is fully capable of reanimating fossiles, though it appears to take much more effort.</li>
          	<li>Undead raised by Silkwing retain their memories and personalities, but can only express independent thought if she expressly orders them to.</li>
        	</ul>
      	</ul>
      	<li>Enhanced Physical Abilities</li>
      	<ul>
        	<li>Silkiwing's speed, strength, and stamina are on par with those of Princess Luna.</li>
        	<li>She is capable of regeneration sufficient to ignore small arms fire, provided it is not automatic or there are more than four shooters.</li>
        	<li>Presently, she can only be permanently harmed via a oak steak to the heart, followed by decapitation and having her head buried at lest 30 meters from her body, with her mouth stuffed with garlic and her neck stump salted on both sided. She claims to have returned form this state twice thanks to people deciding to place her head back on her body. She also claims to be conscious in this state.</li>
      	</ul>
      	<li>Limitations</li>
      	<ul>
        	<li>Bloodlust</li>
        	<ul>
          	<li>Silkwing is incapable of being non-violent when hungry, growing ever more dangerous as she starves.</li>
          	<li>Silkwing's sexual orientation determines her prefered prey while she is in the first stages of starvation. She will exclusively pursue male victims to sate her</li>
            	<ul>
              	<li>Stage 1 - Unable to prevent herself from aggressive posturing and threatening violence.</li>
              	<li>Stage 2 - Unable to prevent herself from attacking conventionally attractive males on sight.</li>
              	<li>Stage 3 - Unable to prevent herself from attacking most males on sight. (Silkwing notably has shown no violence towards effeminate stallions, even at 3 months of starvation.)</li>
              	<li>Stage 4 - Unable to prevent herself from attacking males or females on sight.</li>
              	<li>Stage 5 - Will begin to actively seek prey no matter if she wishes to or not.</li>
            	</ul>
          	<li>Silkwing will inevitably drain prey dry when feeding while starving. One victim is enough to return her to a healthy state.</li>
          	<li>She cannot be killed through starvation.</li>
        	</ul>
        	<li>Religious Symbolism</li>
        	<ul>
          	<li>Silkwing is repelled by holy symbols from all known religions, save for that of the cult known as the Brides of the Green.</li>
          	<ul>
            	<li>Investigation into this matter shows an ancient Highmare of the Brides once befriended Silkwing, and blessed her. From that point on, the religion's holy symbol no longer negatively impacted Silkwing. This also allowed the mare to try imbibing marijuana, as she could not previously approach the leaves.</li>
            	<li>Silkwing does not enjoy imbibing marijuana.</li>
          	</ul>
        	</ul>
        	<li>Death-Sleep</li>
        	<ul>
          	<li>Several times a year, Silkwing must return to her coffin for a week-long slumber.</li>
          	<li>This sleep cannot be interrupted, though in theory she could be killed via a stake to the heart during this vulnerable period.</li>
          	<li>Silkwing is capable of ensuring the Death-Sleep takes her at times which it is most convenient for her. Typically she uses this to skip unpleasant work duties, meetings, and angry bosses.</li>
        	</ul>
        	<li>Elemental Weaknesses</li>
        	<ul>
          	<li>Contact with sunlight, salt, or garlic causes Silkwing to burn as if on fire, yet there is no flame. She will heal at the expected rate.</li>
        	</ul>
        	<li>General Vampire Tropes</li>
        	<ul>
          	<li>Must count groups of the same object if asked to.</li>
          	<li>Must tell you she is a vampire if asked.</li>
          	<li>Unable to enter a structure she does now own without invitation.</li>
          	<li>Becomes visibly more corpse like as she grows hungry.</li>
          	<li>Supernaturally attractive.</li>
          	<ul>
            	<li>This is a weakness, not a strength, as it leads to constant distressing levels of harassment from typical individuals. Silkwing is largely introverted and prefers a quiet home life with a close circle of friends.</li>
          	</ul>
          	<li>Unable to cross bodies of water if the water is moving in a general flow.</li>
        	</ul>
      	</ul>
    	</ol>
    	<p><b>Interaction Guidelines:</b> Silkwing is almost entirely normal in terms of general interactions. While her vampiric nature is readily apparent one could easily mistake her for a typical example of vampires. She should be treated no different from anyone, save for during times of starvation.</p>
    	<p>Due to the specific nature of her condition there is a small number of behaviors one should avoid when interacting with Silkwing.</p>
    	<ol>
      	<li>Do not knock on her door by any means other than the included door knocker.</li>
      	<ul>
        	<li>Knocks should be light and rapid.</li>
        	<li>Guests should knock exactly six times.</li>
      	</ul>
      	<li>Under no circumstances should anyone bring up the sun or sunlight.</li>
      	<ul>
        	<li>If she brings up the subject, talking about the subject is permitted.</li>
      	</ul>
      	<li>If injured in any way which draws blood, immediately make your leave of her presence.</li>
      	<ul>
        	<li>If further interaction is required, the wound must be fully sealed. Contact adhesive is sufficient for this task.</li>
      	</ul>
      	<li>Silkwing can eat normal foods, but does not need to. She feels compelled to eat to be polite. No meals prepared for her may include salt or garlic.</li>
    	</ol>
      </p>
    	<p>Historical Background: Silkwing first appeared at the Hollow Shades Home for Monstrosities on the 8th of Harvestide, 116 SE. She arrived under the presumption that her "fellow vampires" would be willing to join her on her quest to "Defeat the sun". She was shocked to learn true vampires are merely reduced in power in sunlight rather than harmed by it. Realizing this was a vampire unrelated to his lineage (and therefore shouldn't exist) Count Damsire Scrati informed CARE of Silkwing's existence.</p>
    	<p>Silkwing voluntarily elected to Evergreen Falls after being informed of CARE's duty to protect unusual individuals, and being promised a home, possible friends, employment, and protection from the sun. Silkwing lacked any knowledge of Celestia's control over the sun, and continues to not know of this fact to this day (It is presumed she might be hurt attempting to fight Celestia if she ever learns of the Princess's link to the sun.).</p>
    	<p>Due to not requiring sleep while being housebound during the day, Silkwing requested a job she could preform from home. After some debate, she was directly hired by CARE to serve as a Containment Monitor Agent. She greatly enjoyed this roll within our organization and has proven to be a commendable employee and valued asset.</p>
    	<p><b>Behavioral Patterns:</b> Silkwing is a most normal individual, albeit quite introverted when put into the position of interacting with more than two individuals at a time. She's driven, dedicated, loyal, and kind. Starvation situations excepted, of course.</p>
    	<p>Due to her typical behavior being indistinguishable from a normal mare, Silkwing is classified as a Type II Threat, and as such needs only the basic necessities of life to pose no danger to anypony. Excepting of course Princess Celestia, due to Silkwing's irrational hatred of the sun. In light of this danger, Silkwing is not cleared to read her own file, nor are any personnel allowed to inform her of Celestia's nature. Citizens are reminded to ensure she continues to belive the Celestia-Sun connection is symbolic and metaphorical rather than literal.</p>
    	<p><b>Research and Analysis:</b> [Present findings from research conducted on the anomaly, including scientific experiments, tests, or attempts to understand its nature or abilities. Include observations from experts or researchers, along with any theories or hypotheses.]</p>
    	<p><b>Associated Risks and Precautions:</b> In the event of a supply disruption, Silkwing is to be contained using the previously described moat protocall. Under no circumstance should residents of her community employ a blood drive to attempt to sate her hunger. If Silkwing is within scent range of previous victims (including blood doners she did not directly drink from) she will seek them out with increased aggression during subsequent starvation states.</p>
    	<p><b>Incident Reports:</b> None. Silkwing is a model employee and good citizen. The seven starvation states she has endured within CARE's protection are formally classified as instances of illness as they have not been her doing.</p>

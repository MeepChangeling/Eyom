<p>The days of knights in shining armor sharing into battle atop their mighty steeds ahead of a forest of pikemen are long over. Gunpowder put an end to such things. It was a long and slow death, pockmarked with countless incidents of damn fools who believed the bow to be king only to paint the soil in the blood of their men.</p>
<p>Those battles too are long past. The humble gun has grown into its prime, and while many carry a melee tool to war, the self-contained metal cartridge is the new king. Wars are fought at distances unimagined by the great-grandparents of modern soldiers. The mass formations of yesteryear are gone, replaced by small squads working as independent units according to premade plans from the officers who dispatched them.</p>
<p>Modern warfare is its own beast, one which soldiers fear has yet to reach its peak. A new kind of soldier was required for the battlefields of today. Soldiers that know how to operate according to plan without officers breathing down their necks. Soldiers who can both stand and fight and run and hide. Soldiers who can rely on minimal armor and standardized equipment due to the extreme costs of levying armies. Soldiers who are willing to spend their lives as professional soldiers within a standing army, learning and practicing their assigned specialization.</p>
<p>Thus the Army Regular was born. The lowly person in a cloth uniform with a rifle, a knife, and a helmet who sits in the trenches, waiting for the order to fight and die for their country. Whatever that country may be. These are the salt of the earth working warriors of the modern age. The many, the filthy, the grunts.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: See Specialization</p>
<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 5d6 &times; 10 gp (average 175 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with equipment relevant to their specialization, and a single one handed firearm of their choice.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Class Features</h4>
<p class="initial">All of the following are class features of the Regular.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: All Regulars are proficient with all firearms, simple and marshal weapons, and light armor.</p>
<p><strong>Regular's Training</strong>: At first level, Army Regulars are given intense training to bring them to the peak of physical performance. They gain +10 move speed, count as if their strength were 2 points higher for the purposes of encumbered, and a +1 bonus to fortitude saves.</p>

<p><strong>Bound Weapon</strong>: Army Regulars start play with a single magic weapon (exactly what depends on their specialization). This weapon is bound to their very soul in order to prevent the enemy from making use of their weapon. Regulars can call their weapon to them as a free action should they ever become separated from it, effectively allowing them to pull their weapon out of nowhere. Their weapons conjure their own ammunition at a fixed rate (rate dependent on weapon, see specialization). This rate is set to a low level outside of wartime to allow Regulars to keep in practice as well as use their weapons for personal defense. Any army officer can enable the weapon to have practically infinite ammunition for a set period of time.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization</strong>: Starting at 1st level, an Army Regular chooses their specialization. This choice determines what their role within the military is and consequently what they have been trained to do for a squad of soldiers. This choice cannot be changed after it has been made. The specializations are:</p>

	<select id="target">
            <option value="content_0">Select...</option>
            <option value="content_1">Pyrotechnic</option>
            <option value="content_2">Medic</option>
            <option value="content_3">Demolition Expert</option>
			<option value="content_4">Engineer</option>
			<option value="content_5">Heavy Gunner</option>
			<option value="content_6">Marksman</option>
			<option value="content_7">Soldier</option>
        </select>

<!-- Select -->

 <div id="content_0" class="vis">
 <p>Army Regulars are split into several specializations. Each specialization is specifically trained for one of the roles within a modern military squad. The specializations are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Soldier</em>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">A jack of all trades which serves as the backbone of the modern military.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><em>Demolition Expert</em><br />
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">A specialist who is trained to handle explosive ordinance.</li>

<!-- Pyro -->

 <div id="content_1" class="inv">
<p><strong>Pyrotechnic</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3%;"><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d6</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3%;">Pyrotechnics are trained to make use of flame-based weapons, typically magical in nature. Their job is to clear enamy fortifications and defend allied fortifications. For this task, they have been given effective terror weapons, typically a simple flame thrower but occasionally other means of dispersing flame across large areas such as napalm lobbers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3%;">Pyrotechnics start play with a flamethrower (3d4 fire damage, 15-foot cone, DC 15 reflex halves, 20 charges, self-recharges 1 charge per 5 minutes), a gas mask, and Pyro Armor, a long coat which has been doped with flame retardant material (Acts as quilted armor with a resist fire 5 enchantment), and gain the skill Use Magical Device as a class skill.</p>


<p><strong>Professionalism (Ex):</strong> Professionals have standards. Starting at 2nd level, Army Regulars gain those standards. So long as they have living allies in combat, every attack roll, save, and CMB check gains a +1 moral bonus. Should any ally be reduced to 0 HP, incapacitated, or killed, this bonus increases by 1d6+1 for CHA+1 rounds. Should multiple allies be downed, this ability stacks with itself by increasing the duration.</p>
<p>This ability improves every 4 levels thereafter. The bonus is increased according to <i>Table: The Army Regular</i>, the bonus to checks, bonus to the d6 roll, and number of rounds, all increase according to the table.</p>

<p><strong>Army Training</strong>: At 3rd level, and at every level indicated on <i>Table: The Army Regular</i> thereafter, a Army Regular gains a teamwork feat. These feats must be selected from those listed as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats/">Teamwork Feats</a>.</p>
<p>Army Training allows an Army Regular to quickly teach others any teamwork feat they know. With 8 hours of practice, any allies an Army Regular has are able to benefit from one of their teamwork feats as if they all had the ability. The ally must be within 100 feet of the Regular to benefit from their teamwork feats.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: At 4nd level, and at every level indicated on <i>Table: The Army Regular</i> thereafter, a Army Regular gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the Army Regular gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats">Combat Feats</a>, sometimes also called &ldquo;Fighter bonus feats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon reaching 8th level, and every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and so on), a Army Regular can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the Army Regular loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A Army Regular can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization II</strong>: At 5th level, a Pyrotechnic has learned to manipulate their weapon into something far more terrifying. Enemies who fail their save vs the Pyro's weapon are automatically lit on fire for 1d4+CHA rounds.</p>


<p><strong>Specialization III</strong>: At 10th level, a Pyrotechnic has learned there are other things a flamer can spray aside form burning stuff. They can now change the damage type of their flame thrower between fire and acid as a swift action.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization IV</strong>: At 15th level, a Pyrotechnic gains the ability to make a 60 foot line attack with their flamer as a full-round action. This can be used CHA times per day.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization V</strong>: At 20th level, a Pyrotechnic gains the ability to spend 2 charges of their class weapon to make an attack against every enemy within 30 feet of themselves. This attack deals double damage, and automatically lights the targets on fire. The fire continues to burn until they die.</p>
</div>

<!-- Medic -->


<div id="content_2" class="inv">
<p><strong>Medic</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d6</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">Medics are trained to assist their comrades, keeping them in fighting shape by any means possible. Their job is to pull the wounded back into cover, dress and heal all wounds they can treat, and protect the wounded with their life. For this task, they have been issued simple weapons as well as specialist tools.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">Medics start play with a blowback pistol (1d6 damage 19-20 x2, range 15, capacity 12), a Medic's Field Kit (counts as Mastercraft tools for healing checks and providing long-term care), gain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/brew-potion-item-creation">Brew Potion</a> as a bonus feat, and can craft healing related potions as if they were a Cleric of equal level. All healing potions created by a Medic heal the subject for an additional amount of HP equal to the Medic's CHA.</p>

<p><strong>Professionalism (Ex):</strong> Professionals have standards. Starting at 2nd level, Army Regulars gain those standards. So long as they have living allies in combat, every attack roll, save, and CMB check gains a +1 moral bonus.

These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats">Combat Feats</a>, sometimes also called &ldquo;Fighter bonus feats.&rdquo;</p>

A Army Regular can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization II</strong>: At 5th level, a Medic has discovered a means of making potions last. Each cure potion they brew can be used CHA times before it is depleted.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization III</strong>: At 10th level, a Medic has learned how to bring someone back from the brink of death. As a full-round action, a Medic can restore any character who has been dead for less than their CHA mod rounds to life and 1 hit point.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization IV</strong>: At 15th level, a Medic can restore someone to full hitpoints with 4 hours of dedicated medical care, provided the patient is able to lay or sit for the entire company. This can be performed on up to CHA mod people at once.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization V</strong>: At 20th level, a Medic has learned to brew a potion that renders the drinker indestructible for 1d4+CHA rounds. They can produce CHA potions per day. These potions expire after 24 hours.</p>

<!-- Demolition Expert -->

<div id="content_3" class="inv">
<p><strong>Demolition Expert</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">Demolition Experts are trained in destroying enemy fortifications, vehicles, and general demolition techniques relating to explosives. For this task they have been issued a fireball cannon, one specially modified to have a good old kinetic thumping along with the fwoosh.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">Demolition Experts start with a Kinetic Rod Cannon (3d4 damage (fire/force), 10 foot AoE, range increment 15, 10 charges, replenishes 1 per minute), and gain the Alchemist's <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Alchemist/#TOC-Bomb-Su-">Bomb</a> class feature as an Alchemist of equal level, and count as an Alchemist for the purpose of taking feats (or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Alchemist/#TOC-Discovery-Su-">Discoveries</a> related to bombs.</p>

<p><strong>Professionalism (Ex):</strong> Professionals have standards. Starting at 2nd level, Army Regulars gain those standards.

<p>This ability improves every 4 levels thereafter. The bonus is increased according to <i>Table: The Army Regular</i>, the bonus to checks, bonus to the d6 roll, and number of rounds, all increase according to the table.</p>

<p><strong>Army Training</strong>: At 3rd level, and at every level indicated on <i>Table: The Army Regular</i> thereafter, a Army Regular gains a teamwork feat. These feats must be selected from those listed as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats/">Teamwork Feats</a>.</p>
<p>Army Training allows an Army Regular to quickly teach others any teamwork feat they know. With 8 hours of practice, any allies an Army Regular has are able to benefit from one of their teamwork feats as if they all had the ability. The ally must be within 100 feet of the Regular to benefit from their teamwork feats.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: At 4nd level, and at every level indicated on <i>Table: The Army Regular</i> thereafter, a Army Regular gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the Army Regular gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats">Combat Feats</a>, sometimes also called &ldquo;Fighter bonus feats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon reaching 8th level, and every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and so on), a Army Regular can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the Army Regular loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A Army Regular can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization II</strong>: At 5th level, a Demolition Expert has discovered a way to set their bombs to explode on a delay. They can place one of their bombs on a surface, where it will stick for up to CHA rounds at which point it will explode. The Demolition Expert can choose to detonate their bomb at any time as an immediate action.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization III</strong>: At 10th level, a Demolition Expert gains the ability to instinctively know where to plant explosives to deal maximum damage. Any time they stick a bomb to a target, they do so at just the right place, and thereby double their damage.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization IV</strong>: At 15th level, a Demolition Expert gains the ability to use 2 charges of their class weapon to allow the projectile to seek a target like a magic missile. This ability can be used once per 1d10-CHA rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Engineer</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d4</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">Engineers are trained in the use of War Totems and construct turrets, as well as general maintenance and construction of fortifications. For this purpose, they have been issued a War Totem and a talisman that conjures construct turrets, and a second talisman for barricades and fortifications.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">Engineers begin with a War Totem (Charge rate 0.75, Reservoir 10, range 60 ft), as well as a talisman of Conjure Lesser Construct Turret and a talisman of Fortify. They also gain Knowledge (Engineering) and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device">Disable Device</a> as class skills.</p>
<p>War Totems are a far more expensive variety of totem due to their compact size and low weight. They take the form of a large wooden box roughly half the size of a camping backpack and weigh approximately 22 pounds. The harness of each War Totem distributes its weight evenly, giving it an effective weight of 18 pounds when worn. The upper section of a War Totem includes a storage compartment for up to 2 cubic feet of items.</p>
<p>War Totems can discharge energy while being worn but the box needs to be opened to allow the collectors to recharge. While this can be done with the totem worn on one's back, it is not practical to do so in combat or indoors, imposing a -10 penalty to acrobatics checks as well as a -2 penalty to AC. An Engineer's War Totem and Talismins are bound to them, allowing them to be summoned if they are sperated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 7%;"><strong>Conjure Lesser Construct Turret </strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">You summon a small, immobile construct turret that occupies the square and shoots conjured mundane ammunition at the closest armed and unallied creature (Unless it is manually/remotely directed to shoot a specific target as a swift action). The turret must be deployed after it is summoned (this is a swift action) within five minutes or it is unsummoned and the energy for its summoning is returned to the totem. The turret has an attack roll of CHA+5 and deals 1d6+DEX damage, has a range of 20 feet and has a critical of x3. Each turret has an AC of 15 and 35 hit points and a hardness of 5. Once placed a turret has enough energy to continue operating for 2 hours (per Regular level), after which point it vanishes.</p>
<p>An Engineer may summon a turret every 1d4 rounds, and can pickup a deployed turret to move it as a standard action, and can set it back down in their current square as a free action.  An engineer can have up to their CHA of turrets out at once, but may only manually order up to their INT turrets to fire manually per round (minimum 1).</p>

By pushing or pulling the terrain away from or toward a central point and piling it at the outer edges of the area of effect, you can rapidly create a mundane safe-zone for sudden combat.</p>

<li style="margin-left: 12%;">Create a chest-high wall that provides partial cover to standing people and full cover to anyone crouching or sitting prone.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 12%;">Seals openings in a structure such as doors, windows, and holes by jamming them up with debris.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 10%;">If the area of effect completely contains a creature&rsquo;s space, including the caster, that creature must make a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save or fall <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone">prone</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Professionalism (Ex):</strong> Professionals have standards. Starting at 2nd level, Army Regulars gain those standards. So long as they have living allies in combat, every attack roll, save, and CMB check gains a +1 moral bonus. Should any ally be reduced to 0 HP, incapacitated, or killed, this bonus increases by 1d6+1 for CHA+1 rounds. Should multiple allies be downed, this ability stacks with itself by increasing the duration.</p>
<p>This ability improves every 4 levels thereafter. The bonus is increased according to <i>Table: The Army Regular</i>, the bonus to checks, bonus to the d6 roll, and number of rounds, all increase according to the table.</p>

<p><strong>Army Training</strong>: At 3rd level, and at every level indicated on <i>Table: The Army Regular</i> thereafter, a Army Regular gains a teamwork feat. These feats must be selected from those listed as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats/">Teamwork Feats</a>.</p>
<p>Army Training allows an Army Regular to quickly teach others any teamwork feat they know. With 8 hours of practice, any allies an Army Regular has are able to benefit from one of their teamwork feats as if they all had the ability. The ally must be within 100 feet of the Regular to benefit from their teamwork feats.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: At 4nd level, and at every level indicated on <i>Table: The Army Regular</i> thereafter, a Army Regular gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the Army Regular gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats">Combat Feats</a>, sometimes also called &ldquo;Fighter bonus feats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon reaching 8th level, and every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and so on), a Army Regular can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the Army Regular loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A Army Regular can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization II</strong>: At 5th level, an Engineer has tweaked their talismans to be more useful. They now summon Construct Turrets (damage improves to 2d4). Their Fortify talisman can now affect up to 6 squares.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization III</strong>: At 10th level, an Engineer has tweaked their totem. It improves by gaining the following stats: Recharge 2, Reservoir 20, Range 150.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization IV</strong>: At 15th level, an Engineer gains the ability to pacify any construct system. This takes the form of a Knowledge Engineering roll (DC 10 + 1/2 Construct's level + INT). If the roll succeeds the Construct will treat the Engineer and up to CHA allies as friendly for one hour per level. This check can be made again after 1d4 rounds, either to add more allies to the friendly list, or to attempt to persuade the construct to help the Engineer. If the construct is made to help the Engineer it remains helpful for one minute per character level. In order to use this ability the Engineer must be within 10 feet of the construct they are attempting to manipulate. They may not manipulate the same construct more than twice per day.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization V</strong>: At 20th level, an Engineer's War Totem is improved to the maximum in each category. They also improve their talismans, gaining Greater Construct Turret (3d4 19-20 x2), and Fortify can now be used on worked materials and structures.</p>

<p><strong>Heavy Gunner</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">Heavy Gunners are tasked with providing covering fire for their squads, as well as taking down heavily armored targets.

The capacity of their class weapon increases by 10.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization IV</strong>: At 15th level, a Heavy Gunner learns how to use their class weapon for indirect fire. Provided there is an opening above a target of at least 5 feet in diameter, the Heavy Gunner ignores cover bonuses. The capacity of their class weapon increases by 10.</p>

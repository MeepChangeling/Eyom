<h3 class="articletitle">Rulesets</h3>
<p>The following rulesets have been developed for use in Eyom, as well as the world of Zo at large. Their use is optional, but highly reccomended as the Pathfinder RPG was never intended for a world set in the 1800s, and carries many of the problems with D&D based RPGs. No offence to Mr. Gigax, he lived in the grim darkness of the pre-internet times.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><a href="safeshirts.html">Sufficiently Safe Shirts</a></h4>
<p>A rebalanced, revised, and adjusted set of armor rules, intended to replace the vanilia armor rules. Primarily reworks of existing armor, such that each armor has its practical purpose via unique special properties. Also contains some Eyom Specific Armors created using these rules.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><a href="shootybangs.html">Sufficiently Shooty Shootybangs</a></h4>
<p>A full rule replacment for firearms, including a system for creating firearms (in terms of stats). Based on the realities of firearms, rather than whatever the fuck Pathfinder's Devs were thinking. Well tested, and proven to be fun, dangerious, and dangeriously fun.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><a href="swooshysticks.html">Sufficiently Swooshy Sticks</a></h4>
<p>A full system for creating unique melee weapons of all kinds, as well as an alternate system for melee attacks which is intended to better represent the realities of melee combat while remaining simple, quick, and fun to use.</p>

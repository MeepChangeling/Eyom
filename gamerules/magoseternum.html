<h3 class="articletitle" >Magos Eternum</h3>
<p>Eternal life is a common pursuit for many spellcasters. Of these ways the majority of the living who wish to live forever turn to undeath. The classic example of such transformations being the litch. Eyom has liches, but such creatures are expressly bound to the realm of wizardry.</p>
<p>This is not to say Sourcerors, Clerics, Bards, Druids, and other casters have no means of preserving their consciousness through death. Indeed, the opposite is true. For every source of power, there is a unique penical of undeath for mages to asppire to. They are as follows:</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="litch">Old Litch</h4>
<p><b>Class:</b> Wizard</p>
<p><b>Alignment Shift:</b> Any Evil</p>
<p><b>Power Source:</b> Secret Knowledge</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Lore</p>
<p>The term litch has become something of a generic term for an undead spellcaster of any sort. Several other methods to achieve a similar but less powerful result have been discovered over the years, and are used by many mages who do not become evil, nor require the consumption of souls. Hence the formalized title of Old Litch was coined for the those wizards who seek the oldest, most powerful, most dangerious, and crulest form of litchdom.</p>
<p>Litchification (in its original form) is a dark arcane ritual discovered by the Gnollish Wizard Zhuihn ​vyim Rolɑrtɑrusg during the 4th century. It preserves the soul of those who preform it, at the cost of making them exceptionally self centered and greedy. The lich's soul is preserved within a reliquary (aka phylactery, though a phylactery is a lesser version of a reliquary) which may be any object of the litch's choosing, so long as the object is of such significance to them personally, that the would-be-litch values it as much as their own life.</p>
<p>Once a reliquary is selected, the litch brews a potion, the key ingredient of which is the blood of an innocent, who must be ritualistically sacrificed on a specially prepared alter (a child is typically used for this purpose).</p>
<p>The alter is to be the home of their reliquary forever more. It shall not be moved from its place atop the alter, lest the spell be broken and the litch succumb to death. While a weakness, the alter is also a power, for it grants the litch absolute dominion over the very lands surrounding the dark alter.</p>
<p>The would-be-litch must anoint their reliquary with half of the potion, then consume the other half. Immediately thereafter, the would-be-litch dies. Their physical form dissolves away to nothing, leaving their concious soul stranded on the material plane as the ritual rips it apart, bending it forever more to the reliquary.</p>
<p>Once the soul has been bound to its unliving vessel, the litch is able to construct a body for itself. This body must take the form of an undead creature, with the only limit being the litch's form cannot excede the power of their soul at the time the body is forged. A litch could take the form of a ghoul, morgh, banshee, or dracholitch, whatever pleases it and is unambiguously a reanimated corpse. This body is their remote vessel with which to interact with the world beyond the place they have left their reliquary.</p>
<p>Should this body be destroyed, the litch can create a new form in a process taking 10 days. The new form can be a more powerful creature than its previous body, as the litch is not static, and can grow in power and spiritual refinement as any living being would. To truly slay a litch, one must destroy its phylactery, a process made quite difficult given the litch's awareness of its surroundings, and control over the lands near their soul's resting place.</p>
<p>A litch's undeath is sustained by the souls of living victims. Each litch requires one soul per degree of spiritual refinement it has obtained on a yearly basis.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Sah">Sah Mummy</h4>
<p><b>Class:</b> Divine Casters</p>
<p><b>Alignment Shift:</b> None</p>
<p><b>Power Source:</b> Primordial Ritual</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> </p>
<p class="sectionhead">Lore</p>
<p>Sah Mummies are an ancient creation of a people lost to time. The process and name of which came to High Priest Hilda ​Masterson in a vision sent by a dead god. The transformation is a harrowing ordeal, requireing many assistants, and seventy seven days of torture for the subject, but results in a form of undeath which brings an enduring existance without altering the recipitant's soul and general personage.</p>
<p>Any person who has learned to channel divine power from any source may become a Sah Mummy. This person is known as the Repentant for the duration of their transformation. The Repentant is placed on a strict diet of milk and honey, which they must remain faithful to for a month prior to the beginning of their transformation all the while being in proximity to food they delight in. Should the Repentant consume any other food during this time, they will die during their transformation as a form of punishment.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of their fast, the Repentant is taken to a specially prepared chamber much akin to a mortuary. There they are chained to a slab for the safety of their attendants. They are then slowly mummified while being preserved in a living state through the use of common magics in a specific sequence at a regular regime, while sacred incense burns day and night.</p>
<p>The attendants begin by removing all of Repentant's organs that might decay rapidly. Usually beginning with the brain by carefully inserting blessed hooks through the nostrils to remove the brain piece by piece. Should this not be the first step in the process, the removal of the tongue and vocal chords most certainly is. The Repentant's face is often destroyed during this process, in which case it will be replaced with a death mask fashioned form materials sacred to those who preform the ritual.</p>
<p>Next, the attendants removed the organs of the abdomen and chest through an incision on the left side of the abdomen. The the heart (or hearts) is left within the Repentant's chest, which is then packed with blessed herbs and sacred salts to dry out the body while infusing it with a steady supply of positive energy. This transmutes the Repentant's heart into the true core of their physical being, becoming the home to their mind, soul, and mystical power.</p>
<p>Every organ removed from the Repentant is carefully packed into sacred jars which are tied to the Repentant's developing unlife as the key to preserving their personage through the ritual. At this stage, the Repentant's eyes are replaced with large uncut gemstones of exceptional clarity (diamonds, sapphires, rubies, tourmalines, and jets are common).</p>
<p>When the Repentant's body has dried out completely (and at least 77 days have passed), the attendants bathe the Repentant, cleaning their body to the utmost degree of cleanliness before it is annointed with sacred oils and tattooed with the practitioner's holy symbol and litanies to their divine of choice, passages from their scriptures, the philosophies they hold dear, or any combination of the three.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Repentant is wrapped in linen or silk cloth which has been prepared with daily blessings, spells, and rituals since the beginning of the Repentant's transformation. Once swaddled, the Repentant is given in amulets of power, and their wrists, ankles, and collar are covered in jewelry fashioned from a pure metal (often gold, silver, platinum, or copper). A matching mask if often added at this stage, but is not necessary for the transformation.</p>
<p>Once the body has been prepared in this fashion, the still conscious and living Repentant must remain bound to the slab until their next birthday. Then, and only then, can a hour long ritual sermon preformed by the priest overseeing their transformation grant unto the Repentant their undeath. The chant takes away the pain and suffering, purifying the Repentant's form of all mortal distractions, limitations, and vices... Or so it is said. In practice, it enables the Repentant to rise from their slab, undergo years of mental healing, and then resume their life as a far more powerful, enduring, undead version of their former self, albeit irrevocably changed by their suffering.</p>
<p>Those who undergo the process become more directly attuned to the divine energies natural present within the world, and can learn to manipulate the world as gods do. While not true divines, they no longer need be linked to their chosen god to do all they could in life, and indeed, discover far more effective and potent means of using holy powers in their undeath. indeed, their spiritual journey of development, refinement, and empowerment continues so long as they retain their personage.</p>
<p>Should the jars containing a Sah Mummy's organs be destroyed, they loose their personhood, becoming more and more of a mindless monster as each jar is lost.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Maestro">Maestro</h4>
<p><b>Class:</b> Bard</p>
<p><b>Alignment Shift:</b> Any Neutral or Evil</p>
<p><b>Power Source:</b> Living Memory</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Lore</p>
<p>A piece of everyone remains alive through the memories held of them by those they leave behind. Many cultures have rituals designed to keep the memory of those lost alive. While not intended to be magical in nature, these rituals touch upon the softest edges of a deep magic created and sustained by the very hearts and minds of all mortal kind. Maestros are undead which learned to tap into the very core of this eternal font of tremendous power.</p>
<p>The process by which one becomes a Maestro is simple, yet borders on the impossible. It begins with a work of art. Maestros call this work their magnum opus, and indeed, should any works deserve the tile, it is these. A Maestro can spend decades crafting their work, which is no mere work of art, but a grand spell created through a ritual each Maestro must discover for themselves as each version is as unique as the work of art which embodies it. Every brushstroke, graver scribe, note, pencil line, or word acts as an individual component of this ritual, and must be prefect not only within the context of the rules of the deep magic, but also within the artistic craft of the Maestro's work.</p>
<p>Once finished, the work becomes the vessel for the Maestro's soul. So long as the art, or its creator, is remembered by even a single soul the Maestro cannot truly die. This power is not limited to the original work. Each time the work is copied, so too are the magical properties imbued within by the Maestros, for the art itself is the vessel for their soul, not the physical manifestation of that work of art.</p>
<p>The Maestro's Magnum Opus is somewhat infectious. More so than any normal great work of its kind. It has a way of worming into the minds of others, of becoming something they cherish and hold dear to themselves. The art makes sure it is remembered, preserved, and embedded within the culture of its birth.</p>
<p>There will come a time after the Maestro's work ahs circulated sufficiently that the Maestro will know their work has spread enough for the spell to have finished. At this point, the Maestro hosts a grand event, be it a ball, art gallery, performance, or any other means by which their art can be displayed in a grandiose fashion. This event will be the last night of their life, for as the audience's adoration of them reaches its peek, they will begin their transformation, and at the end of the event, they will die.</p>
<p>A year and a day after the Maestro's death, they rise again, appearing as they did in the prime of their life, though imbued with the power of the undead, and with access to the deep magic by which they were created. Their reformation binds the location of their final performance to the ritual and their unlife. It becomes an extension of themselves, as immortal and undead as the Maestro themselves. Perishing as they perish, returning as they return.</p>
<p>This unlife comes at a cost. Once reanimated, the Maestro can never create new works in the artform they used to create their Magnum Opus, though they can recreate or perform any work they made before their death, save their Magnum Opus. The work must stand on its own as a cultural touch stone, or be remembered by at least one soul through its own merits for the Maestro's undeath to be sustained. Should they be forgotten, they fade away to nothing over the course of seven days. Yet, at any point in the future, should their Magnum Opus be rediscovered, they will return once more until they are forgotten again.</p>
<p>A Maestro appears living, young should their memory be kept alive by many, aging only as their work leaves the public eye, and appearing as a withered yet mobile mummified corpse when but a few remember their art, and fading to a mere phantasm when known by but a single soul. As their physical form waxes and wanes, so too does the location to which they are tied. Many know of a Maestro's return by the appearance of a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUQOdXZRvC8">ruined concert hall returning from the past</a>, harmlessly making space for itself within the heart of the city by pushing that which came after it to the sides.</p>
<p>If slain, a Maestro reforms within their bound location at the hour of their death.</p>

<p><b>Class:</b> Sorcerer</p>
<p><b>Alignment Shift:</b> Any Lawful</p>
<p><b>Power Source:</b> Magic itself</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Lore</p>
<p>A Font Arcana, or Source of Magic, also known as a Source, is a sorcerer which shed their physical form to become an incorporeal and undead entity which takes the form of pure arcane magical forces.</p>
<p>Few Sourcerors can become a Source. Those who can know of their potential from an early age, often developing a god complex due to knowing their potential to achieve power byond mortal ken, and even beyond the divine's reach. Even amongst those with the potential, only a select few will forgo developing the arrogance of their peers enough to follow the path laid before them by the universe itself.</p>
<p>To become a Source, one must understand magic as a whole. Not only in the form of feeling the power within and mastering its intuitive use, but by coming to understand the very nature of magic itself in ways a mere wizard cannot begin to seen, nor appreciate. An aspiring Source must observe magic working at its smallest and humble of scales, as well as its grandest and far reaching. They must both understand and utilize every aspect of the realm of the unreal within their craft. They must come to know magic not as an unknowable force, nor a source of power, nor even a force of nature, but as themselves.</p>
<p>A Source is a Sorcerer whose understanding of magic has led them to not only believe they are a being of magic rather than a crude construct of matter, but to know this for certainty, and to be able to articulate exactly why and how this is true with such simplicity even a child could understand. Once this can be accomplished, the Sorcerer is ready for their ascension.</p>
<p>They will travel to a place and time known to them by virtue of their enlightenment, and there they will unleash the full might and breath of their power, transforming the location as the universe dictates, acting the pen of the universe itself. This process weaves the Sorcerer with the place in such a way that there is no difference between the two. As the sorcerer lives, so too does the place chosen by the universe. It becomes a place of power, a font of magic by which others can become sourcerors, or otherwise be infused by magical power.</p>
<p>Once this is completed, the Sorcerer has solidified their fate. They will continue to live as they have until such a time as they happen to perish. As their body succumbs to death, their self remains, taking the form of a wraith-like creature composed of pure magical energy, their soul, and of course, their mind.</p>
<p>This phantasmal form can traverse the world as it pleases, as it is bound by nothing save the will of the Source itself. Yet, this enduring and powerful form comes at a cost. The place of power they created must be maintained and upkeep. For the truth of the Source is they are a source of magic. A living part of the universe, acting to keep that which the laws of magic have ordained as they should be. Should the Place of Power be desecrated, the source will perish along with its power.</p>
<p>If slain, the Source will reform at their place of power within a few hours.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle" id="Crone">Crone</h4>
<p><b>Class:</b> Witch</p>
<p><b>Alignment Shift:</b> None</p>
<p><b>Power Source:</b> Ancient Spirits</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Lore</p>
<p>Witches, being witches, make no distinction between crones and Crones. The title is afforded to all of their elder peers as a means of throwing off those who know of their most arcane of secrets. A form of undeath which may very well not be undeath, but something else entirely.</p>
<p>There are things of power in the world. Everyone knows this fact, yet few know how common these things are. A humble pebble might be charged with natural energies sufficient to return a loved one from the dead, yet such a grand thing is most rare. A On the other hand, almost any pebble might be able to change the fortunes of one who plucks it from the riverbank.</p>
<p>The source of this power are spirits of the land. Ancient entitis bound to none and more often than not more mechanical than animalistic. It is the duty of the witch to shepherd these spirits. To guide them, to rear them, and make use of their power lest its potential go to waste. Some exceptionally talented and wise witches are able to forgo their patrons and derive their power entirely from these spirits. Those who do such a thing have unknowingly changed their fates.</p>
<p>Over time, the more intelligent spirits will murmur and whisper the barest snatches of ancient secrets. Lore and knowledge they wish their loving shepherd to know nad make use of. Gifts of the land. These gifts are potent on their own, but when aggregated over many years they begin to point to a great truth. The existence of spirits so old and powerful they are as gods.</p>
<p>A Crone is a witch who has made a pact with one or more of these ancient spirits. The pact is simple. The ancient sprit has a task it needs accomplished. The witch will perform this task in exchange for a reward, eternal life.</p>
<p>Each task is different, ranging from the simple yet inconvenient, to the complex and nightmarish. As soon as the witch has accomplished the task, they will collapse, dropping dead as their soul is plucked from their body and reformed. No more are they a mortal being, but rather a spirit themselves. One which is promptly stitched back into their mortal shel to infuse them with all of the capabilities a spirit lacks. They are then free to do as the please, so long as they live in a sacred place deep in the heart of nature, one chosen by the ancient spirit. Crones serve as the eternal guardians of these holy to nature itself locations.</p>
<p>The resulting Crone has a harared, dead-yet-alive appearance, and is capable of everything it was in life, yet can now directly draw upon the mystical powers of spirits for those powers are their own. Their hybrid existence is most potent, requiring a multi-step process to kill. The Crone must be cut down by silver blessed on the night of a full moon by immersion in the water of a virgin spring. Her head must be cut from her body, and buried twelve paces north of where she fell. The mouth must be stuffed with three cloves of garlic. She is to be dismembered, the torso buried where she fell, and each limb buried seven paces to the north west, south west, south east, and north east. A fire is to be set over each of her parts, and sacred incense is to be burned on the fires for three days and three nights. Lest the Crone reform a year and a day after their demise and pursue its killer as a revenant does its target before resuming their business.</p>
<p>Should the garlic be removed by any means, including insects nibbling, or mere passage of time and rot, the Crone will rise again. No means of truly permanently killing a Crone has yet been found.</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Lore</p>
<p>There is an ancient and persistent rumor amongst those living in the deep hills and dark forests of the world that some places are more than places. These places are alive in the way a person is, able to move and change themselves for their own ends, and invariably, hostile to most intelligent life. Most official sources discount these rumors, yet there is one small organization, beholden to none and comprised of volunteers, which not only begs to differ with the conventional opinion, but has marked many such places on maps as a public service.</p>
<p>The Volunteer Forest Service was founded to locate and keep people safe from these living places, and to determine the extent of their powers and origins. While much remains unknown due to the world's lack of a solid understanding of Druidic magic, what is known is there is a process by which a practitioner of nature magic can transform themselves. This transformation creates these genius loci.</p>
<p>The druid sacrifice their life force and soul in an unknown ritual, and a biome of some varity, be it fitting with the surrounding nature or differing, forms from their corpse over the next spring and summer. This location is in truth a single organism, one which is very much undead no matter how it appears.</p>
<p>Little is known about the extent of a genius loci's powers, as each appears to be entirely unique aside from being an undead biome formed from the corpse of a nature worshiper, and granted intelligence by the infusion of their mind and soul. What is known is that while an individual part of one can be overcome through physical force, the Genius Loci will heal over time. Even if burned down, filled in, or otherwise wholly destroyed, the Genius Loci will return in time, surplanting and incorporating anything which might have been built over its location. It is by such assimilation at a Genius Loci grows.</p>
<p>There is no known means of permanently destroying a Genius Loci, save for those occurring within Lin Forest. In which case, the Goddess Tol merely must be informed of the Genius Loci's existence, and she will, for lack of a more clear and understandable term, delete it with mild bemusement.</p>

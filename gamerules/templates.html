<p>A template is a set of rules that you apply to a monster to transform it into a different monster. All templates give precise directions on how to change a monster’s statistics to transform it into the new monster. Some Templates are marked with the letter nashi "<i>Ⱀ</i>" can also be applied to a player or NPC. Some templates can/are applied to items. These templates are marked with the letter khei "<i>Ⳳ</i>".</p>
<p>There are three kinds of templates, Acquired, Inherited, and Simple. Acquired templates can be added to a creature after its birth or creation. Inherited templates are part of a creature from the beginning of its existence, and cannot be given to a creature after birth/creation. Simple templates are designed to be applied on the fly during a game session to augment creatures as needed.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Acquired">Acquired Templates</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">

  <h5 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Undead">Ⱀ Reanimated (CR +1)</span></h5>
  <p>Reanimated is a template which can be applied to any creature, including PCs, which have died and been reanimated rather than resurrected. This creates an undead creature. Any undead monster in Eyom possesses these abilities in addition to any other power it may have.</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
    <p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Base creature’s CR +1.</p>
    <p><b>Alignment:</b> Intelligent undead retain their alignment from life. Mindless undead are True Neutral.</p>
    <p><b>Type:</b> The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). Hit Dice is reduced to a d6. Do not reduce the base attack bonus, or saves.</p>
    <p><b>Senses:</b> Reanimated creatures can detect the bioelectric signals present within living creatures. This is their primary sense, even if they have eyes. It functions as Blindsense with a 60 foot radius, though barriers such as walls (but not foliage) obstruct their vision.</p>
    <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> A Reanimated Creature is subject to all effects which target undead. They become damaged by healing and other positive energy sources, and are healed by negative energy. Resurrection spells cast on a Reanimated Creature are treated as if the creature was struck by a Finger of Death spell and will permanently destroy the Reanimated if they are reduced to 0 HP by the effect.</p>
    <p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> A Reanimated undead retains all of the base creature’s defensive abilities, but also gains damage reduction 5/—, as its dead flesh is difficult to damage. If the base creature had 11 or more Hit Dice, it instead gains damage reduction 10/—. As an undead creature, a Reanimated undead gains all of the immunities and defensive abilities granted by the undead type. They also gain the following ability:</p>
    <p class="disiease" style="margin-left: 3%;"><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 3%;">Reanimated undead slowly regenerate their bodies until their body is in the same condition it was in when they were reanimated. If the Reanimated was animated with one or more organs in a functional state, that organ will continue to function in spite of being dead, and the Reanimated will always regain the use of that organ, even growing a new replacement organ if it is removed. Due to this, unless a Reanimated undead’s body is completely destroyed (either by reducing it via damage to a negative hit point total equal to its normal hit point maximum, burning the corpse, or via an effect like disintegrate), it rises again after 24 hours have passed. When it rises, it does so with a number of hit points equal to its total Hit Dice. </p>
    <p><b>Ability Score Modifiers:</b> Reanimaged lack a Constitution Score. Any points in Constitution are lost when the Reanimated creature is animated. Reanimated are raised with 2 fewer points in each ability score than when they were alive. Mindless Reanimated lack an intelligence score entirely, and have the points from their intelligence split as evenly as possible between STR, DEX, WIS, and CHA.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Inherited">Inherited Templates</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">

<h5 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Waer-ûl">Ⱀ Waer-ûl (CR+1)</span></h5>
<p>Waer-ûl is a template which can be applied to any intelegent coporial creature. Waer-ûl are Eyom's lycanthropes. They are rare, but do have their own small culture, and a shared history lasting a few centuries. The in-univerce lore can be found on the <a href="../misc/Waer-ûl.html">Waer-ûl page</a>. They are exclusivly born with their powers, as their curse cannot be passed between living individuals. Only one parent needs to be a Waer-ûl for their children to inherit this template. If both parents are Waer-ûl, no further benifit is gained.</p>
<p><b>Creating a Waer-ûl:</b> A Waer-ûl recieves all of the following:</p>
<p><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as base creature or base animal (whichever is higher) +1. PLayers may take this template, in which case GMs should adjust combat balance accordingly.</p>
<p><b>Size and Type:</b> The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) gains the shapechanger subtype. Their size catagory remains the same durring this transformation.</p>
<p><b>Senses:</b> Waer-ûl gain sent and low-light vision if they do not have them.</p>
<p><b>Defensive Abilities:</b> Waer-ûl gain DR 10/silver while in hybrid form.</p>
<p><b>Natural Weapons:</b> Waer-ûl have a 1d4 bite attack which deals 1d4 bleed, and two 1d6 claw attacks. These are primary natural attacks.</p>
<p><b>Special Aabilities:</b> A Waer-ûl gains the following special abilities:</p>
<p class="disiease" style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;"><b>Change Shape (Su)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">All Waer-ûl have two forms—a base form and a hybrid form. Their hybrid form is that of a humanoid with the characteristics of a type of canine (usualy wolves, but jackals, cyotes, and all other wild dog species can be found). This includes a coat of fur, canine-shaped head, digitigrade legs, clawed hands and paws, a tail, a wild mane of hair, and an exceptionaly toned and muscular build. A Waer-ûl can shift between forms as a move action. Equipment does not meld with the Waer-ûl when they change forms. If their worn equipment (ie armor, clothing, slotted magic items) is not modified to change shape with them (+20% cost, or a DC 13 Craft check), it gains the broken quality (Adverted if their base form is the same size and build as their hybrid form (15% chance).). A Waer-ûl may shed their equipped clothing as a full round action.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">Waer-ûl can change their form at will, and remain in either form for as long as they please. Spells which revert shapeshifters to their normal form instead force Waer-ûl into the form they personaly pefer spending their time in. Likewise spells which reveal shapeshifters by showing their true form show a Waer-ûl in that same perfered form, though the spell's caster is aware of what they are.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">On nights when the full, skull, or blood moon is visible, a Waer-ûl is forced inot their hybrid form, cannot sleep nor be made to sleep with magic, and is generaly grumpy and irritable. A Waer-ûl reverts to its humanoid form automatically with the next sunrise. A slain Waer-ûl remains in the form they were in when they died.</p>
<p class="disiease" style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;"><b>Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">In any form, Waer-ûl can communicate and empathize with all canines, sheep, cows, and any otehr animal traditionaly herded using dogs in a given region. This communication is functionaly equivilent to speech with a small child. They can use Diplomacy to alter such an animal’s attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 racial bonus on the check.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> While in their normal form, Waer-ûl take 1.5x damage from alchemicaly silvered weapons.</p>
</div>



<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Simple">Simple Templates</span></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">

  <h5 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Toxic">Ⳳ Toxic (CR +1)</span></h5>
  <p>A toxic creature or item has acquired one or more distinct traits such as color, texture, oder, or visible infection which clearly convey it is rotting, poisonous, toxic or otherwise unfit for consumption.</p>
  <p><b>Creating a Toxic Creature/Item:</b> A toxic creature/item has two effects, one activating on contact with a living organism, and another if it is consumed. If a toxic creature/item is touched for a prolonged period (more than one combat round, such as if grappled, picked up/moved, pinned, etc) the creature touching it is subjected to the following poison effect:</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;"><b>Type</b> poison (touch); <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 18; <b>Onset</b> 1 day; <b>Frequency</b> 1/day; <b>Cure</b> 2 consecutive saves</p>
    <p class="disiease" style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;"><b>Effect</b>1 Con drain</p>
  <p>If consumed, either in whole or in part, the creature which has consumed the toxic creature/item is subjected to the following poison effect:</p>
  <p class="disiease" style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;"><b>Type</b> poison (ingested); <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 22; <b>Onset</b> 45 minutes; <b>Frequency</b> 1/hour; <b>Cure</b> 2 consecutive saves <b>Effect</b>1d3 Con drain</p>

    <hr>

  <h5 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Robbert">Ⳳ Robbert Cooked</span></h5>
  <p>Robbert Cooked is a template which can be applied to any cooked dish, food item, or any other substance which is intended to be consumed as food that requires more effort than putting separate ingredients into a bowl (ie: More complex than cereal). The dish will appear to be fully cooked, but alien and wrong even to the eyes of people who have never seen a dish of that type before.</p>
  <p><b>Creating a Robbert Cooked Item:</b> A Robbert Cooked dish applies the following the following disease effect, even if otherwise immune to disease (<i>Note:</i> Goblins instinctively know if a dish is Robbert Cooked.) to anything living or dead which consumes it:</p>



  <div style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">
  <p class="disiease"><b>Rapid Onset Organ Failure</b></p>
  <p>Terrifying and logic defying toxins, trace compounds, and bacterial cultures which would ordinarily not have been present in cooked food, were present in this food due to some sort of horrifying cosmic accident. These elements combine into a lethal miasma of foulness the likes of which drive seasoned medical professionals to drink.

  These elements make their way to the liver, kidneys, and digestive tract, where they disrupt the homeostasis of these organs, causing the onset of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), even in perfectly healthy individuals. Death is inevitable without medical intervention or a miracle.</p>
  <p><b>Type</b> disease, ingested; <b>Save</b> Fortitude DC 30; <b>Frequency</b> 1/hour; <b>Effect</b> –2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Fortitude saves for 1 day (Stacks, extending duration and increasing penalty); <b>Cure</b> magic or 5 successful DC 35 Heal checks made with access to medical equipment, one check per hour.</p>

  <p class="disiease"><b>STAGES</b></p>

  <p>Digestive Discomfort</p>
  <p>The afflicted feels queasy, as if something they ate didn't quite sit right. It doesn't feel serious, merely as if something was poorly cooked. Most believe the sensation will pass shortly.</p>

  <p class="disiease">EMERGENCY PURGE</p>

  <p>The afflicted's body realizes something has gone horribly wrong and attempts to eject the deadly toxins by any means possible. The afflicted gains the Nauseated condition for the next hour as they experience bouts of diarrhea, vomiting, and excessive urination.</p>

  <p class="disiease">Early</p>

  <p>The afflicted feels moderatly fine, though this is only due to the brewing disease charging up a Spirit Bomb of suffering.</p>
  <p>Whenever the afflicted takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it takes 1d6 additional points of nonlethal damage.</p>

  <p class="disiease">Moderate</p>

  <p>The afflicted begins to feel as if worms are writhing and moving beneath its skin. The afflicted creature is constantly sickened. Furthermore, whenever it takes more than a single standard or move action in a round, they become nauseated for 1d4 rounds afterward. Finally, magical healing only exacerbates the problem, and whenever the affected creature is the target of a spell or consumes a potion with the healing subschool, they take 2 points of Constitution damage.</p>

  <p class="disiease">Severe</p>

  <p>The afflicted starts to have "fits" as their organs begin to fail, playing havoc with their nervous system to cause all kinds of horrifying effects. Every minute the afflicted has a 30% chance to experience 1d3 minutes of the following effects simultaneously:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Difficulty breathing.</li>
    <li>Burning of the mouth and throat.</li>
    <li>Eye pain.</li>
    <li>Bloody urine.</li>
    <li>Extreme abdominal pain.</li>
    <li>Nausea.</li>
    <li>Vomiting.</li>
    <li>Diarrhea.</li>
    <li>Convulsions.</li>
    <li>Hypersensitivity to light, sound, odors, and tactile sensations.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Anyone within 30 feet of the afflicted takes a -5 moral penalty to all d20 roles and gains the frightened condition for 1d6 minutes (DC 15 will negates).</p>

  <p class="disiease">Terminal</p>

  <p>If the afflicted fails a saving throw against the disease’s progress at this stage, it dies. Even if it succeeds, it takes 10d10 points of damage and 2 points of Constitution damage, in addition to the disease’s normal effects.</p>
  <p class="disiease">Undeath</p>
  <p>Creatures which die of this disease rise as a vengeful ghost (Under GM control) that haunts whoever prepared the dish that killed them. Their ghost will work to drive them to suicide, ruin, or both.</p>

  <h5 class="articlesubtitle"><span id="Bandit">Bandit</span></h5>
  <p>Bandits in Eyom are hearty folk who either live or spend extended time in the wilderness while also engaging in an extremely risky profession which puts them in constant danger. They are extremely hearty, tough, and dangerous individuals. More so than most.</p>
  <p>To create an Eyomic Bandit, take whatever stats you are using for and apply the following:</p>
  <p>Quick Augment:<b></b> +2 on all rolls (including damage rolls) and special ability DCs; +4 to AC and CMD; +4 hp/HD.</p>
  <p><b>Skills:</b> Bandits gain a +5 experiance bonus to Stealth and Perception. Additionaly, they may move at full speed (but not run) while using stealth without any penalties.</p>
  <p><b>Special Abilities:</b> Eyomic Bandits gain the following Special Abilities:</p>
  <p class="disiease" style="margin-left: 3%;"><b>Ambush Training</b></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 3%;">As a swift action, you can draw upon crude but effective hedge magic to bend light around you and blend into your surroundings. While under the effect of this power, you gain concealment from creatures more than 10 feet away (attacks have a 20% miss chance), and total concealment from creatures more than 40 feet away (attacks have a 50% miss chance). You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 3%;">You also gain the following spell-like abilities usable once per day.</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 6%;">
    <li><i>1st — <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alarm/">alarm</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/expeditious-construction">Expeditious Construction</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/expeditious-excavation">Expeditious Excavation</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/o/obscuring-mist">Obscuring Mist</a> </i></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="disiease" style="margin-left: 3%;"><b>Bandit Conditioning (Ex)</b></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 3%;">A number of times per day equal to your Constitution, as a swift action you may convert any lethal damage to non-lethal damage. Additionally when you would be knocked unconscious by any effect, or by gaining non-lethal damage, you instead remain conscious for a number of rounds equal to your CON + 1/2 CR. During these rounds you may only make a single action per round, accepting full round actions which allow for movement such as the run action, or casting spells with a full round action casting time that would permit an escape.</p>

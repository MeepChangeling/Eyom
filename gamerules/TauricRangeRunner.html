<p>For many Tauric folk, the thrill of chasing down a foe in battle is too great to ignore entirely. For those same people, they have accepted the simple truth that against many foes, range is key. Of course, for a few targets, particularly some of the nastier things one can find in the darker, more remote, usually smelly corners of Eyom's wilds, you just gotta run up and hit it with a big stick.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/more-races/monstrous-races-21-30-rp/centaur">Centaur</a> (or any tauric creature at the GM&rsquo;s discretion).</p>
<p><strong>Class Skills</strong>: A charger gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge">Knowledge</a> (nature), and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival">Survival</a> as class skills, but does not gain <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb">Climb</a>, <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal">Handle Animal</a>, or <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride">Ride</a> as class skills.</p>
<p>This alters the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier">cavalier&rsquo;s</a> class skills.</p>
<p class="head">Weapon and Armor Proficiency</span></p>
<p>A charger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as firearms, with light and medium <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, and with shields (except tower shields). A charger&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier">cavalier</a> levels stack with any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighter</a> levels he possesses for the purpose of meeting the level prerequisite for feats that can specify a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/lance">lance</a>, such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-specialization-combat">Weapon Specialization</a>.</p>
<p>This replaces the cavalier&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.</p>
<p class="head">Natural Mount (Ex)</span></p>
<p>A charger counts as having the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/mounted-combat-combat">Mounted Combat</a> feat only for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and substitutes the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> skill for any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride">Ride</a> skill prerequisites when acquiring feats that have <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/mounted-combat-combat">Mounted Combat</a> as a prerequisite. Because of his equine form, a charger can wield a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/lance">lance</a> one-handed as if mounted and deals double damage with a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/lance">lance</a> while charging. A charger can never gain the benefit of the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/mounted-combat-combat">Mounted Combat</a> feat (or other similar feats or effects, such as <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/trick-riding-combat">Trick Riding</a>) if ridden by another creature.</p>
<p>This ability replaces mount.</p>
<p class="head">Quadathalon (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>At 3rd level, a charger gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/shot-on-the-run-combat/">Shot on the Run</a> as a bonus feat.</p>
<p>This ability replaces cavalier&rsquo;s charge.</p>
<p class="head">Courser (Ex)</span></h4>
<p>At 4th level, a charger&rsquo;s constant training increases his land speed by 10 feet. A charger can also move through up to 10 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. These benefits apply only when he is wearing no <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, light <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, or medium <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus">armor</a>, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the charger&rsquo;s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. These bonuses stack with any other bonuses to the charger&rsquo;s land speed or ability to ignore difficult terrain.</p>
<p>This ability replaces expert trainer.</p>
<p class="head">Ride Down (Ex)</span></p>
<p>At 11th level, a charger can attempt to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> any number of targets in the path of his charge as a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions">free action</a>. For each successful <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> check, the charger automatically deals an amount of damage to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> target equal to that of his hoof attack and can continue with his charge. If any <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> attempt fails during the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge">charge</a>, the charger&rsquo;s progress ends in the space directly in front of the target where the maneuver failed. These <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> attempts do not provoke <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity">attacks of opportunity</a>. For each target in the path of his charge, the charger incurs a cumulative &ndash;2 penalty on his <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun">overrun</a> <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers">combat maneuver</a> checks.</p>
<p>This ability replaces mighty charge.</p>

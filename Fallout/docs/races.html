        <h1>Races & Species</h1>
    	<p>The world the Great War ended was a world humanity ruled as the soul sapient species. After the bombs fell bringing radiation and FEV contamination to Earth, humanity found itself slowly starting to share its world with other intelligent lifeforms. In the modern era, there are a number of species capable of developing culture, civilization, art, tools, and all other hallmarks of intelligent life.</p>
    	<p>These lists are presented in order from most to least common.</p>
    	<h2>Humans and the Human Family</h2>
    	<p>In ancient times, before the dawn of civilization, the human race was composed of several species. <i>Homo sapiens</i> lived alongside <em>Homo <a title="Neanderthal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal">Neanderthals</a>,</em> <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="H. naledi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._naledi">H.&nbsp;naledi</a></em>, <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="H. ergaster" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._ergaster">H.&nbsp;ergaster</a></em>, <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="H. antecessor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._antecessor">H.&nbsp;antecessor</a></em>, and <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="H. habilis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._habilis">H.&nbsp;habilis</a></em>.</p>
    	<p>Over the last two centuries, several new human subspecies and stable mutations have emerged. These are the ones accepted by humans into their family. The ones people will glare at you for calling them mutants outside of academic forums. In other words, these are the groups largely considered to be races rather than species.</p>
    	<ul>
      	<li><b><a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Human">Humans</a>:</b> Your typical wasteland human. Less fertile, shorter lived, and more prone to genetic defects than pre-war humans, but generally the same as their ancestors.<br>

(IE You can stand in front of an exposed fusion reactor and be fine, but sticking your hand into the corona will still destroy your hand. You can also be killed by the laser pistol the reactor's guard is shooting at you.)</p>

          	<p>You require double the normal dose of a chem to gain its benefits.

You are capable of lifting and throwing objects as large as a standard car. Thanks to your keen senses, you reduce the difficulty of all PER tests by 1 to a minimum of 0. You may also detect creatures or objects that characters normally cannot.</p>
          	<p>Your INT maximum is lowered to 5. Due to your immense size, your Defense is locked to being 1. You can also only wear armor that has been made to fit a Deathclaw. You may not have more than 3 ranks in any Skill unless otherwise stated previously. You cannot tag the Big Guns, Energy Weapons, or Small Guns skills nor allocate ranks to them. If you are not adequately disguised (such as wearing a loose robe), Humans will more than likely shoot you on sight or go running screaming in the opposite direction.</p>
          	<p>Your torso is considered to be a weak spot. If an attacker chooses to target your torso specifically (i.e. not targeted due to random chance) then their damage ignores your natural Damage Resistance.</p>
          	<p>You also choose one of the two traits below.</p>
          	<p style="font-weight: bold;">Trait: Brawn!</p>
          	<p>Your Melee Bonus Damage is considered to be one category higher (i.e. if you have Strength of 7-8, your bonus is +2 rather than +1) Your tough hide grants 3 natural Damage Resistance (All).</p>
          	<p>You cannot have any ranks in Lockpick, Medicine, Pilot, Repair, or Science due to having inhuman claws for hands that you only know how to use for slashing/mauling. This can be negated by taking the Nimble Claws perk.</p>

    	<h2>Robots</h2>
    	<p>While not possible for all thinking machines, some of them, depending on their hardware, operational time, and environmental conditions, are able to exceed the limits of their programming and "evolve" for lack of a better term. These machines do not appear much different from their run-of-the-mill brethren at first, but in time they develop opinions, a range of emotions, and a web of desires almost if not just as complex as any human's.</p>
    	<p>While many see such machines as merely malfunctioning in a strange way, others insist they are people. Notably, all machines existing in this fashion will, eventually, call themselves a person. In a world populated by giant green men created by dipping a human in glowing ooze, whose to say a rock tricked into thinking can't achieve true consciousness? Besides, some things thought of as robots are objectively people...</p>

While technically speaking a cyborg the wasteland classifies them as robots due to their accepting programming just like any compter and having no trace of the original person left within their organic parts. Of course, it's no supprise to anyone who sees the brian under their clear domes when Robobrains suddenly wake up one day. Most self-aware Robobrains quickly find a way to die. Those who are not driven to suicide by their existance tend to be a little jaded, bitter, and hostile, but are often some of the most intelligent and skilled individuals for scientific and technical persuits.<br>

          	<p>You have computer enhanced vision and improved sensory systems that can detect smells, chemicals, and radiation, reducing the difficulty of Perception tests that rely on sight and smell by 1. You can also see Ultra Violet and INfrared light, allowing you to detect temperature at range and see in the dark. You are also immune to radiation and poison damage, but you cannot use chems, nor can you benefit from food, drink, or rest. You move via tracks, which makes movement over difficult terrain such as rubble, stairs, extremely pot-holled roads, and similar rapid elevation adjustments twice as difficult. Your carry weight is 150 lbs., and it cannot be increased by your Strength or perks, but it can be increased by modified armor. You cannot recover from your own injuries or heal health points without receiving repairs.</p>
          	<p>You are also the victim of extreme cruelty and inhumane scientific experimentation. You have a combination of programmed orders and extreme trauma. You must discuss with your GM how this aspect of your character manifests and stick to it for the lifetime of the caracter, which can be forever. It is possible to receive mental healthcare to help counteract these traits, but can never fully cure them (At least without further help from a roboticist and decades of therapy).</p>

    	<h2>Extra Terrestrial Lifeforms</h2>
    	<p>While typically believed to be the ravings of madmen, post-war Earth appears to be inhabited by a small number of alien lifeforms. There are too many accounts and settings by credible, trustworthy, and even heroic individuals to dismiss the claims as pure nonsense. What's more, archeologists and scholars have been aware of certain pre-war advances in technology being credited to alien technology by the US Government. AI and plasma weapons in particular have clear ties to the study of technology discovered in crashed vessels, or at least, so the terminals say...</p>

They've been seen in the area for hundreds of years, off and on, but only at night. Interestingly enough they are not inherently hostile to humans and mutants, only attacking in self defense. They are said to occasionally abduct people, though they do seem to return everyone they take after some time. While there are not documented instances of them speaking to humans, anything riding around on a jet pack in an environmental suit, studying plants, animals, and structures is absolutely a person.<br>

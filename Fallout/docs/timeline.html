      <h1>Timeline</h1>
    	<p>Fallout: Revitalized takes place in an alternate timeline from the Canon Fallout. This is to allow creative freedom for its creators in order to create a better Tabletop Roleplaying Game experience. The more freedom a TTRPG can offer players, the better. Hence, Fallout: Revitalized has elected to count certain events as canon which Bethesda has not, decanonized some of Bethesda's changes, and create some new lore atop these changes.</p>
    	<p>The idea is to smooth out the rough transition occurring in the lore due to Interplay's death, allow for some things Interplay couldn't show/do due to time/money to have occurred, and most importantly, make the actions of player characters matter by allowing the world to change for the better... or the worse, depending on what kind of person the players choose to be.</p>
    	<p>To allow GMs to understand what is added and what is changed, items marked with a ⚙ are changes to base cannon, while items marked with a ★ are additions. Items marked with ☢ are events from non-canon or canceled sources which Fallout: Revitalized considers canon.</p>

The central control facility of the network <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_0">Vault 0</a> is compleated, and a cybernetic intelligence dubbed <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Calculator">The Calculator</a> is created to manage the facility. The facility is truly impressive, including terraforming technology, robot production facilities, and even cryonic-suspension chambers to allow VIPs to ride out a disaster and rebuilding efforts. However, the construction of Vault 0 and the Calculator push the project too far over budget. The Government sells Project Safehouse to Vault-Tec, and Vault 0 is largly mothballed though left in an active state to serve as a presidential bunker.</li>

The project is codenamed "Chimera" and its FEV strain is dubbed "Echidna" (AKA FEV-E) after the mother of the Chimera from greek mythology. Project Chimera is granted the use of a remote laboratory in Halletsville, TX. The lab is fitted with a nuclear warhead to use as a self destruct incase of a containment breach. At Dr. Robertson's request, the warhead is modified into a shaped charge so the blast will be directed upwards, destroying the lab but allowing anyone who escaped to survive the blast on the surface.</li>

Additionally, the strain proves to be capable of taking DNA from one species and using it as the base for its mutations within a second species <i>(IE, if a dog ate a rabbit mutated by FEV-E, the dog's resulting mutations would be based on the rabbit's DNA.)</i>. As little as 0.03 cubic centimeters proves to be sufficient to cause mutation within hours. Several researchers quit the project citing safety concerns.</li>

Most of the missile interceptors are destroyed by the short range munitions of Chinese subs int he gulf of Mexico, who then turn their remaining weapons on the Space Center. The Space Center itself is saved due to experimental laser based misscile countermeasures which had been designed to ensure wayward rockets could be destroyed before they could pose any danger to Houston.</li>
        	<li class="ad">The USS Dallas under the command of Captain Ramirez engages stealthed Chinese submarines off the coast of Houstin. After depleting their munitions, Captain Ramirez elects to ram the final Chinese vessel, destroying it before it could fire a high-yield nuclear warhead into the heart of Houston. Both vessels sink to the sea bed a short distance from the Sea-Tec facility.

They become so beloved by the survivors as well as Austin and its robots that they are asked to stay in town. The Botanicals decide they should stick closer to town given the circumstances and move into the surprisingly intact St. Edwards Park.

        	<li class="ad">Isolated, without food, and without water, the communist rebels in the metros turn to cannibalism, but only once. The trauma of the event is so great they go mad. They come to believe that humanity is fundamentally evil and God willed humanity's end in Atomic Fire. They are eventually rescued by remnants of the Houston fire department, who they promptly kill.

In exchange for food, the Sea-Tec scientists tell the reenactors about their ocean facility, remarking it should be safe for long term habitation in a few months once the fule spill settles out and offering to set them all up within the facility if they keep them safe and fed. The reinactors agree.</li>

They set the self destruct and depart into the wasteland. The shaped nuclear charge blows the FEV-E into the atmosphere, failing to boil the liquid as it vaporises, and thereby contaminating a large region of the Texas Badlands. Mutations set in within weeks, leading to locals starting to call the area "a land of monsters".</li>

The group decides to wait for conditions on the surface to improve and use their technology to found a new nation, taking on the name "The Gulf Coast Confederacy" since the CSA side had won the Battle of Palmito Ranch, and they planed on establishing their nation as a confederation.</li>
        	<li class="ad">Surviving scientists within the Johnson Space Center are able to re-purpose the Center's anti-rocket laser array into an anti-infantry array to protect themselves from raiders. After some debate they decide to attempt to contact the US's various space stations in the hopes of retrieving the astronauts. They are unsuccessful, but come to realize that some of the only uncontaminated seeds in the world will be those stored on various space stations for scientific experiments. They begin plans to attempt a retrieval, but without external supplies calculate they will be unable to reach space for several generations. A vow is made to not only retrieve the uncontaminated seeds, but return humanity to the stars. Locals take to calling the NASA personnel the "Space Pioneers" in a joking fashion.</li>

Austin has no problem with its citizens having factions and deciding the rules and laws of their "Neighborhoods", but does promise it will intervene to stop violence within the city. Which it does, swiftly and brutally. Often by having its robots carry aggressors outside of the city limits to "take it outside". As a result, Austin becomes a location known as a neutral ground where members of all kinds of groups intermingle, share ideas, and otherwise cohabitate.</li>

To the supprise of everyone of both species, a small number of the younger generation paires off as couples. This minority is treated a bit negatively, but not overly so as most people can understand how humans and claws who see no cultural differences between them might share some feelings for eachother. Other NCR groups learn of this and are outraged, but are eventually quieted by a speech from the NCR's president reminding the members that each state in the republic is entitled to live under its own ways, provided they keep to their shared laws. The Tribe Elders do not like the negative attention the young have brought their tribe and attempt to encourage the couples to separate. This is met with extreme backlash from the entire younger generation, such that the elders abandon their attempts.</li>

The children are examined and it is discovered that the adaptation mutations spread to humans in 2232 by Dr. Boyarsky interact with an uncommon FEV mutation found in some deathclaws, allowing the species to hybridize. The hybrid children appear to be healthy, and blend the features of the intelligent deathclaws with those of humans. Their existence causes more outrage in the same NCR groups which objected previously, but removes all animosity from the Tribe of Goris, who take the hybrid children as a sign from the gods that their species are meant to coexist.</li>

Defeated, they take the chip to Mr. House, who fortunately survived the strike along with the western half of the Mojave.

The NCR's scientific community is fascinated by what they believe to be the first successful recombination between FEV mutants, enough for them to get the NCR to grant the children and their families protection from the groups which continue to see them as abominations. Events come to a head when a terrorist attempts to firebomb a school the hybrids attend, killing many ordinary human children in the process. The general public is outraged and begin to riot, demanding the government do something to protect its citizens from extremist groups. The NCR responds by creating a group of specialized police called Street Sentinels, who are authorized to deal with violence and potential terrorism with extreme force. More peaceful solutions are also implemented, including the standardization of "Mutant History and Rights" courses in NCR schools.</li>

She rather dislikes their vaguely evil largely inconsiderate ways, but knows that as the director she can steer them down the right path. With a little bit of diplomacy, a few 10mm rounds provided by her wife Ada, and help from her loyal army of Synths, Nora takes over the Institute not only as Director, but as Queen of the Commonwealth. As the region's absolute monarch, she begins to return life to the wasteland.

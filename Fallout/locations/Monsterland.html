          <p>Monsterland is the most infamous zone within the Texas Badlands. Its name is almost as old as the Great War itself, and comes from what the people who live near it called it. It truly is a land of monsters, as it is nearly overrun by mutants of all kinds. This includes mutant humans who have retained most if not all of their intelligence, who make up the entire sapient population of the zone as their mutant abilities are key to surviving in Monsterland.</p>
          <p>The zone is best physically described as a network of river valleys breaking up the flatlands south and west of Houston. Monsterland is vast and expansive, easily the size of Houston and the Bayou combined. These two facts combine to create a labyrinth of navigable waterways, flood carved canyons, and rolling hills.</p>
          <p>These valleys and hills are largely arable farmland, most of which are impossible to farm due to the monsters occupying the territories. Fortunately for the mutant outcasts living in the zone, control over even a single valley is more than enough to keep one’s tribe well fed. Controlling several would allow for exports and even starting a small farm-based kingdom of one’s own… If Outlanders would willingly eat anything that grew in the mutagen contaminated soil.</p>
          <p>The many tubes inhabiting the region are daily primitive. Not by choice, but due to lacking trade networks and little in terms of value to be scavenged within the zone. Consequently they have formed small tribal civilizations who work with stone, wood, and occasionally iron. They are known to erect elaborate tone structures, and carve their villages into the sides of their valley or canyon homes.</p>
          <p>They’ve also constructed many ziggurats, each one dedicated to one of their gods. Little information is known about the tribe’s religion (or religions as the case may be), but they do appear to sacrifice creatures atop their temples.</p>
          <p>As Mosnterland is covered in thick shrubs and clumps of old gnarled trees, there is one export the three largest tribes are able to export as the Badland’s other residents believe it to be safe to handle and use. Charcoal. Fire is a valid solution to FEV contamination after all, and charcoal is made by burning wood. The trade is naturally unfair, with the tribes being under paid for their labors, but it does allow them to acquire some of the education and equipment they need for their studies.</p>

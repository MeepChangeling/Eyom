          <figure class="right" style="margin-top: 0; overflow: hidden; width: 40%; height: 60%;"><iframe src="../../maps/FalloutHoustinMap.html#29.81172/-95.62854/11.694976925244063z" style="z-index: 100%" width="99%" height="92%"></iframe><figcaption>Central Houston</figcaption></figure>
          <p>Central Houston, also known as Downtown Houston, is the former heart of the ex-metropolis. The ghost of Houston is most evident here, taking the form of the iconic buildings and landmarks that once made Houston a hub of commerce and culture, including the Houston City Hall, Minute Maid Park, and the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Many of these structures still stand, preserved as best they can by wasters who use them as their homes, or who preserve them out of some sense of honor and duty to their ancestors.</p>
          <p>The Zone is heavily populated by various small waster factions, such as the Kingdom of Katy (Who operate extensively in the area despite being based in Western Houston), the Downtown Destroyers, and the Houston Survivalists. It sees activity from every major faction in the badlands as well, and even has an outposts of the Texas chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel.</p>
          <p>As a somewhat thriving civilized area, the zone is mostly defined by cultural means. The official border between Central and Western Houston is the TX 99 Toll Road, a place chosen by treaty after a long series of Gang Wars in the early days of the Wasteland. In the modern era, this border stands, with no faction claiming territory on the opposing side of the road without permission, but people freely coming and going as they please.</p>
          <p>The wasters in Central Houston are scrappier and more resourceful than most, and they've managed to eke out a living in the ruins of the city. However, the constant fighting between the countless small factions has made Central Houston a very dangerous place to live. There are centuries of landmines, IEDs, and other boobytrapps scattered everywhere, either long forgotten by their owners or placed long ago by dead men. This is to say nothing of the active gang wars which plague small parts of the zone and change daily.</p>
          <p>Central Houston is largely lawless, just like the majority of Wastelands back in the day. A callback to the old ways of living. Many people seek it out for that reason as they are simply unable to cope with the changing world and easier survival than they knew in their youth. Others avoid it for the same reason.</p>
          <p>Itâ€™s worth noting that Central Houston is home to Bear Creek Pioneer Park, a rare oasis of greenery in the otherwise desolate remains of Houston. It contains several hiking trails and campsites, making it a popular destination for travelers passing through the area. However, it is also a target for raiders looking to take advantage of the park's resources and any unsuspecting travelers who happen upon it.</p>

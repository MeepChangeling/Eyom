          <p>Western Houston is often simply called “Houston” by people all across post-war America. Its the most civilized region of the old city, and is largely occupied by the small Kingdom of Katy (aka Katyland), who rules over the other settlements in the zone in a simple feudal arrangement. While the kingdom is not recognised by major powers such as the NCR, Attis’ Kingdom, or the Republic of Texas as it cannot project power out of the Badlands (or even all that far from Katyland) it remains the most powerful governing body within Houston.</p>
          <p>Its been a safe and prosperous area for a long time, despite its many border conflicts and gang wars against groups from Central Houston. This relative peace, stability, and prosperity has allowed Western Houston to become a hub for travelers and traders, not just within the Badlands, but for anyone looking to trade with or explore the Houston Area. Its home to many bustling bazaars, a functional mall, and plenty of hotels for travelers to stay in, be it over night or long term.</p>
          <p>Western houston is simply defined by what parts of the old city are left once the other zones were established. Here you can find the old John Paul Landing Park, located on the Brazos River, a popular destination for fishermen and boaters. The Houston Executive Airport, located in the northern part of the zone, serves as a vital transportation hub for traders and merchants in the region thanks to a few functional helicopters and the Space Pioneers graciously allowing some of their air fleet to be chartered from the airport. The town of Fulshear, located to the south of Katyland, is a bustling trading hub where travelers heading west can stock up on supplies and rest before continuing their journeys. Its even got a resort for those wealthy enough for luxury.</p>
          <p>The zone also contains Highland Park, though it is a dangerous area rife with warring factions and violent gangs. The last holdout of lawlessness within the zone. Its mostly fenced or walled off and patrolled by Katyland’s military forces to ensure the violence doesn't spill out into the surrounding areas.</p>
          <p>The Zone is well known for infrastructure development projects, and if it were not for the Woodlands and the Peninsula would be the most developed part of the Badlands. All in all, third place amongst those with electricity and air conditioning isn’t so bad when most places still have problems keeping drinking water separate from pooping water.</p>

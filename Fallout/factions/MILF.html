        <p>The Mutant Integration and Liberation Front is exactly what the name implies; a guerilla organization run by mutants, to protect mutants. Their primary goal is the integration of mutants with human communities because of their deeply held belief that that mutants are the a new stage of human evolution. In their opinion, mutants have the right to thrive just like any other human group.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the Mutant Integration and Liberation Front, their founder didn’t think about what acronyms the organization’s name might make. The relatively low intellectual capabilities of super mutants prevented the organization’s founders prevented them from thinking about the name’s implications too. The name became cemented after years of operating in the background only for the first non-super mutants to join the Mutant Integration and Liberation Front and giggle because “Haha, MILF.”</p>
        <p>For better or worse, the name has stuck making it hard for some humans to take them seriously. To most of the Badlands, MILF is a bunch of idiots working at a problem they will never solve. The rest take pity on those poor stupid mutants who couldn’t even come up with a good name to call themselves. As for foreigners (or Yankees as the badland’s folk call them), they hear about assume the organization is a group of super mutants who are less hostile than most and would like to live somewhere other than a cave.</p>
        <p>All four viewpoints are true to an extent. The Mutant Integration and Liberation Front is certainly an organization founded by idealistic people who were naive in regards to the mission they had chosen, many of their current members are intellectual challenged due to malformed braintissue, their groups name is quite silly, and they would really like to live somewhere with a bathroom.</p>
        <p>The Front was started by a group of Nightkin who fled the Master’s army the Front fights for the rights and acceptance of all mutants capable of speech or otherwise able to communicate.</p>
        <p>Their admittedly broad definition of intelligent life includes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li aria-level="1">All FEV Mutants, supermutants or otherwise who are capable of speech or otherwise communicating complex thoughts.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">All radiation based Mutants who are capable of speech or otherwise communicating complex thoughts.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Robots and artificial intelligences capable of acting beyond their programming.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Ordinary humans with notable physical or mental deviation from the human norm (IE Autism, down syndrome, cleft palates, six fingers, etc).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Their definition being inclusive as it is is the result of super mutant thinking rather than any advanced philosophy or social ideals. When one is simple minded, simple answers are what come to mind. Hence when the Front asked “What is a mutant?” the answer they agreed to was “Anyone who doesn't look or act normal for what they are.” If it can talk and doesn't fit in with its own kind, the Front sees it as a mutant and will happily accept it.</p>
        <p>The MILF is therefor made up of ghouls, super mutants, a few robots, the occasional physically mutated human of the non-super variety, and the odd disabled or socially outcast human who is glad to have a supportive community. The Front also includes a few rare members such as death claws, talking animals, and unmutated humans who empathize with their cause.</p>
        <p>These individuals operate from hidden bases throughout the Badlands, preforming good-will missions for human communities and anything they need to survive. The Front’s missions are enabled by their extremely high level of organization with many cells able to operate independently towards the same task, and their relatively abundant access to advanced technology.</p>
        <p>The Front are some of the best scavengers in the Badlands due to their inhabitation of remote locations few have touched before and mutant durability. The items they have obtained through salvage reflect this. They also retain some equipment, training, and tactics from the Master’s army (which their founders split from), and have equipment they obtained from the battlefield due to being attacked by various BoS chapters fairly often.</p>
        <p>While their goal is to be accepted and integrated into human society, the Front is not afraid to use violence to achieve their ends. They see themselves as engaged in a struggle against the oppressive forces of the wasteland, and are willing to fight to protect their own. They often launch raids on human settlements to rescue captured mutants or steal supplies, and use their advanced technology to disrupt communication and transportation systems of slavers and anti-mutant factions.</p>
        <p>Violence is never their first choice, but it remains on the table at all times. Their primary tactics involve a mix of direct action, propaganda, and community-building. The Front will patrol the area around small settlements to provide protection for the humans, delve into dangerous locations to put an end to the threat, donate food, water, and/or construction materials, and other similar good will missions. They also distribute propaganda to spread their message of mutant empowerment, and work to build alliances with other like-minded groups.</p>
        <p>The Front has won over plenty of small communities, but have yet to make serious inroads with any large settlement. Especially since not all super mutants in the Badlands are members of MILF. Plenty of places are raided by super mutant kind and do not forget, nor care about differences between “greenskin tribes”.</p>
        <p>The Front counters these raids primarily through farming, trade, education, and assistance with construction, maintenance, and security for any community willing to work with mutantkind. They prefer using these good will missions to more violent operations, but get sadly few chances to do so.</p>
        <p>The Mutant Integration Liberation Front has a small but dedicated presence in Houston. They primarily operate in the outskirts of the city, seeking to recruit mutants to their cause and to protect them from persecution by other factions. They are best known within Houston for their hit-and-run attacks on larger, more organized groups of hostile individuals.</p>
        <p>The Houston chapter of the MILF is led by a charismatic super mutant named Big Red, who is highly intelligent and known for his fiery speeches and uncompromising stance on mutant rights. He has a small but loyal following of mutants who see him as a champion of their cause, and who are willing to follow him into battle against anyone who threatens their freedom and autonomy.</p>
        <p>While the MILF is often viewed with suspicion and distrust by other factions in Houston, there are some who sympathize with their cause and see them as a necessary counterbalance to the more powerful and authoritarian groups vying for control over the city. However, the MILF's willingness to use violence to achieve their goals has made them enemies of many of the other factions, who see them as a dangerous and destabilizing force.</p>

        <h1>Organization and Culture</h1>
        <p>The Mutant Integration Liberation Front is a loose collective of mutants who have banded together for mutual protection and support. Unlike other mutant groups, who often segregate themselves from humans or even view them as enemies, the MILF is open to working with non-mutants who share their values. The organization has no official leadership or hierarchy, instead relying on a loose network of trusted individuals who work together to achieve shared goals.</p>
        <p>The average Front cell is composed of a dozen or so individuals who live as an extended family. They maintain contact with other cells in a simple web of “neighbors” via runners, radio, telegraph, terminal links, or whatever method of communication is convenient for a given pair of neighbors. Each cell is tasked with working towards the Front’s goals independently, but required to help their neighbor cells with anything they may need.</p>
        <p>The MILF's culture is defined by its sense of unity and solidarity. Mutants of all kinds are welcome within the group, and there is no discrimination based on mutation type or severity. Members are encouraged to share their experiences and support one another, and the group provides resources and assistance to those in need. The Front also places a strong emphasis on personal autonomy, with members encouraged to make their own decisions and contribute to the group in their own unique ways.</p>
        <p>It is, in practically, a giant clan in the most traditional sense. A loose organization of close knit families helping their friends and neighbors towards mutual goals.</p>

        <h1>Leader</h1>
        <h2>Big Red</h2>
        <figure style="width: 25%; height:auto; float:left;">
          <img width="100%" height="100% "src="../img/BigRed.webp" alt="Big Red">
          <figcaption>Big Red, North Houston Cell Leader</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The closest thing to a tactical, strategic, or operational planner for the Front as a whole is the mutant known as Big Red. He’s a large hulking reddish-skinned super mutant who happens to be blind. Despite this disability Big Red is said to have “sight beyond sight” and does appear to be psychic, forseeing events with high accuracy and quite often.</p>
        <p>Big Red isn’t necessarily gifted. His precognition may simply be an exceptionally keen analytical mind coupled with an unusually high amount of current events knowledge. Yet regardless of how he does it, Big Red is able to plan operations around seemingly any problem. When he gives orders, the mission gets done. That’s enough for the Front to look to him as an advisor even if he isn’t in charge of their cell.</p>
        <p>Big Red’s own accomplishments include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li aria-level="1">Establishing a safe base of operations in Northern Houston with no losses.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Defeating the Gulf Coast Confederacy’s military though guerrilla tactics.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Securing a stable pure water supply in Northern Houston.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">The destruction of a Bayou Raider plantation, liberation of its slaves, securing of its assets, with minimal losses (3 of 30).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These accomplishments alone would be impressive. Big Red’s litany of deeds is lengthy and composed of similar feets. These are his average, not his peek. He is the stuff of legends for the Front, and likely to remain one of their most respected members until his death.</p>
        <p>Untill such time, he is one of the highest priority targets for the Front's enamies. Taking out Big Red would greatly hamper the Front's operations. Primarly in Houston, but also anywhere in the Southern Badlands.</p>

        <h2>Lahrehn</h2>
        <figure style="width: 25%; height:auto; float:right; display:none;">
          <img width="100%" height="100% "src="../img/TheMILFQ.webp" alt="Big Red">
          <figcaption>Lahrehn, Queen of the Front</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>From time to time, the Front has awarded the title <em>Queen of the MILFs</em> to a female member who the Front’s human members insists is “the very definition of a MILF”. Obviously this is a bit of a joke on the Front’s super mutant members who don’t understand how silly the Front’s name is. It’s a well meaning traditional joke, one which the more intelligent super mutants are in on and appreciate. Its simply a little self aware humor meant to bring a smile to those in the know and a means of inspiring those who don’t by making them believe their ideals have a champion.</p>
        <p>At least, it was a joke until 6 years ago when a mutant from the Goblin tribe in Monsterland left that hellscape of FEV chaos and exuded mom energy like U-234 exudes gamma rays. Lahrehn was simply a mother who had lost her children and wandered far from home in search of a new life. She encountered a group of super mutants working with the Front and due to their cognitive issues decided they needed someone to look out for them.</p>
        <p>She became the cell’s mom. Then the region’s mom. Until within a few short years the entire Front knew her name, what she looked like, and had the desire to protect this precious bean. This has given Lahrehn an insane amount of influence and pull within the Front. She’s practically a centralized leader, though she does not behave as such.</p>
        <p>However, if she says something needs to be done, it gets done. Almost every order she’s given has been along the lines of “Brush your teeth!” or “Sweep up when you’re done.” The secret to her influence may simply be all she cares to do with it is make sure everyone is happy, healthy, and not standing around in garbage.</p>
        <p>She has ironically become the Queen of MILF, though the humans in the group have taken to calling her the Queen of the Front since Lahrehn knows what MILF means and takes being called as such quite seriously (And few are attracted to her variety of mutant <em>that</em> way).</p>

        <h1>Headquarters</h1>
        <p>As a decentralized movment, the MILF has no headquarters. They do have some permanant settlments they own and operate, but no leaders will be found in these places. The Front avoids such things. Their cause would only be weakned by a formal government which humans would have to one day intigrate into their communities.</p>

        <h1>Unique Assets</h1>
          <h2>Mutant Enhancement Serum</h2>
            <figure class="left" style="width: 50%; height:auto;">
              <img width="100%" height="100% "src="../img/MEStube.webp" alt="AH-77 in Flight">
              <figcaption>A vial of MES</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Mutant Enhancement Serum is a highly sought-after drug that can enhance the physical and mental abilities of those who consume it. While it effects humans to a notable extent, it is far more effective when used by a mutant. Not only is MES far more effective in mutant hands, but any “abilities” provided by their particular mutation are enhanced as well.</p>
            <p>The effects of MES are sometimes permanent, causing mutation in humans and increasing the “mutation level” of already mutated individuals along their current “path”. For this reason humans often campaign against the drug, as several high profile events where an individual using MES spontaneously mutated and went on a rampage as their brain chemistry was suddenly plunged into chaos have given the drug a reputation as being exceptionally dangerous.</p>
            <p>No such risk exists for mutants, to whom it is a steroid which some times doesn't wear off.</p>
            <p>The exact composition of the serum is a closely guarded secret, known only to a few select individuals and groups who produce it. The Front is one of the two major producers of MES, the other being the United Tribes of Monsterland. Of the two, the Front has access to sanitization, chemistry equipment, and scientific knowledge. The Tribes have mortars, pestals, and baked mud containers.</p>
            <p>It’s not hard to see why people prefer the Front’s products.</p>
            <p>The effects of the serum vary depending on the individual and their specific mutation, but in general, it can increase strength, endurance, speed, and agility. It can also improve cognitive function and sensory perception, making users more alert and aware of their surroundings.</p>
            <p>However, there are also significant risks associated with the use of Mutant Enhancement Serum. The drug can cause serious physical and psychological side effects, including addiction, hallucinations, and organ damage. The long-term effects of the serum on the human body are not fully understood, but it is known to be highly addictive and can lead to permanent changes in the user's physiology.</p>
            <p>Despite the risks, many mutants and wastelanders are willing to take the serum in order to gain an edge in battle or for survival. It is often sold on the black market for exorbitant prices, with some users going to great lengths to obtain it. It is also rumored to be a key component in the operations of the Mutant Integration Liberation Front, who use the drug to enhance the abilities of their members in their fight against oppression and persecution.</p>
            <p>What is indisputable is the Front funds much of their work through selling MES to mutants, but especially ghouls who believe there’s a small chance the drug may allow them to regain some of their lost humanity. There’s even some evidence behind that notion, though no solid proof has emerged.</p>
            <h2>Stealth “Armor”</h2>
            <p>The Mutant Integration Liberation Front's Stealth Armor is unique in that it has been specifically designed to accommodate mutants of different shapes and sizes. Unlike other stealth armor that is primarily designed for human wearers, the MILF's armor can be adjusted to fit the larger, bulkier frames of super mutants and other mutated creatures. This is because it’s effectively the guts of several spent stealth boys used to create a more robust stealth field projector that can be recharged and attached to any suit of armor at all. Or even clothing. Or one’s bare skin.</p>
            <p>Frankly you can stick them on anything duct tape will adhere to, and by god it will be cloaked from sight. Unless its too big. But at the very least, part of it will be hidden from prying eyes.</p>
            <p>Like your basic stealth field projector, Stealth “Armor” renders the wearer nearly invisible to both the naked eye and electronic detection systems while dampening sound within the stealth field. While this makes it harder for the user to hear, it also makes it harder for them to be heard.</p>
            <p>While a stealth boy offers near perfect invisibility, the armor’s effect is somewhat reduced due to being made from recycled systems without the use of the appropriate technology for such a delicate operation. It works more like active camouflage than a true cloaking device, and can be spotted with the naked eye via distortions of texture, shape, or color when the wearer is moving.</p>
            <p>However its’ far from useless as there is no better camouflage than a ghillie suit that adjust itself and can as readily imitate a bush as it can an office chair. What MILF Stealth Armor looses in stealth capabilities, it more than makes up for in power efficiency as it is able to stay in use for ten times longer than conventional stealth systems.</p>
            <p>Not bad for what amounts to a recycling program.</p>
            <h2>MILF Agricultural Education</h2>
            <p>The MILF makes use of specialist knowledge for food production which can only be obtained by mutants who are able to withstand radiation both as an ambient part of the environment and as an ingested contaminant. These methods allow the MILF to cultivate crops and livestock in a world where mutations have altered the landscape and creatures of the wasteland.</p>
            <p>One methods is the use of radiation-resistant crops to cultivate radiation immune strains of those crops. These plants have been especially bred through selection (or sometimes genetically modified) to thrive in areas with high levels of radiation, allowing farmers to grow crops in areas that would otherwise be unusable due to contamination.</p>
            <p>Some examples of radiation-resistant crops include:</p>
            <ol>
            <li aria-level="1">Glowing Agave - This plant is a mutated version of the agave plant and is commonly found in the southwestern United States. Its leaves and sap contain a faint greenish glow due to the high levels of radiation it has been exposed to. The Glowing Agave is similar to the Agave plant, but its leaves are thicker and more succulent.</li>
            <li aria-level="1">Shinefruit - This is a small, yellow fruit that is found on a mutated version of the blackberry bush. The Shinefruit emits a faint greenish glow due to the high levels of radiation it has been exposed to. It is similar to the real-world blackberry, but its fruit is smaller and sweeter.</li>
            <li aria-level="1">Steel Beans: These beans are high in protein and were bred to be more resistant to radiation. They have a nutty flavor and are perfect for soups, stews, and casseroles. They are similar to the "Black Turtle" bean.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>But the mother of all MILF crops is Radiant Barley. Radiant Barley is a cultivar of barley developed by the Mutant Integration Liberation Front (MILF) using advanced breeding techniques to enhance its resistance to radiation. The plant is hardy and can tolerate high levels of radiation, making it a valuable food source for those living in the wasteland.</p>
            <p>Radiant Barley is a tall and slender plant, with long, slender leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow grains. It has a slightly sweeter and nuttier flavor than traditional barley, making it a favorite among wasteland farmers and cooks.</p>
            <p>Compared to regular barley, Radiant Barley is much more resistant to the harmful effects of radiation. It can grow in soil contaminated with higher levels of radiation, and the grains themselves have lower levels of radiation, making them safer to consume.</p>
            <p>Radiant Barley is a versatile crop, used in a variety of dishes including soups, stews, and salads. It can also be ground into flour and used to make bread, cakes, and other baked goods. Its high nutritional content and ability to grow in harsh conditions make it a valuable asset to the MILF and other wasteland communities.</p>
            <p>The MILF sells it freely to any who wish to buy it as a part of their good will policy. However certain varieties of it have been created expressly for feeding mutants and are unsafe for humans to consume due to the much higher levels of radiation.</p>
            <p>Another technique for food production the MILF employees is the use of irradiated soil. While this may seem counterintuitive, some farmers have found that crops grown in irradiated soil can actually be more robust and nutrient-dense. This is because the radiation can stimulate the growth of the plants, leading to larger yields and higher-quality crops.</p>
            <p>To this end, the MILF has created many blends of soil and radioactive compounds which they use in different stages of the cultivation process. Many of these soils allow for healthy and abundant crops without the use of fertiliser.</p>

        <p>The Scrap Collectors are a group of resourceful individuals who have managed to survive and thrive in the post-apocalyptic world by salvaging and repairing what others have left behind. They are based out of the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, which they have renamed the Scrap Heap. This massive structure has become their headquarters, workshop, and marketplace, where they repair and sell everything from car parts to electronics.</p>
        <p>The group was founded by a small band of survivors who stumbled upon the Astrodome and saw its potential as a safe haven and base of operations. They began to scavenge the surrounding areas for materials and tools, and soon became known for their ability to repair and restore anything they found. Over time, their reputation grew, and they started receiving requests from other groups to repair their equipment or sell them spare parts.</p>
        <p>The Scrap Collectors have a strict code of ethics, and they never take more than they need or cause harm to others. They are a neutral faction, and they do not get involved in the conflicts between other groups, preferring to remain independent and focus on their own goals. Their main priority is to ensure the survival of their group and provide a valuable service to others in need.</p>
        <p>The group is led by a woman named Maria, who has a background in engineering and a natural talent for leadership. She is respected and admired by the other members of the group, who trust her judgment and expertise. Maria is a firm but fair leader, who sets high standards for the group and expects everyone to contribute to their best ability.</p>
        <p>The Scrap Collectors' operation is divided into several departments, each with its own specialized skills and responsibilities. There are mechanics who repair vehicles and machinery, electricians who fix electronics, and metalworkers who fabricate new parts from salvaged materials. They also have a team of scavengers who venture out into the wasteland to find new items to repair and sell.</p>
        <p>The group is self-sufficient, and they have developed their own system of trade using scrap metal as currency. They have a thriving market inside the Astrodome, where they sell their repaired goods to other groups or individuals who need them. They also offer their services to others for a fee, and their reputation for quality work has made them one of the most sought-after groups in the wasteland.</p>
        <p>Despite the dangers of the post-apocalyptic world, the Scrap Collectors have managed to create a thriving community within the walls of the Astrodome. They have built their own living quarters and have even started to cultivate a small garden to provide fresh produce. Their success is a testament to their resilience, resourcefulness, and determination to survive and thrive in even the harshest of environments.</p>

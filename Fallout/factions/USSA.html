        <p>The Space Pioneers are a semi-isolationist group working and living within the Johnson Space Center, a pre-war United States Space Agency (USSA) facility dedicated to space travel and exploration. Specifically, the R&D and mission control parts of the US Space Program. While referred to as the Space Pioneers in a joking manner by wasters, they refer to themselves as the USSA nad retain the use of their pre-war iconography and terminology, save for having designed a new USSA logo for the post-war era.</p>
        <p>The Space Pioneers are often compared to the Brotherhood of Steel, and with good reason. They are a semi-isolationist group equipped with advanced technology who have divided themselves into distinct internal groups each with a purpose who are overseen by a single individual and function close to a combination knightly / monastic order. The Space Pioneers plunder pre-war technology, taking certain items by force if need be, and hoard the majority of their technology for themselves.</p>
        <p>The key differences is the Space Pioneers mission is benevolent. They recruit outside of their faction, often undertake missions for the common good, and offer their assistance to wasters for free or in trade. While they employ violence they do so only as a last resort, prefeing trade and exchange wherever possible. They are well liked by the common people for this, but have made dire enemies with the Houston Technocrats as both groups have warred over certain pieces of salvage in the past.</p>
        <p>While largely benevolent, the Space Pioneers have a list of things they require for “the Mission”. These things are either irreplaceable or functionally unique, and as such they will do everything in their considerable power to obtain them. Failing to obtain these items is seen as an existential threat for humanity. Not their group. Humanity.</p>
        <p>The Mission, properly known as Operation Prometheus, is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>☑ Construct a rocket launch platform and gantry.
          <li>☑ Construct a spacecraft able to reach MEO (Medium Earth Orbit).
          <li>☐ Use the Johnson Orbital Launch Platform to send a spacecraft to the remaining space stations and acquire untainted genetic samples of human, animal, and plant DNA stored there for scientific research.
          <li>☐ Repair at least one Research Station.
          <li>☐ Develop gene therapy to repair human DNA.
          <li>☐ Use unmutated crop DNA to create crops suited for modern Earth.
          <li>☐ Clone and re-seed keystone species.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>34 years ago, the Space Pioneers have reached a bottleneck relating to fuling their craft. The Houston Technocrats possess the capacity to create the LOX/RP-1 fuel necessary for the mission, but refuse to do so due both to their archrival status and seeing many of the mutations within the human genome, the general ecological state of the world, and limited crop varieties as important and necessary for their own plans.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the last few decades have seen many acts of espionage, sabotage, and limited enguagments as the Pioneers attempt to obtain the tech needed to create the fuel, and the Technocrats sabotage the Pioneer’s efforts to develop alternative propulsion. Currently the Pioneers are attempting to create a fusion reactor to power a massive gauss launcher to get the ship into LEO, where they can make use of fuels they can produce to finish the mission.</p>
        <p>The reactor is proving difficult to create for reasons they do not disclose to outsiders, lest the Technocrats find a new avenue to sabotage the Mission. Strictly speaking, the Center’s existing fusion reactor could power the launch system, but only the launch system. The Space Pioneers firmly believe the Center’s photonic resonance shield and laser defense grid must remain fully powered during the launch, lest their rivals or some other enemy shoot down Prometheus 1 (as their ship has been christened).</p>
        <p>The history of the Space Pioneers is both well documented and critical to understanding them as a faction. While it should be noted the documentation comes from themselves</p>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">History</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>In 2077 the United States Space Administration (USSA) was working overtime to attempt to breach the politics surrounding the Mars Shot mission and ensure it wouldn’t be delayed. To ensure the mission would launch as planned on July 4th 2078 the Johnson Space Center had been put into full operation following a decades long period of reduced operations.</p>
          <p>Not only were there countless research, development, and training operations to do, but the facility also needed renovations, upgrades, and even additional facilities built to handle the mission control operations of the upcoming Mars mission. Consequently, the center was fully staffed round the clock, seeing an average of 3,200 people on any given day and hour.</p>
          <p>On Saturday, October 23, 2077 at 09:13 EST the USSA was asked to help confirm the launch of Chinese nuclear weapons by the Integrated Operational Nuclear Detection System. The JSC’s orbital tracking systems verified the launch within moments. This was the Big One. The moment every American had dreaded for decades.</p>
          <p>In the event of a Nuclear Exchange, the Center was to use its force fields to weather an attack and coordinate defenses of military institutions across the whole of the USA. In the moment Director Rory Floriane chose to ignore those orders. Houston was not only the home of everyone at the Center, it was where their families were. The standing orders were refused.</p>

          <div class="textboxorange">
          <p><em>"As scientists and engineers, it is our duty to use our knowledge and expertise for the betterment of humanity. We cannot stand idly by while innocent lives are threatened by self-interested politicians who long ago forgot why they were entrusted with power. Our mission is to explore the mysteries of the universe to the quality of life on Earth. We have the power to save lives today, those of the people, or those of the government which would cast them aside. I choose to do what is right, not what I have been ordered to do. I pray you choose to do the right thing as well because I cannot do this alone."</em></p>
          </div>

          <p>Roused by the Director’s speech, the majority of the USSA employees followed the call to act. A brief firefight occurred between the Center’s security personnel and the small Enclave detachment based at the Center. The Security forces won, primarily due to the Enclave forces being taken entirly by supprise with most of them Center called the local military and national guard bases, bypassing the chain of command, and began passing target tracking data directly to the people who would be launching countermeasures.</p>
          <p>The Center’s full staff set to the task of defending Houston as much as possible. The Center’s STARSHIELD (Spacecraft Tracking and Automatic Response System for High-risk Emergency and Launch Defense) system was activated and quickly retasked to shoot down incoming warheads rather than debris from a failed rocket launch. Laboratories cleared space to create field hospitals for the aftermath.</p>
          <p>The Center stopped 89 of 94 warheads launched at Houston (most of which were directed at the Center, given its roll in coordinating the national missile defense arrays). The Center tasked itself with its current mission within months of the Great War, though did not seriously begin work on it for 30 years, as the need to create stable food, water, and personnel supplies came first.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The Space Pioneers are highly intelligent and technologically advanced, with access to cutting-edge equipment and research facilities. They have a deep knowledge of physics, chemistry, and engineering, and are constantly developing new technologies and inventions to improve their lives and the lives of others.</p>
        <p>The Space Pioneers are not a military faction, and they do not seek to conquer or dominate others. Instead, they are focused on creating a better future for all humanity, and are willing to share their knowledge and resources with others who share their vision. They are idealistic and optimistic, and believe that humanity can overcome the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world by working together and using science to solve problems.</p>
        <p>However, the Space Pioneers are not without their enemies. Some see their technological advances as a threat, and fear that they could become too powerful and dominant. Others see them as naive and unrealistic, and believe that their idealism will ultimately lead to failure and disappointment. The Space Pioneers must navigate these challenges and conflicts as they work to rebuild the space program and create a new future for humanity.</p>

        <h1>Organization and Culture</h1>
        <p>The Space Pioneers have one of the most clean cut and formal organization systems of any post-war organization. The group is overseen by the Director of the Johnson Space Center, who is analogous to a king though their power is limited by the Mission Chater. Beneath them are the Facility Directors, a small group consisting of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Director of Life Support </strong>- Oversees the personnel’s living arrangements and daily needs.</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Director of Research </strong>- Oversees all R&amp;D operations.</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Director of Mission Control</strong> - Oversees the handling of existing elements and protocols relating to Operation Prometheus, including Center Security, parts fabrication, construction, and maintenance.</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Director of the Space Force</strong> - Oversees the Center’s armed forces. Organizes, manages, and executes “away missions” both peaceful or hostile. Plans defensive and offensive operations against current threats.</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Director of the Astronaut Program</strong> - Trains, maintains, and equips the Prometheus Crew, including pilots, co-pilots, commanders, engineers, and repair workers. Keeps a primary, secondary, and tertiary crew ready to go at all times.</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Director of Custodians</strong> - Responsible for basic upkeep of the Center including cleaning, maintenance, and day-to-day assistance of Center personnel with immediate problems relating to the center’s facilities (stuck door, missing key, ID badge issues, stolen lunch, etc).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As one would expect, each director is responsible for a Department of the same name, save for Life Support which is referred to as the Department of Residential Services. Members of these departments are given the following titles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Department of Residential Services</strong> - Facilities Officer</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Research Department </strong>- Science Officer</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Mission Control Department</strong> - Mission Control Officer</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Department of the Space Force</strong> - Ranger</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Department of the Astronaut Program</strong> - Operations Officer</li>
          <li aria-level="1"><strong>Custodian Department </strong>- Custodial Officer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These departments make use of a simple ranks structure, similar to military ranks, to organize their members by responsibility and authority level. The ranks are shared across all departments for reasons of equality and moral. The rank emblems are also simple, taking the form of small black or brass “pips” attached to one’s collar and/or on their sleeves beneath the Department Emblem Patch.</p>
        <p>The ranks are, in order of greatest to least:</p>
        <ul>
          <li aria-level="1">Director of the Center - <span class="pips">○●●●●●</span></li>
          <li aria-level="1">Director - <span class="pips">●●●●</span></li>
          <li aria-level="1">Captain - <span class="pips">○●●●</span></li>
          <li aria-level="1">Commander - <span class="pips">●●●</span></li>
          <li aria-level="1">Lieutenant Commander - <span class="pips">○●●</span></li>
          <li aria-level="1">Lieutenant - <span class="pips">●●</span></li>
          <li aria-level="1">Lieutenant Junior Grade - <span class="pips">○●</span></li>
          <li aria-level="1">Ensign - <span class="pips">●</span></li>
          <li aria-level="1">Chief petty officer - <span class="pips">○</span></li>
          <li aria-level="1">Cadet - (No pips)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typically speaking, all children living in the Center hold the rank of Cadet, as most of their recruits come form within (Individuals who do not wish to contribute to the Mission are typically sent away, and almost always come back within a month willing to work.), but is also granted to outsiders who are willing to assist with the Mission.</p>
        <p>Cadets are educated formally in something akin to pre-war schooling, then transferred to an apprenticeship, where younger members are paired with experienced mentors who guide them through whichever Department they find appealing, or were assigned to.</p>
        <p>The Space Pioneers' culture is one of curiosity and exploration. Members are united by their passion for space and their belief that humanity's future lies beyond the confines of Earth. They are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and technology, despite the apparent impossibility of their Mission.</p>
        <h1>Headquarters</h1>

          <figcaption>Headquarters of JSC</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The Space Pioneers are based out of the Johnson Space Center, a complex of 100 buildings constructed on 1,620 acres (660 ha) in the Clear Lake Area of Houston, which acquired the official nickname "Space City" in 1967.</p>
      	<p>It stands almost as it did pre-war thanks to its elaborate defense system. This system's primary active feature is STARSHIELD, a large network of laser arrays intended to vaporize the debris from failed rocket launches from it's newly constructed Transit Launch Platform. The STARSHIELD has been repurposed into a defense array capable of attacking ground, air, and sea targets. The Center's primary defensive measure is a massive dome-shield system comprised of photonic energy barriers which allowed it to weather the Great War intact by blocking both the nuclear detonations and EMPs (the dome has never taken a direct hit, and may be vulnerable to such a strike).</p>
      	<p>The facility functions as a well regulated city, home to nearly 8,000 individuals, and containing the entity of the Pioneer's operations. Save of course for small temporary outposts for study and/or salvage within the badlands, and their few permanent postings at communal wasteland trade hubs. It is therefore key to the Pioneer's operations, their first and last stronghold.</p>

        <p>The Ranchers are a commerce-based faction that has established itself as a major player in the post-apocalyptic economy. They operate out of a large ranch known as the Ranch House, which is located a good distance east of Houston, Texas. The group is primarily involved in raising, slaughtering, and selling Brahmin and other types of livestock to the people living within the ruins of Houston.</p>
        <p>The Ranchers were founded shortly after the collapse of civilization by a group of survivors who had experience in ranching and animal husbandry. They saw an opportunity to establish a profitable business in the wasteland by providing a much-needed resource: meat. Over time, the Ranchers expanded their operations, acquiring more land and livestock and building a reputation for quality and reliability.</p>
        <p>The Ranch House is a sprawling complex that includes a large barn, stables, and processing facilities. The Ranchers employ a team of skilled workers who are responsible for tending to the animals, slaughtering and processing the meat, and transporting it to market. They have also established their own security force to protect their property and assets.</p>
        <p>The Ranchers are led by a man named James, who is known for his shrewd business sense and ability to make tough decisions. James has a background in finance and management, which has served him well in the post-apocalyptic world. He is respected and admired by his fellow Ranchers, who appreciate his leadership and vision.</p>
        <p>The Ranchers are not affiliated with any particular faction or group, and they remain neutral in conflicts between other groups.</p>
        <p>The Ranchers are a self-sufficient community, producing their own food and generating their own power. They have established their own infrastructure, including wells for water and wind turbines for electricity. They also have a small medical clinic on site, staffed by a trained physician who provides basic medical care to the Ranchers and their livestock.</p>
        <p>Despite the harsh conditions of the post-apocalyptic world, the Ranchers have managed to thrive and prosper. Their success is a testament to their ingenuity, hard work, and commitment to their business. They have become an integral part of the economy of the wasteland, providing a much-needed resource to those who need it most.</p>
        <p>Their products are in such demand that they are responsible for the creation of the Badland's primary currency, the Longhorn. A Longhorn is a strip of leather (specifically made from the ears of a cow) which are tattooed with a simple series of vertical bars, then branded with a ranch's brand. Each Longhorn represents a value equal to one head of cattle, and can be cut into six strips by following the guide lines that were tattooed onto the cow in life. Values less than a sixth of a cow are represented through the use of pre-war coins. A full Longhorn is valued at 300 caps, a Strip is therefore worth 50 caps, and a Strip can be split into 5 nickles worth 10 caps each, with a nickel being worth 10 pennies roughly equal to 1 cap.</p>
      	<p>The Longhorn is an especially useful currency as they rot, removing themselves from circulation at roughly a quarter of the rate they are produced. This helps control inflation. The currency is also practically counterfeiting proof as the type of leather used makes non-cow derived leather easy to spot, and to create a Longhorn one must raise a cow, which creates the value the currency represents. Each head of cattle can create two Longhorns, but officially only the right ear can be used (as this is the ear traditionally tagged pre-war).</p>
      	<p>The Ranchers do not care if other groups create Longhorns, as they do not seek to control the currency. They simply created it as a convenience.</p>

      <h1>Attis Army</h1>
      <p><figure><img src="../img/AttisArmyLogo.webp" style="width:100%"><figcaption>Attis Army Emblem</figcaption></figure>Attis's Army is one of two offshoots of the Unity, along with that of Gammorin's, led by Attis, a previous commander of the Master.</p>
      <p>Attis's Army is located in the central region of the former United States, and is comprised primarily of mutants who have been altered through the use of Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) by Attis. The faction is known for their violent and aggressive behavior, as well as their extreme loyalty to Attis.</p>
      <p>Despite their origins, Attis's Army has developed a rudimentary industrial base centered around the production and maintenance of weapons and armor. They have also established a number of crude settlements throughout the region, which serve as bases of operations for their raids and military campaigns.</p>
      <p>Attis's Army has a limited infrastructure, primarily consisting of the crude settlements mentioned earlier. They do not have a formal transportation network or communication lines, relying instead on word of mouth and a system of messengers to relay information.</p>
      <p>In terms of military capabilities, Attis's Army is a formidable force, with a large number of mutants who have been altered through the use of FEV. These mutants are stronger and more resistant to damage than typical humans, making them formidable opponents in battle. Attis's Army also has a number of advanced weapons and armor that they have salvaged from pre-war military installations.</p>
      <p>Attis's leadership style is characterized by fear and intimidation, and he has shown a willingness to use violence to achieve his goals. He is fiercely loyal to the ideals of the Unity and the Master, and seeks to spread these ideals throughout the wasteland.</p>
      <p>Attis's Army is a significant threat to other factions in the region, and has clashed with a number of them over territory and resources. Despite this, they have also formed alliances with some factions, particularly those who share their views on the use of force to achieve their goals.</p>

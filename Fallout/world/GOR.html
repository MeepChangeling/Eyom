      <h1>The Tribe of Goris</h1>
      <p><figure><img src="../img/GOR.webp" style="width:100%"><figcaption>The Tribe of Goris Mark</figcaption></figure>After their initial encounter with the Chosen One and the defeat of the Enclave, the deathclaws of Vault 13 began to explore their newfound intelligence and abilities. They formed a close-knit community within the vault, and began to experiment with new technologies and innovations that they had learned from the Chosen One and their travels.</p>
      <p>As the years went by, the Tribe of Goris grew in both size and power. They became renowned for their intelligence, strength, and loyalty, and formed close alliances with many factions throughout the wasteland.</p>
      <p>The Tribe's leader, Goris, became a respected figure in the NCR, serving as a diplomat and mediator between the deathclaws and the human factions of the region. Under his guidance, the Tribe began to take an active role in the defense and protection of the wasteland, working closely with the Desert Rangers and other factions to maintain peace and order.</p>
      <p>The Tribe of Goris also became known for their unique culture and traditions. They developed their own language and customs, and became skilled in the arts of metallurgy and engineering. They built their own towns and settlements, and established trade networks with other factions throughout the wasteland.</p>
      <p>Over time, the Tribe of Goris became a true force to be reckoned with, feared by their enemies and respected by their allies. They continued to thrive and prosper, maintaining their close ties with the NCR and other factions, and working tirelessly to protect and rebuild the wasteland in the wake of the Great War.</p>
      <p>The Tribe of Goris was also known for their acceptance of human-deathclaw families. These families were initially met with skepticism and resistance from both humans and deathclaw members of the tribe. However, as time went on, they were gradually accepted and even celebrated for their unique abilities and contributions to the community.</p>
      <p>These families were able to bridge the gap between the two species culturally, and physically. A few rare mutations found in both the human and deathclaw species allowed these mutants to reproduce, hybridizing the two species. The hybrids bore the best traits of both humans and deathclaws, though were exceptionally rare and were unable to reproduce themselves. Deathclaws saw the hybrids as just another claw, though the human members were often disturbed by the more humanlike physical and mental traits hybrids possessed.</p>
      <p>Despite facing many challenges, the hybrids played an important role in the Tribe of Gorisâ€™ success.They became skilled hunters, warriors, and craftsmen, and helped to develop new technologies and innovations that benefited the entire tribe. They were also far more adept at speaking human languages than the other intelligent deathclaws, allowing them to be great diplomats.</p>
      <p>Over time, the human-deathclaw hybrids became an integral part of the Tribe of Goris, and were seen as an important bridge between the deathclaws and the humans of the wasteland. They were able to break down barriers and stereotypes, and showed that cooperation and mutual respect could lead to a brighter future for all.</p>

      <h1>The NCR</h1>
      <p><figure><img src="../img/NCRlogo.webp" style="width:100%"><figcaption>NCR Seal</figcaption></figure>The NCR is a large, democratic republic that controls much of the western United States, stretching from California to Nevada, Arizona, and parts of Oregon and Washington. Its capital is located in the former city of Los Angeles, which has been rebuilt as a sprawling metropolis with skyscrapers, highways, and advanced infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Under the leadership of President Tandi's descendants, the NCR has become a prosperous and powerful nation, with a population of several million people and a diverse economy that includes agriculture, manufacturing, and high-tech industries.</p>
      <p>The NCR has also established a strong military, with a well-trained army that includes both regular troops and specialized units such as rangers, snipers, and elite commandos. The NCR military is well-equipped with advanced weapons and vehicles, including power armor, energy weapons, and vertibirds.
      The NCR's industrial base is focused on advanced manufacturing, with factories producing everything from robots and computers to weapons and vehicles. The NCR is also a leader in renewable energy, with large-scale solar and wind farms powering much of the republic's infrastructure.</p>
      <p>In terms of infrastructure, the NCR has invested heavily in transportation, building a network of highways, railways, and airfields that connect its major cities and military bases. The NCR also has a robust telecommunications network, including satellite communication and high-speed internet access.
      The current leader of the NCR is President Aaron Kimball, a charismatic and popular politician who has overseen the republic's continued expansion and prosperity. Kimball is a strong supporter of the NCR military and has emphasized the importance of maintaining the republic's security in an increasingly dangerous and chaotic wasteland.</p>

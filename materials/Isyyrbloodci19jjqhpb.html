The Isyyr is a small packs-based carnivore. A Isyyr looks like nothing else, posessing a  head with two large horns, four legs long and slender ending in claws, and a short tail. The creature's blood holds special properties. Isyyr Blood's properties are mostly magical in nature, but do make use of its natural makeup and is uniquly useful in the process of making textiles. Isyyr Blood was first discovered by the teacher <a href="../people/GaerthelhuAmenemhatnrtun0sp2r.html">Gaerthel hu Amenemhat </a> within the <a href="../localregions/G̈pîk-canaGrasslands.html">G̈pîk-cana Grasslands</a> durring the late 17th century in late summer of the year 1695.

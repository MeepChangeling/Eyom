<h3 class="articletitle">Oewk Hide</h3>
The Oewk is a small solitary carnivore. A Oewk looks like nothing else, posessing a stone-like head adorned with a crest-like ridge, four legs bent ending in talons, and a rabbit-like tail. The creature's hide holds special properties. Oewk Hide's properties are a blend of its material nature and magical makeup and is uniquly useful in the process of bookbinding. Oewk Hide was first discovered by the rancher <a href="../people/GadshëmOwainesqbbrzsyl7m.html">Gadshëm Owaines</a> within the <a href="../localregions/SprokbujuForest.html">Sprokbuju Forest</a> durring the late 18th century in early spring of the year 1751.

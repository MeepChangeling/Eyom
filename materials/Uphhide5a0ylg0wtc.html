The Uph is a small herd-based carnivore. A Uph looks like nothing else, posessing a dog-like head covered in thick bone-armor plates, four legs bent ending in talons, and a short tail. The creature's hide holds special properties. Uph Hide's properties are mostly magical in nature, but do make use of its natural makeup and is uniquly useful in agriculture. Uph Hide was first discovered by the teacher <a href="../people/JargrakvyimRoxlendfilf2sp8lz3nqz.html">Jargrak vyim Roxlendfilf</a> within the <a href="../localregions/Kùjíhgqi̊vùHolt.html">Kùjíhgqi̊vù Holt</a> durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1463.

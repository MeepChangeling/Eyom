<h3 class="articletitle">Zelkr Hide</h3>
The Zelkr is a huge packs-based carnivore. A Zelkr looks like nothing else, posessing a dog-like head covered in thick bone-armor plates, four legs long and slender ending in hooves, and a long feline-like tail. The creature's hide holds special properties. Zelkr Hide's properties are mostly magical in nature, but do make use of its natural makeup and is uniquly useful for making dye. Zelkr Hide was first discovered by the military leader <a href="../people/ShurthahvyimYuvnoeplə˞rdsmn04iasi5.html">Shurthah vyim Yuvnoeplə˞rd</a> within the <a href="../localregions/Vrë-brǟgrivHolt.html">Vrë-brǟgriv Holt</a> durring the early 18th century in late winter of the year 1723.

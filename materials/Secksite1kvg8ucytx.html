Secksite is a lumpy very glossey predominalty light grey metamorphic rock with auburn streaks and small glints of red. Secksite's properties are mostly magical in nature, but do make use of its natural makeup and is uniquly useful in the process of bookbinding. Secksite was first discovered by the scholar <a href="../people/SzazzoShêtcoi6sg61w2xy.html">Szazzo Shêtco</a> within the <a href="../localregions/Mo̠l-sie̜lHolt.html">Mo̠l-sie̜l Holt</a> durring the late 20th century in late summer of the year 1952.

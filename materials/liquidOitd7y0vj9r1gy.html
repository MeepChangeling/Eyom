<h3 class="articletitle">Liquid Oitd</h3>
liquid Oitd is a thick amber fluid which glows rose and smells like a thousand hobos, with a thousand different diseases, took turn peeing in it for a thousand years. Then, just to spice things up, they ate nothing but plague rats for a year and filled the room containing the oil to the ceiling with vomit. Only for maggots to eat that vomit, die, and rot to dust. The dust attracted a colony of fruitbats who ate nothing but durians for another thousand years, leaving the rotting bits of fruit they dropped to fester on the floor. Then just before you sniffed the oil some poor janitor came in to clean the place and chose to light themselves on fire, adding the smell of burnt meat and human hair to the cocktail of tangible filth before you. That's from a ten minute walk upwind of the stuff. It tastes like candy.. Liquid Oitd's properties are entirly magical in nature and is uniquly useful in stone cutting and masonry. Liquid Oitd was first discovered by the miner <a href="../people/Ca̋chvónḱMpfénḱStarWavyNidaw̋YoīkībVúó̄Crowtherosyslyih15l.html">Ca̋chvónḱ Mpfénḱ 'Star Wavy' Nidaw̋ Yoīkīb Vúó̄ Crowthero</a> within the <a href="../localregions/Mækyitjĭe-kělHolt.html">Mækyitjĭe-kěl Holt</a> durring the late 10th century.

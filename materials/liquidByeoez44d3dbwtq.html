<h3 class="articletitle">Liquid Byeoe</h3>
liquid Byeoe is a wattery dark brown fluid which smells like a thousand hobos, with a thousand different diseases, took turn peeing in it for a thousand years. Then, just to spice things up, they ate nothing but plague rats for a year and filled the room containing the oil to the ceiling with vomit. Only for maggots to eat that vomit, die, and rot to dust. The dust attracted a colony of fruitbats who ate nothing but durians for another thousand years, leaving the rotting bits of fruit they dropped to fester on the floor. Then just before you sniffed the oil some poor janitor came in to clean the place and chose to light themselves on fire, adding the smell of burnt meat and human hair to the cocktail of tangible filth before you. That's from a ten minute walk upwind of the stuff. It tastes like candy.. Liquid Byeoe's properties are entirly magical in nature and is uniquly useful in the creation of paper and paper-like materials. Liquid Byeoe was first discovered by the carpenter <a href="../people/Falassiel5v5qfn6qb8.html">Falassiel</a> within the <a href="../localregions/PiropisiHolt.html">Piropisi Holt</a> durring the early 17th century in spring of the year 1616.

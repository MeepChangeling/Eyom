The Uedpsi is a small solitary herbavore. A Uedpsi looks like nothing else, posessing a flat-faced head adorned with a crest-like ridge, four legs short ending in paws, and a blunt tail. The creature's hide holds special properties. Uedpsi Hide's properties are mostly magical in nature, but do make use of its natural makeup and is uniquly useful for making dye. Uedpsi Hide was first discovered by the smith <a href="../people/VeahlTumrodusizb37rs70.html">Veahl Tumrodu</a> within the <a href="../localregions/Wötsëntrok-zbenHolt.html">Wötsëntrok-zben Holt</a> durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1361.

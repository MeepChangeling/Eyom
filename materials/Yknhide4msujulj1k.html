<h3 class="articletitle">Ykn Hide</h3>
The Ykn is a huge packs-based omnivore. A Ykn looks like nothing else, posessing a dog-like head with two large horns, four legs lankey ending in broad paws, and a rabbit-like tail. The creature's hide holds special properties. Ykn Hide's properties are mostly magical in nature, but do make use of its natural makeup and is uniquly useful to the arcane arts. Ykn Hide was first discovered by the explorer <a href="../people/DyèjKeyesCowanj2qrrx0mkm.html">Dyèj Keyes Cowan</a> within the <a href="../localregions/Rêsë-oyiFields.html">Rêsë-oyi Fields</a> durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1195.

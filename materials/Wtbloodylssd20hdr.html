The Wt is a medium solitary carnivore. A Wt looks like nothing else, posessing a stone-like head with a single horn, four legs long and slender ending in broad paws, and a blunt tail. The creature's blood holds special properties. Wt Blood's properties are mostly magical in nature, but do make use of its natural makeup and is uniquly useful in the process of making textiles. Wt Blood was first discovered by the inventor <a href="../people/MlîbShumungoqx7fpcfcfb.html">Mlîb Shumungo</a> within the <a href="../localregions/Lǟchy-nëbësWoodlands.html">Lǟchy-nëbës Woodlands</a> durring the early 17th century in fall of the year 1614.

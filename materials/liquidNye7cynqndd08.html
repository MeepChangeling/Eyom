<h3 class="articletitle">Liquid Nye</h3>
liquid Nye is a wattery gray fluid which glows white and smells like a thousand hobos, with a thousand different diseases, took turn peeing in it for a thousand years. Then, just to spice things up, they ate nothing but plague rats for a year and filled the room containing the oil to the ceiling with vomit. Only for maggots to eat that vomit, die, and rot to dust. The dust attracted a colony of fruitbats who ate nothing but durians for another thousand years, leaving the rotting bits of fruit they dropped to fester on the floor. Then just before you sniffed the oil some poor janitor came in to clean the place and chose to light themselves on fire, adding the smell of burnt meat and human hair to the cocktail of tangible filth before you. That's from a ten minute walk upwind of the stuff. It tastes like candy.. Liquid Nye's properties are entirly mundane and is uniquly useful in the milling of various grains. Liquid Nye was first discovered by the teacher <a href="../people/Tsaykh́vyimRolɑrtɑtræ̝rgd8nhx5wz0k.html">Tsaykh́ vyim Rolɑrtɑtræ̝rg</a> within the <a href="../localregions/MböKǟsForest.html">Mbö Kǟs Forest</a> in time immemorial. Tsaykh́ vyim Rolɑrtɑtræ̝rg's discover was believed to have occured some time durring the early 3rd century.

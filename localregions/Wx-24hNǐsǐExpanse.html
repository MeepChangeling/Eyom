<h4 class="articlesubtitle">People and Culture</h4>
<p>Imperial Warning: The following section of this document deals with biological race. In deference to the traditions of Eyomic peoples, we have foregone town-specific racial census. However, as our culture lacks a taboo for classification of peoples by their biology and such information is highly important for our medical practices amongst other institutions, we have stated the racial demographics of this region. We do not do so to sew the seeds of disunity. We do not do so to belittle or bemoan any group. Such issues are why we use the term 'peoples' rather than races, cultures, or species.</p>
<p>In respect to this universal cultural element, we have split racial classification by culture while keeping the name of each race for our own purposes. Should you see the same race listed more than once in the following section, this is to designate a major cultural division within a race.</p>
<p>The Wx-24h Nǐsǐ Expanse is's peoples are culturally <a href="../cultures/construct.html">Constructi</a>, but have their local customs and traditions. Their shared values and traditions include prosperity and accruing material wealth and loyalty to one’s friends, family, and own, as well as a unique music festival and a beer festival.

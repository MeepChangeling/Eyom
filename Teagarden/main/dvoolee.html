      <h1>Dvole</h1>
      <p>Dvole <span class="paren">(Local Spelling Dvȏ lë pron. /dvʊ jɔɪ̯/ aka Teegarden b)</span> is an exoplanet orbiting Teegarden's Star, an M-type red dwarf 12.5 light years away from the Solar System. It has the highest Earth Similarity Index of any exoplanet found to-date. Dvole is habitable by humans without any technology or special precushions, though many humans find it unpleasently dim.</p>
        <h2>Geography and Climate</h2>
        <p>The vast majority of Dvole is covered by a type of dense forest biome the locals call thra̯ <span class="paren">(pron. /ðɤɑ̯/)</span>. Thra̯ greatly resembles a redwood forest from Earth, abeit with additional features typicaly found within tropical rainforests. The primary diffrence being the presence of emergant, canopy, understory, and forest floor layers. Most humans think of thra̯ as "a jungle, from the Pacific Northwest".</p>
        <p>The rest of the planet's surfice is primarily savanah and wetland, with deserts occuring exceptionaly rarly, and only where allowed by topography. Dvole is an exceptionaly wet planet, receving 3.27 times more rainfall than Earth. Compounding this diffrence is Dvole's short orbital piriod and axial tilt prevent seasons from occuring. The planet experiances a warm and wet climate year round, with daily rainfall occuring regurarly in the evenings.</p>
        <p>Storms occure infrequently, typicaly taking the form of typhoons and thunderstorms. Dvole's flora have adapted to the frequent thunderstorms, incorporating lightning strikes and fires into their lifecycle.</p>


           with jungle-like overgrowth. What little of Dvole is not covered by its forest is either ocean or the planet's singular dessart, Pay <span class="paren">(pron. /peɪ̯/)</span>.</p>


      <p>The planet's name comes from the native population's dominante langauge Sirah <span class="paren">(pron. /ˈsɪɹɔː/)</span>. The native Dvooleeians <span class="paren">(called Mdie, pron. /mdiː/)</span> are a species of canid-like creatures with a humanoid body plan. The Mdie were discovered after the USE Roddenberry made landfall at the culmination of the Teegarden's Star Colony Mission. The Mdie are a mid-information age people and exist across a few hundred cultures contained within seven empires.</p>

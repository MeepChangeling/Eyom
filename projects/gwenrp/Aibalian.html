        <p>Aibalian Elves are an elven ethnic group with no homeland known to time. They are nomadic travlers, riding along in large caravans composed of 3-5 clans with 200-300 total members within the caravan. They follow no particular paths and stay in a given area for as long as they are allowed or untill they decide for whatever reason to move on. When inhabiting a region, Aibalians do not create more permanant shelters. They simply chalk their wagons and erect or construct temporary outbuildings as they require them.</p>
        <p>Aibalian Elves are best known for their nut brown skin and seemingly being composed entirly of women. Many people have assumed their men simple value femaninity, but in truth Aibalian Elves cannot produce male offspring at all. They are mostly hermphraditic, with only 8% of their population being female, and 2% being a sex they refer to as "puella" which appear male before puberty, but are female in behavior and develop the ususal femanine breasts and curves durring puberty.</p>
        <p>This ethnic-based mutation of the elven form appears to be the remnents of a powerful spell gone wrong. Whatever it was, it occured so far in the past that magic cannot "heal" or "uncurse" an Aibalian Elf from their birth form. Magic can, howeaver, allow them to change to either of the other two avalible to their people.</p>
        <p>In any case, behaviorly it is correct to refer to all Aibalian Elves as "girls", "ladies", "gals", or if one is extreemly close with a community as a whole to understand their cultural slang terms correctly: "Pumpkin", "Babe", "Kitten", "Sweetie", "Bird", "Bae", and "Boo".</p>
        <p>Note: One should not attempt to use the community terms unless they are certain they understand the system. Incorrect labaling is one of their greatest insults, enough to incite a dule if you are not allready well liked.</p>

      <h2>Physiology and Characteristics</h2>
        <figure class="figure-left">
          <img class="textimage" src="./img/AibalianElf2.webp" alt="An Aibalian Elf, displaying her genatles.">
          <figcaption>An Aibalian Elf, displaying her genatles.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Asside from the obvious and well know diffrence, Aibalian Elves are quite typical elvanoids in terms of physiology. With two exceptions. First, their reproductive equipment is equine in shape and capable of fully retracting into their pelvis. Testies, sheath, and shaft all retract, compressing and comaptcing such that there is no sign of their male anatomy other than the lack of a cliterious which is replaced by a second vaginal-like opening. This appears to be due to their mitochondrial root ancestor siring their bloodline with a (presumed sapient) feral mare (or a centauress depending on who is telling the story) which may or may not have angered a god (or pleased the god, depending on who is telling the story and how they see Aibalian Elven atnatomy in terms of desirability.).</p>
        <p>Second, Aibalian Elves are notably faster and posess greater endurence than the elven norm. This second deviation appears to be due to a large ammount of human ancestory, allowing them to operate as persistance hunters much like humans, albit with the speed of a swift horse over short distances. They lack the strength of a horse, and thus still make use of pack animals. They prefer draconic and reptilian species for this apparently due to most of them finding horses a little too "attractive".</p>
        <p>Asside from those features, they follow the same anatomy as any other elven group. That being said, the diffrence their physical form causes within their culture is massive. Their reproductive anatomy being retractable prevents easy identification of an individual's sex, which makes them operate by gender instead. This has created a very elaborate scocial web, infintly more so than most elves, which is on par with human concepts of gender. Infact, the two species re able to easily understand the other's socical dynamics so long as the human is from a more progressive culture.</p>
        <p>Their speed and endurence is the heart of why they love to roam. Elves tend to settle in one spectacular natural vista and experiance it for their lifetimes. Aibalian Elves have the ability to quickly see everything within a few dozen hectares within a weekened and will get board of a given location fairly quickly. They see home as where their friends and lovers are, and thus have a prefrence to move from time to time when living amongst eachother or with other species who don't mind relocating because everyone wants to know what's on the other side of that mountain.</p>
        <p>A common saying is "Aibalians move with the birds." Its somewhat true, as many caravans have settled into semi-predictable routes which take them back to places every few human generations or so. These groups tend to be more friendly with outsiders and simply wish to "refresh" their friend pools more than they wish to see new pastures.</p>
        <br>
      <h2>Culture</h2>

      </figure>
        <p>Aibalian Elves are known for their fashion sense, which is either rugged and tribal with a dash of warrior flair, or an elegent yet lewd fusion of elven designs with subtle features which make the outfit suitable for combat or exploration. It's not all leather straps, loincloths, and decorative "armor" pieces, along with flowing gowns adorned with enchanted crystals and theigh-high leather boots designed for combat. Many Aibalian Elves have a more modest and contemporary taste in clothing. Or at least, they do when other cultures are looking. Aibalian Elves lack a nudity taboo, are kept comfortable reguardless of weather and climate by their natural magics, and concequently dress only for utility and attracting partners.</p>
        <p>Attracting partners is especialy important as Aibalian Elves do not practice marrage. They simply enguage in sex with "best friends", howeaver many they might have. Love and friendship are inseperable to their culture. They will, for the sake of intercultural relations, marry non-Aibalians, provided the partner understands that it would hurt their friends to be monogamyious prior to the ceramony. A few Aibalian Elves like the idea of marrage, but will be hesatent to mention it as this is seen as a form of sexual deviency... Unless it's something they see as a way to lable somone as a "Super Bestie!" in which case they are typicaly fully supported by their entire caravan.</p>
        <p>As a downside, this does mean most Aibalian Elves attach physical attraction to the prerecusites for friendship. This can make it quite hard for Aibalians who do not meet the elven beauty standards to make friends. If a poor girl is meerly "hot for a human", she's probably screwed in terms of a scocial life. Bizzarly, Aibalian Elves find humans attractive despite using human as a semi-perjorative when talking about each other. Infact, they find most species, sexes, and genders attactive. Just not eachotehr when one of their number is a little "too human looking". Most people believe this to be a sort of uncanny valley effect.</p>
        <p>Asside from their cultural notions of beauty and fashion, Aibalian Elves are very notable for their incredibly bizzare <a href="#popup-box1">Elven dialect "Ulvam"</a>, which uses a ton of barrowed words from trade languages, human languages, and evlish, along with incredibly dence slang to create something that's recognisably Elvish, but borderline incomprehencable to elven speakers. A translitterated sample of a common elven poem follows:</p>
        <div class="textbox">
          <div class="row">
           <div class="column">
             <p>In western lands beneath the Sun</br>
               In spring, flowers rise,</br>
               The trees bud, waters run,</br>
               And the merry little birds sing.</br>
               </br>
               There it is cloudless night</br>
               And shuddering beeches hold</br>
               The starry host, the white jewels,</br>
               On their branching hair.</br>
               </br>
               Here at my path's end I am lingering</br>
               In deep darkness buried.</br>
               Beyond towers strong and high</br>
               Beyond all mountains steep</br>
               </br>
               Above all shadows rides the Sun</br>
               And stars always dwell.</br>
               I will not say 'The day is done'</br>
               Or to the stars 'farewell'.</p>
             </div>
           <div class="column" style="font-size: 0.9em;">
             <p>In the wild west, where the Sun's like, doing its thing, right?</br>
             Spring pops up with flowers, trees go like, "Hey!" all full of delight.</br>
             Little birdies are like, "Tweet, tweet, tweet!" in the air,</br>
             It's total happiness, you know, with a vibe that's so rare.</br>
             </br>
             And then, like, there's this night without a cloud in sight,</br>
             Beeches are shivering, holding the stars so tight.</br>
             Jewels are sparkling, in their hair so divine,</br>
             It's like, a cosmic party, totally out of line.</br>
             </br>
             So here I am, like, at the end of my path, feeling the deep dark,</br>
             Beyond mega towers and mountains, making a remark.</br>
             Above the shadows, the Sun's on a cool ride,</br>
             And stars are, like, always chillin', nowhere to hide.</br>
             </br>
             I won't be all, "The day is done," or tell stars, "bye-bye,"</br>
             I'm just gonna vibe with the cosmic sky.</p>

        <p>Aibalians have a unique musical styling which they claim is very evocative of the sea. It is best caracterised by its use of reverb-heavy strig instriuments (typicaly guitars) played to evoke the sound of crashing waves, overlaied with rapid softer strings and a matching fastpaced beat, featuring elements drawn from the msuical stylings of desert cultures thrown in seemingly out of lost tradition. It is designed to be playable in its entirity by small groups of eight people or less, with four being more than enough to complete the core arround which others simply add "flair".</p>
        <p>The musical style is very old, and indicates the Aibalians first arose in a costal region, though this has not been proven or corberated. A popular song in the Aibalian style can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/mKpsuGMeqHI?list=RDEMQZX7oBrvEdVCaacWBxreEA" target=”_blank” >here</a>.</p>
      <h2>Unique Abilities</h2>
        <p>Aibalian Elves have two unique abilities. The first is their version of the Elven Magical blessing, immunity to discomfort caused by nature. They are always a comfortable tempature, they do not feel pain if walkin gbarefoot no matter what sufice they might stride uppon. They are not bothered by getting wet in the rain, mud and grime simply dosn't coat them unless they wish it to. There is nothing at all in nature from climate, weather, or biome which can negativly impact an Aibalian Elf. Except, fo course, for animals, monsters, and other intelegent acting creatures.</p>
        <p>Bugs still bite them. Preditors will still talk them. Prey runs from them. Carniverious plants lust for their flesh as much as that of others. A long fall will still break their legs. It is simply the land itself and the weather which cannot bring them harm, discomfort, or distress.</p>
        <p>The other ability is quite odd and seemingly unique. An Aibalian Elf can tell if a creature is sapient, an adult for its species, and friendly, simply by being near it. This sence is never incorrect, but cannot impart negative information. The elf simply knows that either it is a friendly adult person, or that one or more of those conditions are untrue.</p>

            <p>The Aibalian Elvish dialect has these main habits: nasal sound; fast-paced run-on sentences; breathiness; uptalk, or the sound of a question; and vocal fry. “Uptalk” is an Aibalian term for its vast stable of slang terms including:</p>

        <p>Sarah Wildrose is a goblen adventurer active in the <a href="boundlessvale.html">Boundless Vale</a>, most known for slaying <a href="#popup-box4">the brughirn</a>. Sarah is an unconventional adventurer, as she quests not for fame nor her own fortune but rather in search of a list of spcific items. Said items are not parts of some lost treasure, nor a powerful set of armor scattered across the lands. Rather, Sarah appears to be adventuring to locate a "wish list" of sorts, that she might supply her family and friends with magic items that solve problems specific to them, or suit a particualr desire.</p>
      <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Sarah was born to an unknown goblin tribe some time durring <a href="#popup-box5">Frostbane</a> and discovered abandoned atop a frozen lake by the <a href="#popup-box1">Mala Caravan</a>. After some deliberation by the Caravan's clans, Sarah was adopted by Clan Wildrose. She was raised as one of their own, with only physical diffrences such as stature limitations taken into account. She was taught her clan's masgic, partisiapted in all aspects of their community equaly, and was even granted her adoptive people's natural magics as a boon by their shaman.</p>
        <p>She spent much of her youngest years assisting the shaman in her duities, learning the basics of simple magic in the process. By the time she was 12, Sarah was an acomplished apprentice mage and adept enough to create simple magical items on her own and to assist in the creation of greater works. As a thank you for her years of work, the shamen assisted Sarah in accuiring a familure. The namless magical beast is never far from Sarah's side, always there to <s>annoy</s> help. Sarah calls the creature <a href="#popup-box6">Bean</a>, a name which is ironic to her, but certainly is to everyone else.</p>
        <p>When Sarah came of age she discovered her unique magical talent of conjuring bladed weapons made of pure magical energy. She excitedly enrolled in the Caravan's militia to make the best use of her power but was swiftly rejected as her manifested weapons were too dangerious to practice with and she could not safly spar against people twice her size without them. Distraught by this reversal of fortune, Sarah angrily stormed off into the nearby forest to sulk. There she saved one of the Caravan's herbalists from a rock drake, and elected to train hard and become an adventurer to help people full time.</p>
        <p>Whil her parents resisted her career plans for several years, Sarah was able to find a mentor in the Caravan's elderly population. The retired tomb raider Nem Yhi saw potential in Sarah's unique abilities and indominable spirit and taught her the basics of the adventurer's trade.</p>
      <h2>Career</h2>
        <figure class="figure-left" style="width: 33%;">
          <img class="textimage"  src="./img/SarahMagic.webp" alt="Sarah at work.">
          <figcaption>Sarah at work.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When Sarah began her adventuring career it was not for the traditional reasons. Sarah is very devoted to, and loving of, her Caravan and adventurers for their sake. Her stated goal is to find a special item that's just right for all 384 people living in her Caravan, and to make as much of a fortune as she possibly can, all for their sake. To this end she keeps a large book on her at all times, in which are the names, likes, dislikes, wants, and needs of each and every last person back home. She made the book herself before setting out on her career, and duitifuly checks off names within the book when she finds a suitable gift for them.</p>
        <p>Sarah's goal is facilitated by a few magical items of her own, things she has made with her own two hands. The first is a poutch she wears on a theigh which can contain practicaly infinite ammounts of goods. It is predominatly filled with lovingly wrapped and labled gifts, which range from powerful magical weapons to tiny trinkets like eyeglasses that allow one to see their friends even when they are far away.</p>
        <p>Sarah is quite new to adventuring. Her greatest deed known to the general public is slaying the brughirn, though she has been a part of several other larger events. These include the Lost Library Expedition, the Elemental Nexus Crisis, and if Sarah is to be believed, saved the Barony of Veloria from the nightmare known as Ebbon non violently, though its subsequent slaying by the adventurer Keith Keithson makes this impossible to prove.</p>
      <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Sarah is a boisterious and fun loving person. She is very typical for her adoptive people. This makes her a particuarly lewd and crass woman by the standards of most cultures. This is best exemplified by her refusal to wear pants, skirts, or bottoms of any kind. While happy to wear a cloak to fully cover herself if nessisary, Sarah, being a goblin raised by Albalian Elves, sees covering herself as rude and exclusinary. In her own words "Implying I wouldn't sleep with them if they asked for relif would be way more mean!"</p>
        <p>This has caused her some complications in her career, as more wealthy and eliet patrons simply wont hire her due to a percieved lack of etticuite. This is an understandable assumption given how she acts and her biological ancestory. Goblins have reputations for being simple, priimitive, barbaric, and uncooth.</p>
        <p>Unfortuantly for Sarah, her goblen ancestory does influence her quite a bit. Other goblins call her a "loot goblin" due to her drive for treasure. They don't udnerstand she is questing for others rather than herself. Such charity and kindness is well within Goblin culture, but they cannot understand making that one's calling in life. Sarah self describes as a "cum cow" when asked how she would rank amongst her people. The crass name being the title given to a goblin tribe's designated harlot. Sarah explains it as she's happiest making others happy, physicaly or emotionaly.</p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Sarah is a short round goblin woman. She appears much more well groomed, healthy, and vibrant than her biological kin due to the influence of her adoptive parents. She is a prime represntative of what a good diet, food security, and knolage of soap could do for goblinkind.</p>
        <p>Her hair is black, and grows longer to one side of her head than the other, which she masks with an asymetrical haircut. Her skin is yellow green, and speckled with small bits gold "freckles" across her entire body. They appear to be metalic as they glitter a little in the light, but are entirly organic. She complements the gold glittering with gold jewlry including many piercings in her right ear (but only her right ear), bracelets, foot chains, and a snake shaped arm band.</p>
        <p>Her eyes are hazle, but often appear black due to her nicicating membraines. Like all goblins she is short in stature, with limbs notably shorter than a human's. She's fairly plump, with an exceptionaly large chest and soft pudgy belly. She often smiles.</p>
        <p>Sarah is a herm, posessing a full set of both male and female reproductive organs. Her sex is not natural, but was magicaly and ireevocably granted to her by her adoptive clan as she felt distress not being like her parents and friends. Her shaft's natural color is the same green as her skin, howeaver she had 95% of her member tattooed brown and pink to match her adoptive species norms. Her glans remains green as it hurt too much to tatoo.</p>
        <p>While her masculine parts are typicaly equivilent to a shetland pony's in scale, she can greatly increace her size through magic, and will do so on request. Not only by those who which her to top and have a love for the large, but also for those who think it would be cute for her to be so endowed while on bottom.</p>

      <h2>Equipment and Abilities</h2>
        <p>Sarah has a short list of known abilities, be they antural, arcane, or rooted in items and equipment she has access too.</p>
        <h3>Abilities</h3>
        <div class="indent">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Summon Psychic Blades -</b> Sarah can conjure a large number of bladed weapons composed of magical energy and her own willpower. These weapons appear out of thin air as shimmering blades of purple light with black handles / shafts and gold ornimentaion. She prefers to create daggers and double-edged glaves with cruciform guards. She can make a dozen of these at once, whield them telekenticaly for up to five minutes. She can create up to two weapons to wield in her hands with seemingly no durration. With only two weapons created, she can pass one to somone else to use, though it will dissipate after ten minutes. These weapons act like conventional weapons of their type in every way, save they can harm entities which are invulnerable to mortal weapons and slice through katanas (but only katanas) due to Sarah's extreem hatred of people who insist the katana is the ultimant sword. She has attempted to harnice her anger to make the blades more effective but to no avail (the hate must be pure and genuine).</li>

It is capable of negating most attacks provided they are of average strength or below. More powerful blows must destroy the energy field as it it were a physical object before the wearer can be harmed. If the field is destroied, the bracelet must be bathed in moonlight before the field can be restored. Note: The field can be damaged as per normal while the bracelet is exposed to moonlight, except on a night with a full moon and a prefectly clear sky (in which case the field takes a fraction of the harm it should, and rapidly repairs itself) and durring lunar eclipses (durring which the field is indistructable).</li>

She refuses to use this abilty on her nose, ears, tearducts, etc, but could. Technicaly. Everything else is free game... on request.</li>
                      <li><i>Species Concious Womb Adaptation -</i> Automaticaly configurers her womb (alternativly her colon, bladder, and/or prostate depending on what is being penatrated) to safly house whatever type of embryo, eggs, and/or larval creatures are being implanted within her for the durration of whatever pregnancy is required for their development and delivery. Also converts birth pain to pleasure and makes her various holes much more stretchy.</li>
                      <li><i>Erection Control -</i> Gives her manual control over her member, letting her choose when and for how long she's soft or hard, and to what degree.</li>
                      <li><i>Clean Convienance -</i> This enchantment makes the wearer's body break down all substances it consumes entirly, such that they produce no solid or liquid waste. While the intent was to keep herself clean for partners into anal, Sarah has enjoied not needing to stop doing whatever she was doing to use the bathroom.</li>
                      <li><i>Big Girl Mode! -</i> Increaces the size of her malehood and capasity of her vagina, anus, and throat to match that of a large warhorse. For brave bottoms and tops who like their bottoms silly oversized and very very messmakey! (Can be left on at all times, and she would, if she found a mate who wanted that.)</li>
                      <li><i>Messy Mode! -</i> If activated, Sarah's male and female ejaculations produce a volume of fluid directly preportional to how much her current partner thinks would be sexy, even if biologicaly impossible, up to the point of filling a five gallon bucket per orgasm (more is possible with the magic in question, but Sarah would rather get to round two within 5 minutes, and the large the volume, the more time she spends squirming and pumping.). Averages the volume produced if multiple partners are in play.</li>
                      <li><i>Belly Ride Mode! -</i> Allows for her vagina or anus to be penatrated safly wether or not she is arroused, and magicaly renforces its structure, allowing her to be suspended by an object incerted into her comfortably and happily for any length of time.

                    </ul>
                  <li><b>Ball stretcher -</b> Created by Sarah, this item serves a single but critical fucntion. It makes her balls soft and squishable, rather than hard and very very sensative to pain. This ensures her large endowment dosnt cause her distress but rather pleasure if accidently sat on, struck, poked, etc. The pleasure created and general feel of her orbs are identicle to that of her breasts. This item cannot be removed unless Sarah wills it.</li>
                  <li><b>Clit Ring -</b> A simpel gold ring created by Sarah personaly. It's effect is very simple and specific, anyone she's currently having sex with wont get tired, exausted, hungry, thirsty, or need to use the bathroom (this includes herself, both with a partner and when masteraiting). This allows any sex she has to continue for as long as everyone involves wants. It also creates a strong compulshion to cuddle her for at least 15 minutes afterwards (this effect has never been nessisary).</li>
                  <li><b>Earrings -</b> Sarah wears eight simple gold earrings, each of which is enchanted diffrently.</li>

                      <li><i>Ruby Ring -</i> While not made or ruby (indeed, all of her items are gold) the ring is able to teleport Sarah and up to 2 friends (and their stuff, animal companions, etc.) between two very specific points. Wherever it was last activated, and her <a href="#popup-box8">vardo</a> which is being kept with her Caravan. The ring can be used 3 times a day if taking passanges, or 6 times a day if its only her. While it normaly deposites guests outside there is an emergancy "TO THE BED!" function.</li>
                      <li><i>Hawk's Boon -</i> Allows the user to fly for up to 9 hours at 10x the speed they could run. Must remain inactive for twice as long as it was active for between uses.</li>
                      <li><i>Girl's Night -</i> This simple good hoop can be called uppon to inform the wearer of the nearest restraunt, tavern, spa, arena, market, fair, and other notewothly locations within a city-sized area where two or more people could have a nice date, good time with friends, or just an evening's fun. If there are none, it will attempt to direct them to local attractions instead. If there are none, it points them in the direction of the nearest town.</li>
                      <li><i>Monster F--riend's Band -</i> Magicaly ensures all monsterious creatures encountered which are not allready in a rage interact as nicly as possible to the wearer. Can result in monsters attempting to mate with the wearer. Typicaly allows an adventurer to fall back and plan.</li>
                      <li><i>Familiar's Nest -</i> This ring allows Sarah to transform her familure into a tatoo located somewhere on her body, and then back into a flesh and blood creature. It can be used at will though Sarah cannot choose where the tattoo goes nor what pose it will be in. Bean prefers to be a tramp stamp, though also enjoies being a womb tattoo, full back spread, and sleeve, though he will go anywhere he likes.</li>
                      <li><i>Emergancy Potion -</i> This ring can be touched to a particular potion, and attuned to it. Once attuned, the potion will be automaticaly teleported into Sarah's stumoch when a condition set durring the atunment is met. It is typicaly attoned to a healing potion with the condition of "I am dying."</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Magic Poutch -</b> Sarah's poutch is bottomless, and always has the item she wants on top. Anything up to the size of a small wagon can fit through the opening. It is safe for living creatures to exist within the extradimentional space, through it is quite cold (to preserve food) and lightless. An enchantment uppon it she is unaware of informes those who open it without premission that they are opening a container that contains a gift for a dragon. This last effect was placed on the bag by her Caravan's shaman, who happens to be a dragoness. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Note:</b> Despite the rest of her daily wear jewlry being enchanted, Sarah's nipple rings are not. She's saving them for things her mate might want, be they practical, fun, or lewd. It is important to note hwoeaver that ALL of her piercing <i>holes</i> are enchanted with her Caravan's traidmark "Structuraly Relevent" enchantment, which allows her to be safly, easily, and painlessly hoisted, manipulated, or even hung from any of her piercings without any harm to her or much effort on the part of whoeaver is manipulating her via the piercings in said holes, or any imeadiatly attached item such as a chain, hook, rope, etc.</p>
            <p>Conversly she can use them as attachment points to carry items with the same comfort and convienance. These spells are extreemly well refined and developed due to her Caravan having an exceptionaly high percentage of BDSM enthusiests, and as such Sarah dosn't even mind being hung upside down by her clit ring as the magic makes it not only comfortable, but enjoyable (She once bunjee jumped with the rope attached to that same piercing to prove a point to a friend, and was fine.).</p>

            <p>The Sutetu Valley is a small region in upper Gynerium accessed through the elven controlled Xivric pass. It is best known for having the highest population of Limax in the known world and the river Tsnem. The river is famious for flooding on or near the day of the full moon, easily doubling its flow rate and widening by 4-5 meters.</p>
            <p>The source of the river's flooding is related to a semi-dormant volcano which exerts pressure on a vast aquafer once every 27-32 days. The pressure forces water to the surfice, bubbling out of the many extinct volcano crators in the valley's surrounding mountains. The water then flows down the usual runoff paths, flooding the river.</p>

          <h1>The Brughirn</h1>
          <div class="center">
            <p>The brughirn was a ethereal creature with shimmering, iridescent scales that ripple like the surface of a pond reflecting the moonlight. Its form blended serpentine grace, avian elegance, and otherworldly menace into a single large beast. The brughirn possessed a mesmerizing allure, drawing unsuspecting victims to their fate with endless nightmears.</p>
            <p>The brughirn terrorised the village of Eldoria, a small but wealthy community in the north of the Boundless Vale. The brughirn would infiltrate the sleeping minds of the villagers, weaving illusions that intertwined with their deepest desires and fears. The dreams would inevetably drive the villagers to attempt to kill the monster, overestimating their abilities due to sleep depervation, terror, and potentialy even magical fogging of the mind. The village hired many adventurers to put an end to the brughirn, but stopped after a dozen fell to its fangs.</p>
            <p>Unable to ensure the village's safty, people began to flee. Eldoria began to wither away, threatening the balance of power in the region as its many ranches and copper mine could no longer find enough workers.</p>
            <p>The monster met its end when the previously unhread of Adventurer Sarah Wildrose came to Eldoria to resupply. Hearing of the brughirn in hushed whispers, the young adventurer elected to hunt the beast. She was able to find its lair deep in the nearby forest, in a cave beneath an old rotten willow tree. The bones and kits of a dozen previous adventurers littered the brughirn's lair, yet Sarah persisted.</p>
            <p>While the brughirn was immune to weapons forged by man, Sarah fought with weapons manifested through magic by her force of will alone. As her weapons held no substance of the earth in them, they easily pierced the monster's hide, rending its flesh and spilling its blood. The brughirn had no experiance fighting a foe which could hurt it, and attempted to flee in short order. Sarah tracked it, backed it into a cornor as any hunter would any prey, and slew it.</p>
            <p>Sarah returned the brughirn's head to the village. It was stuffed and mounted and is currently on display at the Maiden's Rest, a lodge on the outskirts of Eldoria.</p>

          <h1>Frostbane</h1>
          <div class="center">
            <p>Frostbane, a name whispered with trepidation, was an exceptionaly harsh winter of relentless ice and biting winds that gripped the Boundless Vale with an unprecedented ferocity. During Frostbane, the Boundless Vale became a frozen tableau of desolation. The once verdant landscapes were encased in thick layers of frost, transforming the lush meadows and towering forests into a haunting ice-sculpted wilderness. The normally resilient flora succumbed to the icy grasp, leaving skeletal remnants of once-thriving ecosystems.</p>
            <p>The frigid winds carried tales of hardship as communities grappled with scarcity and isolation. Trade routes became perilous, and communication between settlements was severed by the merciless winter storms. The Boundless Vale's inhabitants, known for their resilience, found themselves facing challenges that tested the very core of their survival instincts.</p>
            <p>Yet, amid the harshness of Frostbane, narratives of camaraderie and unwavering determination emerged. Tales of daring quests for vital resources, mythical creatures surfacing in search of refuge, and alliances formed in the face of adversity became the threads woven into the tapestry of this unforgettable winter.</p>
            <p>Frostbane, with its icy grip and tales of endurance, remains etched in the chronicles of the Boundless Vale—a testament to the indomitable spirit of those who weathered its frozen embrace and emerged stronger, forever shaping the history of the Vale.</p>

              <figcaption>Sarah's Vardo.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>A Vardo <i>(also Gypsy wag(g)on, living wagon, caravan, van and house-on-wheels)</i> is a four-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle used by many diffrent migrant cultures as their home. It is pulled by a single beast of burdern (typicaly a horse), sometimes with a second to help pull heavier loads or assist in pulling up a hill. The vehicle is typically highly decorated, intricately carved, brightly painted, and even gilded. The traveller tradition of the vardo is seen as a high cultural point of both artistic design and a masterpiece of woodcrafter's art.</p>
            <p>A vardo's design includes large wheels set outside the body, whose sides slope outward considerably as they rise toward the eaves. Beyond this characteristic, the six types of caravans differ in shape, size, placement of the wheels relative to the bed, where made, and maker. The roofs of the bow-top and open-lot types are canvas stretched over curved wooden frames; the others are roofed in wood. By the middle of the Age of Craftsmen, the designs were almost entirely standardized, and some features are common to all types.</p>
            <p>A small cast-iron cooking stove is a common fixture of the wagons. A cooking stove necessitates a chimney to vent smoke. A vardo's chimney is always on its left side as viewed from its front doorway; as the caravan travels along the left side of the road, the chimney is in less danger from low-hanging tree limbs in that position. The stove rests in a wooden fireplace.</p>
            <p>The wagon's interior is typically outfitted with built-in seats, cabinets, a wardrobe, bunks in the rear of the caravan, a chest of drawers, and a glass-fronted china cabinet. There are windows on the left side and rear. Some types have clerestories which let in light and air. A bracket for an oil lamp is mounted over the chest of drawers opposite the fireplace; the chest's top functions as a table. Wagons' exteriors can range from fairly plain to intricately carved, painted in bright colours, and sheathed in places with gold leaf. </p>

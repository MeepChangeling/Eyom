          <h1>Willow Creek, California</h1>
        	<p><strong>Willow Creek</strong> (formerly <strong>China Flat</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census-designated_place" title="Census-designated place">census-designated place</a> (CDP) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_County,_California" title="Humboldt County, California">Humboldt County</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, United States. The population was 1,710 at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_Census" title="2010 United States Census">2010 census</a>, down from 1,743 at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_Census" title="2000 United States Census">2000 census</a>. Residents of this small mountain town are commonly referred to as &quot;Willow Creekers.&quot; The town is located around 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) from county seat and harbor city <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka,_CA" title="Eureka, CA">Eureka</a>, with the two places vastly differing in climate.</p>

        	<p>Unbeknownst to the public, Willow Creek has become a vital sanctuary for magical creatures and individuals, strategically overseen by the Mythic Response Unit (MRU) under the Department of Arcana. There is some jurisdictional conflicts with the MiB, as Willow Creek's charter's language expressly includes extraterrestrials within the list of protected individuals. ETs within Willow Creek's registration are therefore the jurisdiction of the MRU, preventing the MiB from taking action against them without formal permission. Permission is rarely granted due to the thorny history shared by the two agencies.</p>

        	<p>Willow Creek stands as a testament to the MRU's ability to integrate magic into the fabric of ordinary life. Agents should approach their duties in Willow Creek with discretion, understanding that the town's charm and allure are essential components of the ongoing mission to ensure the peaceful coexistence of magical beings and the human world.</p>

        	<p>Willow Creek sits along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_River_(California)" title="Trinity River (California)">Trinity River</a>. Willow Creek is described as a &quot;rugged mountain community nestled in the heart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Rivers_National_Forest" title="Six Rivers National Forest">Six Rivers National Forest</a>.&quot; This area of California is located in the Trinity/Shasta/Cascade Region, near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> border, and is easily reached via State Routes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_299" title="California State Route 299">299</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_96" title="California State Route 96">96</a> (the &quot;Bigfoot Scenic Byway&quot;).</p>

        	<p>The town is approximately 50 miles south of where the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterson-Gimlin_film" title="Patterson-Gimlin film">Patterson-Gimlin film</a> was made. Willow creek calls itself the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> capital of the world, has a Bigfoot Museum and holds an annual &quot;Bigfoot Daze&quot; festival in September in honor of the creature, followed by various festivities in a local park. The roadhead of the Bluff Creek / Fish Lake Road, near which many alleged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> sightings and footprint finds occurred, is about 30 miles north, along Route <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_96" title="California State Route 96">96</a>.</p>

        	<p>An Amazon reviewer of the 2013 <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Found_footage_(pseudo-documentary)" title="Found footage (pseudo-documentary)">found-footage</a> horror film, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Creek_(film)" title="Willow Creek (film)">Willow Creek</a>,</em> says, &quot;The endearing quirkiness of the town is captured very well in the iconography, the interviews (particularly with Steven S., the bookstore owner), and the food.&quot; The Wikipedia review says, &quot;The two stop off first in Willow Creek ... where various locals talk to Jim&#39;s camera, warning them to keep out of the woods, singing ballads about Bigfoot, and generally enjoying their 15 minutes in the spotlight while Jim and Kelly have a blast ....&quot;</p>

        	<p>Willow Creek was served for many decades by the weekly <em>Klamity Kourier</em> newspaper, which closed in 2006 and was quickly replaced by the <a class="external text" href="http://www.harvestmccampbell.com/BigfootValleyNews.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Bigfoot Valley News</em></a>. The <em>Bigfoot Valley News</em> has since closed, but the regional newspaper, <em>Two Rivers Tribune</em> (www.tworiverstribune.com), opened in 1994 and is still going strong. Its news coverage area is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnt_Ranch,_California" title="Burnt Ranch, California">Burnt Ranch</a> to <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Camp,_CA" title="Happy Camp, CA">Happy Camp</a>, 97.5 miles (by Routes 299 and 96) to the north.</p>

        	<h2>Geography</h2>
        	<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the CDP has a total area of 30.6 square miles (79&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), which include 30.3 square miles (78&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land and 0.3 square miles (0.78&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of water.</p>

        	<p>The CDP in 2000, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, was larger with a total area of 204.5 square miles (530&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), which included 204.4 square miles (529&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land and 0.2 square miles (0.52&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of water.</p>

        	<p>Surrounded by dense forests and bordered by the Trinity River, Willow Creek's natural beauty conceals a secret haven for mystical beings. Agents should be aware that the town's geography plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance between the magical and mundane. Care must be taken to maintain the relationships between the town and the spirits of the land, lest they decide to cease assisting with the concealment of the town's mythical residents, flora, and fauna.</p>

        	<h3>Climate</h3>
        	<p>This region experiences much warmer summers than locations near the coast, such as county seat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka,_California#Climate" title="Eureka, California">Eureka</a>, but retains high winter rainfall associated with coastal locations. Daytime highs in summer represent areas with hot-summer-Mediterranean climates but are moderated by cool nights, causing high <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_variation" title="Diurnal temperature variation">diurnal temperature variation</a>. On climate maps, Willow Creek has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate#Hot-summer_Mediterranean_climate" title="Mediterranean climate">hot-summer Mediterranean climate</a> (Csa).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Creek,_California#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Summer highs are extremely hot compared to areas of the county affected by coastal fog. At the same time, winters are considerably colder, with light snowfall not unusual a few times per season.</p>

        	<h2>History</h2>
        	<p>The indigenous people from here are part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsnungwe" title="Tsnungwe">Tsnungwe</a> or South Fork Hupa and are speakers of the Hupa Language. Willow Creek&#39;s first non-indigenous settlers were Chinese laborers from the mining and lumber camps, which earned the town the name China Flat. The China Flat post office opened in 1878, and changed its name to Willow Creek in 1915.</p>
          	<h3>Early Settlement and Indigenous Roots</h3>
          	<p>Long before the arrival of non-indigenous settlers, the land now known as Willow Creek was inhabited by the Tsnungwe, specifically the South Fork Hupa, who were the indigenous people of the region. They were speakers of the Hupa Language, and their presence and influence on the area's culture and landscape laid the foundation for the town's later development.</p>
          	<h3>Chinese Laborers and the Mining Era</h3>
          	<p>In the late 19th century, the landscape of Willow Creek began to transform with the arrival of Chinese laborers. Drawn by opportunities in mining and lumber camps, these early settlers played a crucial role in shaping the town's identity. Their presence led to the town being colloquially referred to as China Flat, reflecting the significant influence of the Chinese community in the area.</p>
          	<h3>China Flat Post Office and the Evolution to Willow Creek</h3>
          	<p>Formalizing its existence, the China Flat post office was established in 1878, marking a milestone in the town's history. However, the town underwent a notable change in 1915 when it officially adopted the name Willow Creek. This change was emblematic of a shift in identity, possibly influenced by the natural surroundings, specifically the proximity to the Trinity River and the lush willow trees that graced the landscape.</p>
          	<h3>Transformation and Integration</h3>
          	<p>As the town underwent this transformation, its mystical potential began to emerge. The rich cultural heritage of the indigenous Tsnungwe people and the blending of diverse influences, including those of the Chinese laborers, set the stage for a unique convergence of energies in Willow Creek.</p>
          	<h3>Integration of Magic</h3>
          	<p>Unbeknownst to the early settlers, the convergence of energies in Willow Creek attracted magical beings, establishing the town as a sanctuary for mystical creatures. Over the years, as the Department of Arcana and the Mythic Response Unit established their presence, Willow Creek evolved into a harmonious haven where the magical and the mundane coexist.</p>
          	<h3>Today's Willow Creek</h3>
          	<p>Modern-day Willow Creek remains deeply rooted in its history, with nods to its indigenous heritage and the contributions of the Chinese laborers. However, beneath the surface, the town is a carefully maintained sanctuary, where the mystical and the ordinary seamlessly intertwine, thanks to the discreet efforts of the Department of Arcana and the vigilant agents of the MRU.</p>

        	<h2>Demographics</h2>
        	<p>Precice demographic figures for Willow Creek are impractical for record keeping due to many reasons, including the presence of several non-hostile demons whose names and numbers cannot be recorded as per the Treaty of Gehena. The following list is presented in order from greatest to least, with humans and various anthropoid species making up 78% of the town's population.</p>

        	<h3>Humans</h3>
        	<p>The majority of Willow Creek's population consists of ordinary humans, unaware of the magical beings coexisting with them. They contribute to the town's daily life, businesses, and cultural events, and are aware of the town's mystical undercurrents. Locals are not to be ignored on arcane matters and serve as the first line of reporting for the agency.</p>
        	<h3>Anthropoids</h3>
        	<p>Willow Creek is home to a diverse community of Anthropoids, contributing to the town's vibrant atmosphere. Due to the human habitants' heightened tolerance of non-humans, there are about equal numbers of humans and anthropoids in Willow Creek at any given time.</p>
        	<h3>Indigenous Tsnungwe (South Fork Hupa)</h3>
        	<p>The descendants of the indigenous Tsnungwe people continue to have a presence in Willow Creek. They contribute to the town's cultural richness, maintaining a connection to the ancient energies of the land. Several of their number are Shamen, memorizing their names, faces, and duties is required for all MRU Agents assigned to Willow Creek. Tsnungwe Shamen hold the honorary rank of Captain within the MRU's rank structure to ensure the completion of their rights, rituals, and duties.</p>
        	<h3>Elemental Kin</h3>
        	<p>Due to the actions of a Chinese mage during the construction of the railroad, descendants of the early Chinese laborers who settled in Willow Creek possess a unique connection to elemental magic. This connection appears in the most recent generation in individuals who are only 1/8th Chinese by ancestry. They can sense and manipulate one or more of the classical elements (fire, earth, water, air) in various small ways. A few can perform more drastic feats. See File WC-CA-08: Elemental Kin for details.</p>
        	<h3>Fey Residents</h3>
        	<p>Autumn, Spring, and Winter fey folk have found a haven in Willow Creek. Pixies, sprites, and other fae beings are drawn to the town's natural beauty, adding a touch of magic to the flora and fauna. An existing contract with Oberon keeps most of their less savory and dangerous trickery off the table for Willow Creek residents. Tourists are fair game under this contract.</p>
        	<h3>Shapeshifters</h3>
        	<p>Willow Creek attracts shapeshifters from various backgrounds, including werewolves and skinwalkers. These beings seamlessly blend in with the human population, maintaining a careful balance between their true nature and the mundane world. Werewolves are to be monitored but tolerated. Skinwalkers, if identified, are to be reported to the Beuro of Indian Affairs Spirit Division. Extermination will be handled by the SD.</p>
        	<h3>Elemental Spirits</h3>
        	<p>Spirits embodying the elements, such as water nymphs, fire spirits, and earth elementals,	find solace in the town's surroundings. They contribute to the town's mystical structures, subtly influencing the natural world. Their most pronounced impact is on Arcana. Mages are to be briefed on their presence and activities using File WC-CA-02: Elemental Spirit Distribution</p>
        	<h3>Fiends</h3>
        	<p>Several demons who surrendered during the Battle of Ghenna have been placed in witness protection. A number of them reside in Willow Creek. Agents are to be briefed on their names and numbers only if added to their protection detail.</p>
        	<h3>Celestial Beings</h3>
        	<p>Beings from the celestial realms, including angels and benevolent spirits, may be drawn to Willow Creek. They often play a role in maintaining the town's protective enchantments and ensuring the well-being of its inhabitants.</p>

        	<h2>MRU Operations</h2>
        	<h3>Local Collaborations</h3>
        	<p>To maintain the Veil, the MRU has cultivated close ties with local authorities, community leaders, and key figures within Willow Creek. These collaborations ensure the seamless integration of magical creatures into the community, with all locals sworn to secrecy and actively participating in the town's charade.</p>
        	<h3>Misinformation Campaign</h3>
        	<p>Agents should be aware of the ongoing misinformation campaign orchestrated by the MRU. Genuine sightings and supernatural occurrences are discreetly debunked as hoaxes, diverting public attention and reinforcing the town's association with the legendary Bigfoot. Agents are reminded there is no such thing as Big Foot.</p>
        	<h3>Community Events</h3>
        	<p>Willow Creek's annual festivals and events are organized by the Department of Arcana to celebrate the town's mythical reputation. These gatherings serve a dual purpose, diverting attention from genuine magical activities while reinforcing the belief that the supernatural is all in good fun. Some genuine rituals are preformed on these dates as well, disguised as part of the festivities.</p>
        	<h3>MRU Facilities</h3>
        	<p>Located discreetly on the outskirts of Willow Creek, the MRU's hidden base serves as a command center for monitoring mystical activities. Agents stationed here utilize enchanted communication devices, advanced surveillance equipment, and state-of-the-art technology to ensure the safety and secrecy of the town. Agents are hereby warned that the ET Samantha Lunethura is not to enter the base under any circumstances. This is for the protection of everyone involved. Should her medical services be required, they are to be obtained at another location.</p>
        	<h3>Emergency Response</h3>
        	<p>In the event of supernatural emergencies, the MRU swiftly intervenes to contain mystical incidents. Agents are trained to discreetly evacuate affected areas, neutralize threats, and collaborate with local emergency services to maintain the Veil. The use of neuralizers is permitted for tourists only.</p>
        	<h3>Ongoing Monitoring</h3>
        	<p>Agents stationed in Willow Creek should remain vigilant, as the town is a unique nexus of mystical energies. Regular surveillance and analysis of magical phenomena are crucial to adapting to the ever-changing dynamics of the mystical community.</p>

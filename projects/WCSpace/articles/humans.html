They are largely blind to their own progress; primarily due to flaws within their survival instincts which over prioritize negative information. But when studied objectively you can see their cruelty diminishes and the kindness which has always lived in their hearts grows. That kindness and compassion is a silver lining on their astonishingly robust cunning, imagination, and inventiveness. There are few species in this galaxy who could develop powered flight and land on their moon in the same century. There's only one who did it with liquid fueled "space craft," humans."</p>

      	<b>Skin:</b> Human skin is soft, smooth, typically covered in the vegestal remains of a fur coat (usually only visible on males). It comes in a spectrum of colors from dark brown to pale peach. Some humans have black skin resembling coal, while others have snow white skin. These are uncommon colors, yet most humans will claim to be white or black. This is cultural terminology rather than literal descriptions of color.<br>
      	<b>Hair:</b> Human hair exists in a variety of textures and color. The main aspects of hair texture are the curl pattern, volume, and consistency. Color wise, human hair can be blond, dark blond, medium brown, dark brown, black, reddish-brown, red, gray, or white. Gray and white hair is typically a sign of advanced age but can occur in younger individuals.<br>
      	<b>Eyes:</b> Human eyes consist of a white sclera, a colored iris, and a round black pupil. The iris can be many different colors, most of which are shades of brown, amber, hazel, green, blue, or gray. Some humans' eyes are different colors from each other. Albino humans' eyes are occasionally red or violet.<br>

    	<h4>Appearance</h4>
    	<p>Humans <i>(<a href="GalacticTaxonomicalClassificationSystem.html">GTCS</a>: Sapientia bipedia terrans bipedae dextera oculata Homo sapiens)</i> are a fairly plain looking species. They are descended from a species of QeH, best described as a member of the <i>ghIlab naHmey</i> classification. Their evolution is similar to the <a href="Gid.html">Gid</a>, baring of course the Gid's descent from a species of Huch rather than QeH (Both species categories are exceptionally similar and easily confused.). While their appearance is more varied than the Gid, they are still quite limited in morphology and coloration.</p>
  	<p>Human coloration and morphology depends entirely on their ethnic group, of which there are many. Humans currently recognise <span class="toggle-item">one thousand sixty five</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">1065</span> ethnic groups, but there are far fewer than <span class="toggle-item">one thousand sixty five</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">1065</span> unique appearance sets for these groupings. Unfortunately humans are extremely sensitive to ethnicity, an unfortunate taboo for those wishing to study their species. They can become extremely defensive or even aggressive if asked innocuous questions such as "Why do you call yourself black when you're brown?" or "I'm sorry, I can't see any difference between you. Can you please explain?". This trait is common to primitive species, and makes determining the standard human appearance far more difficult than it needs to be.</p>
  	<button id="raceButton" type="button" class="collapsible3">Race</button>
    	<div class="content">
    	<p>Humans have a social concept called "race", an identity created, often by socially dominant groups, to establish meaning in a social context. Different cultures define different racial groups, often focused on the largest groups of social relevance, and these definitions can change over time. This is the closest humans get to being willing to average their morphology and coloration into a standard appearance. Currently the races recognised by <a href="Earth.html">Earth's</a> dominant power are:</p>
    	<ul>
      	<li><b>American Indian</b> </li>
      	<li><b>Alaska Native</b> </li>
      	<li><b>Asian</b> </li>
      	<li><b>Black / African American</b> </li>
      	<li><b>Native Hawaiian</b> </li>
      	<li><b>Pacific Islander</b> </li>
      	<li><b>White / Caucasian</b> </li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>Despite two of these categories having colors in their names, it is considered immoral and unethical in most human cultures to define people by the color of their skin. Several wars in their recent history have involved genocide based on racial identities. Consequently describing any of these groups in detail might be considered offensive enough to cause hostilities, and therefore will be skipped. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
    	<p>Our only recommendation is to view human media until you pick up on the differences personally, or to talk with those who have.</p>

   	</div>
    	</div>
  	<p>While only slightly above average, the specific abilities in which humans scores are elevated imply great potential within the scientific, engineering, exploratory, and development fields.</p>

  	<h4>Mental Abilities</h4>
  	<p>Humans are currently presumed prefect in terms of adapting to and utilizing technology. Their score of <span class="toggle-item">twenty</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">20</span> could potentially be a <span class="toggle-item">nineteen</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">19</span> once more individuals take the test, but this seems unlikely. In either case, their ability to utilize technology and adapt to technology is either prefect, or nearly prefect.</p>
  	<p>In laymen's terms, this means humans are capable of truly insane technological feats for their <a href="GuidelinesForContact.html">development level</a> <i>(<span class="toggle-item">Cee Four</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">C4</span>)</i>. Examples include:</p>
  	<ul>
    	<li>Pre-nanomachine vaccinations and immunizations.</li>
    	<li>Silicone computer chips with a mere <span class="toggle-item">five</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">5</span>nm transistor size.</li>
    	<li>Landed on their moon and both neighboring planets using combustion powered spacecraft. A galactic first.</li>
    	<li>Adapting a natural bacteria's replication method to create a customizable (if crude) gene editing tool. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoczYXJeMY4">random human</a> unrelated to their academic institutions made use of it to cure a genetic condition, by their on will and machinations.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This occured less than seventy years after they discovered DNA exists, and within 25 years of mapping their genome.</li>
      </ul>
    	<li>Created <i>several</i> space stations. Using only combustion powered space craft. By hand. In space. Without so much as a hardsuit.</li>
    	<li>Created a rotary prop aircraft which functioned for several years on Sol IV.</li>
    	<li>Drove several diseases to extinction. Intentionally.</li>
    	<li>Created optical telescopes capable of taking images of objects hundreds of lightyears away.</li>
    	<li>Developed a functional global digital communications system before artificial intelligence. The system operates using an elaborate series of rules and an incomprehensible web of standards, yet almost never fails.</li>
    	<li>Have created multiple atomicly flat structures without the aid of force manipulator technology.</li>
    	<li>Fully mapped their species genome in only <span class="toggle-item">thirteen</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">13</span> years using computers most of us would assume couldn't so much as display text.</li>
    	<li>Have managed to create a crude approximation of AI by using basic machine learning to learn to imitate an aspect of sapience, and linking them together for added functionality.</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>All of these achievements are the result of humans ability to take seemingly unrelated technologies and apply them to new situations or with other technologies. They can use this simple principal to overcome a frankly ridiculous number of challenges. One need only look at how their primitive graphics systems handles lighting and shadows to see just how ridiculous and backwards humans can be... and yet their ideas work more often than not.</p>
  	<p>In addition to their potential perfection in terms of technological adaptation, their elevated scores in creative thinking, pattern recognition and analytical thinking allow humans to preform a feat of mental mastery which is the key behind everything else they have done. A group of humans (usually <span class="toggle-item">five to ten</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">5-10</span>) with similar interests can collaborate on a project and achieve a level of progress comparable to Class III AI systems.</p>
  	<p>A group of humans determined to solve a problem will almost certainly find a way to do so, provided they have the funding to preform their work. This ability has been endemic to their species since their paleolithic era. It is the reason why it took them a mere hundred years (by their calendar) to finish their industrial revolution. It is why it only took them sixty years to go from their first powered aircraft to landing on their moon. It is why if given middle school physics and engineering text books we expect humans could quickly solve any small to medium scale problem on any of our worlds.</p>
  	<p> Even their least educated and poorest individuals can and do make use of this ability, often to return complex equipment they do not fully understand to a working state using only scraps which happened to be at hand. At the highest levels, humans were recently able to create a vaccine for a brand new virus which had become a pandemic in less than a year. Under no circumstances should anyone underestimate the human ability to collaborate. It truly cannot be described in mere words.</p>


  	<h4>Mentality</h4>
  	<p>The most startling ability within the human species is their unique capacity for self-delusion. A human can convince itself it will succeed at something, or is in the right so completely they often find a way to win if the odds are not truly impossible. The downside being many humans cannot conceive of something being truly impossible and develop grudges or worldviews based on perceived mistreatment.</p>
  	<p>Humans are irrational. They act against each other's interests on every scale from interpersonal to international. They compete viciously and brutally (often through total war) for limited resources even if they do not need those resources. Their mere existence as limited can be enough to a human to warrant doing anything to possess them. This is due to humans high capacity for asperation, which is often driven by greed yes, but just as often by a sense of kinship.</p>
  	<p>Combine this with their species sense of compassion and ridiculous tolerance of adversity, and its little wonder why they act as if they can make it through any hardship for so long and so hard that they managed to actually find a way to do so. In simpler terms, humanity has weaponized delusion as a survival tool.</p>
  	<p>While most species within the galaxy have similar ideas of recreational activities (sports and the arts being seemingly universal), humans enjoy taking things to extremes. Human recreation includes and often emphasizes physical violence, intense mental competition, deliberate self poisoning, and in many cases deliberately placing themselves into lethal situations.Remember, humans current solution for space travel is placing their fragile bodies in a thin metal cylinder and flinging it into space using a controlled explosion. And it works.</p>
  	<p>While this could describe any primitive species at some point in its history, these traits have not only remained as humans have begun to globalize, but have expanded. A popular human sport is called base jumping, it involves scaling a tall object or suitable natural land feature and jumping off of it with only a thin cloth membrane to halt one's fall. Many humans have preserved their ancient martial arts not merely out of scholarly interest and cultural duty, but to make use of them in sporting competitions.</p>
  	<p>Even intellectually inclined humans appear to greatly enjoy danger as they have developed hybrid sports such as Chess Boxing (alternating rounds of a complex strategy game and brutal physical combat emphasizing blows to the head), amature rocketry (essentially the design and manufacture of explosives to send objects as high as possible), and competing for various records which require decades of expertise and dedicated teams... all to attempt to break the sound barrier in a wheeled vehicle.</p>
  	<p>Humans are amazingly self aware of this aspect of themselves. Their modern culture has created an entire category of jokes based on the idea of alien life meeting them and finding much of their behavior to be "batshit insane". They call it "<a href="https://cheezburger.com/11171333/tumblr-thread-humans-are-weird-durable-space-orcs">Humans are Space Orcs</a>" and little do they know, it's essentially correct. This genera of humor also includes observations on their self-contradictory behaviors and is a remarkable example of their mental abilities mixing with their philosophy and sense of self.</p>

  	<h4>Religion</h4>
  	<p>Humans are on average religious extremists (by galactic standards. By their own standards, only a small number of individuals are religious extremists. We could count those individuals as hyper extremists.). This is understandable as Earth happens to be a <a href="ShrineWorld.html">Class IX Shrine World</a>, with a resident population of <a href="extradimentionalentities.html">extradimentional entities</a> of Class III or higher numbering in the low tens of thousands humans were bound to develop strong religious beliefs and practices.</p>
  	<p>Interestingly despite Earth's status, humans are relatively insensitive to dimensional flux and have a low psionic potential. The reasons for this are unknown.</p>
  	<p>Religion has shaped human history in ways both constructive and destructive. On the positive side, religious institutions have often been the bedrock of community cohesion, offering social support, ethical guidelines, and a sense of belonging. They have inspired humans to create some of their most enduring works of art, literature, and architecture. The concepts of charity, justice, and human dignity often have roots in religious teachings, influencing laws and societal norms.</p>
  	<p>Moreover, religion has been a catalyst for scientific and philosophical inquiry. Many of humanity's early scholars were also religious figures who sought to understand the divine by exploring the natural world. The drive to comprehend the universe and humanity's place within it has propelled human innovation and led to discoveries that have benefitted all sentient life forms.</p>
  	<p>However, the influence of religion is not without its darker aspects. Throughout their history, humans have committed atrocities in the name of religion. Wars, persecution, and cultural destruction have often been justified by religious ideologies. These conflicts, while sometimes politically motivated, are frequently couched in religious terms, leading to long-standing divisions and suffering. Occasionally even permanent incompatibility between groups can arise from religious differences as simple and ancient as a succession dispute nearly one and a half millennia old. Religion has also been used to justify social inequalities, stifling progress and maintaining oppressive systems under the guise of divine will.</p>
  	<p>Wether or not these events are purely inventions of the human mind, or genuine orders from extra dimensional entities is a coin toss. Various clerics and monks have attempted to contact Earth's higher dimensions, but have been either unsuccessful, or only able to reach Class I or II entities, who lack the power necessary to matter enough to their society to have the answers we seek.</p>

  	<h4>Environs Typically Inhabited</h4>
  	<p data-augmented-ui="tl-2-clip-y tr-rect br-rect-x bl-2-clip-xy border" class="styleme quote" style="padding-bottom: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">We have obtained permission to use sections of "A Study of Homo sapiens' Survival Mechanisms in Varied Environments" by Doctor Tarum for this section. We believe his perspective illustrates the point far better than ours ever could.<br><span class="floatR">— Administration</span> </p>
  	<p>"Humans are an intriguing case study in survival. Unlike many species that are specialized to thrive in specific environments, humans exhibit a generalist approach. They lack the fur of polar animals, the water retention abilities of desert creatures, and the wings or gills of other planetary fauna. Yet, through a combination of biological plasticity, cultural innovation, and sheer willpower, they have managed to colonize nearly every terrestrial environment on their planet."</p>
  	<p>"Humans are primarily a tropical species, and their evolutionary roots in warmer climates are evident in their physiological responses to heat. The most significant adaptation is their ability to sweat profusely, a process known as evaporative cooling. This mechanism allows humans to regulate their core temperature even in environments where ambient temperatures exceed their normal body temperature (approximately 37°C). However, this adaptation comes at a cost: dehydration. In high heat environments, a human can lose several liters of water per day through sweat, necessitating a constant intake of fluids to avoid heatstroke and death."</p>
  	<p>"Inhabitants of arid regions such as the Sahara and the Arabian Peninsula have developed cultural practices that mitigate the effects of extreme heat. Clothing in these regions is typically loose and covers much of the body, reducing direct exposure to the sun while allowing air circulation to facilitate evaporative cooling. Furthermore, the timing of daily activities is often adjusted, with work and travel occurring during the cooler morning and evening hours, and rest taken during the midday heat.</p>
  	<p>The Bedouins, nomadic inhabitants of the Arabian deserts, exemplify human adaptation to extreme heat. Their knowledge of water sources, both permanent and seasonal, coupled with their use of camels, which can go without water for several days, allows them to traverse vast, inhospitable landscapes. Their diet, rich in dates and milk, provides the necessary nutrients to endure the harsh desert climate."</p>
  	<p>"In stark contrast to their ability to endure heat, humans possess only minimal physiological adaptations to cold. These include the constriction of blood vessels in the extremities to preserve core body heat, and shivering to generate warmth through muscle activity. Prolonged exposure to cold, however, can lead to frostbite and hypothermia, conditions that are often fatal if untreated."</p>
  	<p>"Survival in cold environments is heavily reliant on cultural adaptations. Indigenous peoples of the Arctic, such as the Inuit, have developed sophisticated clothing systems utilizing animal furs and skins, which provide excellent insulation. Additionally, their traditional diets are high in fat, which is metabolized to produce heat in the body. Shelter is also critical: the construction of igloos, which trap body heat, and the use of communal sleeping arrangements help conserve warmth during the long polar nights.</p>
  	<p>The Inuit people’s lifestyle is a masterclass in cold weather survival. Their knowledge of the environment allows them to hunt and fish in conditions that would incapacitate less adapted humans. The consumption of raw, fatty foods like seal blubber not only provides necessary calories but also supplies vital nutrients that are scarce in the Arctic, such as Vitamin C."</p>
  	<p>"High altitudes pose a significant challenge due to the reduced oxygen levels in the atmosphere. Humans respond to this by increasing their breathing rate and heart rate, which temporarily boosts oxygen intake. Over time, the body produces more red blood cells, improving oxygen transport. However, these adaptations are not without risk. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE), and High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) are serious, often fatal, conditions that can occur if the body fails to adapt adequately.</p>
  	<p>The Sherpas, renowned for their mountaineering skills, have adapted to the extreme altitudes of the Himalayas, where oxygen levels are as low as 50% of those at sea level. They exhibit a unique genetic adaptation—a variant of the EPAS1 gene—that allows for more efficient use of oxygen. This, combined with their deep cultural knowledge of the mountains, allows them to survive at the highest elevation on their planet without much difficulty."</p>
  	<p>"Humans have limited natural resistance to radiation. However, their ability to understand and manipulate their environment has allowed them to mitigate the effects of radiation exposure. This is particularly evident in their use of protective clothing, lead shielding, and the development of technologies that monitor radiation levels.</p>
  	<p>The human ability to maximize their technological advantage and use collective lateral thinking in their problem solving has allowed them to have an excellent survival rate even in the most irradiated conditions available to them. On Earth the undisputed most irradiated zone is the ruins of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near the city of Pripyat, Ukraine. The reactor, a primitive fission system, underwent a full meltdown due to corruption reducing its safety mechanisms and improper construction. At the height of the disaster, the radiation levels were estimated to be <span class="toggle-item">three hundred</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">300</span> Sieverts per hour, not quite instantly fatal to a human, but enough to kill them within the month. Currently the radiation has subsided to 2.5 microsieverts per hour.</p>
  	<p>Context thus established, the Chernobyl disaster response saw the deployment of over 600,000 workers, known as "liquidators," who undertook the dangerous task of cleaning up radioactive material. The overwhelming majority survived due to the use of protective gear and the careful management of exposure times. Only <span class="toggle-item">ten percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">10%</span> of liquidators died from radiation related conditions."</p>
  	<p>"Humans are remarkably adept at surviving in all manner of conditions. They have a term for planets like Earth within their fiction. Death Worlds. Planets which are inhabitable, but only just, and teaming with preditors of all kinds. They see themselves as the undisputed kings of a Death World, a view that I am inclined to agree with. Biologically humans have many shortcomings in terms of environmental adaptation, but they are driven to live wherever they can carve out a niche for themselves. With the right technology and a few clever ideas there is nowhere humans are not capable of surviving and few places they could not thrive.</p>
  	<p>Once humans take to the stars they will seek to settle far off exotic worlds. Wanderlust is in their blood. Fortunately for the galaxy, the humans who seek to live in remote places, frontiers, and/or rural places tend to prefer the types of environments we ourselves consider undesirable."</p>

    	<h4>Life Cycle</h4>
    	<p>Most human reproduction takes place by internal fertilization via sexual intercourse, but they have developed crude technological means of assisted reproduction and are working on artificial reproduction. Notably, despite their bioengineering technology's shortcomings are nearly finished with a process they call "in-vitro gametogenesis" which would allow them to create gametes from any cell, thereby allowing even same sex couples to bear genetically related offspring.</p>
  	<p>The average gestation period for a human is 38 weeks, but a normal pregnancy can vary by up to 37 days. Embryonic development in the human covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus. Humans are able to induce early labor or perform a cesarean section if the child needs to be born earlier for medical reasons.[193] In developed countries, infants are typically <span class="toggle-item">three to four kilograms (seven to nine pounds)</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">3–4 kg (7–9 lb)</span> in weight and <span class="toggle-item">forty seven to fifty three centimeters (nineteen to twenty one inches)</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">47–53 cm (19–21 in)</span> in height at birth. However, low birth weight is common in poorer human nationstates, as well as a key factor in the high levels of infant mortality in these regions.</p>
  	<p>Human childbirth is dangerous, with a much higher risk of complications and death compared to most species. This is due to several biological issues arising from their evolutionary history which could be trivially cured with medical technology readily available within our sector. Given human labor can last for a full day and is so painful their females are often given dangerously addictive drugs to block out the pain, using our ability to cure this ill as a bargaining chip would be exceptionally cruel.</p>
  	<p>Human children are helpless at birth (a rare trait in sapient species) and require constant and immediate care to survive. In a typical human family both the mother and the father provide care for their offspring, in contrast to other primates, where parental care is mostly done by the mother. Humans requite approximately <span class="toggle-item">fifteen to seventeen</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">15-17</span> years to reach sexual maturity, but are not considered adults culturally until they reach <span class="toggle-item">eighteen</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">18</span> years. Interestingly the human brian continues its growth and development stage until approximately <span class="toggle-item">twenty five</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">25</span> years of age (The average sapient species reaches sexual and mental maturity simultaneously.). Humans are aware of this fact, yet refuse to change their cultural and legal definitions of adulthood to match their biological age of adulthood.</p>
  	<div class="indent">
    	<h5>Legal Notice for Human Relations</h5>
    	<p>Due to human maturation not having syncratious sexual and mental developmental speeds, Sector Law would in ordinary circumstances concider any romantic relationship with a human below the age of <span class="toggle-item">twenty five</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">25</span> years to be statuatory rape of a child.</p>
    	<p>Howeaver, after through examination of human culture, biology, and history the H-<span class="toggle-item">ninty nine</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">99</span> Sector High Court has ruled that humans are mature enough for romantic relationships by age <span class="toggle-item">twenty one</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">21</span> (due to their sexual maturity arriving much sooner than their mental maturity). Individuals intrested in dating a human can therefore persue humans as young as <span class="toggle-item">twenty one</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">21</span>, though they are likly to find humans of that age to be a little immature, nieve, and idealistic for their liking. If you like the Gid, you'll probably like a human between the ages of <span class="toggle-item">twenty one and twenty five</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">21 and 25</span>.</p>
  	</div>
  	<p>The human life span has been split into various stages ranging from three to twelve. These devisions are largely cultural with scientific, psychological, and biological facts being largely ignored. Common stages include infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age. The lengths of these stages have varied across cultures and time periods but is typified by an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence. Human females undergo an additional life stage called "menopause" which marks the end of their reproductive capabilities and causes some cognitive behavioral changes. This occurs around <span class="toggle-item">fifty</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">50</span> years. Many human females adopt child caring roles after menopause, especially for their grandchildren.</p>
  	<p>The human life span is somewhat short by galatic standards at <span class="toggle-item">seventy four point nine</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">74.9</span> years for females and <span class="toggle-item">seventy point four</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">70.4</span> for males. With access to better healthcare and nutrishion, many humans can reach <span class="toggle-item">eighty</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">80</span> years of age. Their current maximum lifespan is <span class="toggle-item">one hundred and twenty two</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">122</span> years, with some evidence to sugest 150 is possible. Howeaver these extended piriods do not come with additional youth, leading most humans to avoid lifestyles which would allow them to reach such advanced years.</p>
  	<div class="indent">
    	<h5>Age Based Degenerative Diseases</h5>
    	<p>Humans suffer from several conditions which cause extreme mental decay in their later years. Dementia is the most common of these conditions. It involves the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a human's daily life and activities. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of daily living, such as feeding oneself.</p>
    	<p>One of the most feared causes of dementia is called Alzheimer’s Disease. Alzheimer's disease accounts for <span class="toggle-item">sixty to eighty percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">60-80%</span> of dementia cases. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years. In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer's, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. On average, a person with Alzheimer's lives four to eight years after diagnosis but can live as long as <span class="toggle-item">twenty</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">20</span> years, depending on other factors.</p>
    	<p>By galactic definitions and laws, the decay caused by these conditions is typically so severe that the individual cannot be classified as sapient in the later stages. There is no cure and treatments can only lengthen the time it takes for the decay to set in. Humans are extremely likely to spend significant time and effort attempting to cure this condition once given access to more advanced scientific knowledge.</p>
  	</div>
  	<p>Available medical and genetic technology could increase the human lifespan to approximately <span class="toggle-item">two hundred and forty four</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">244</span> years, and delay the onset of middle and old age until the final four decades. Programs are already underway to be able to deliver life extension treatments to human generations starting with those born after <span class="toggle-item">nineteen eighty</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">1980</span>. These are intended to be given in exchange for assistance with several key problems effecting the sector.</p>

    	<h4>History</h4>
    	<p>Humans have yet to make any real impact on the galactic or even sector stage. Their history is typical for most species: lots of bloody violence and competition over resources, power, influence, and so on. The most standout elements being their crazy-fast development after discovering the scientific method and their space program.</p>
  	<p>In relation to us, humans unofficial first contact occurred on <span class="toggle-item">February twenty fifth in the year nineteen forty two</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">2/5/1942</span> when a pirate vessel attempted to extort platinum from the humans' dominant military power the United States of America (aka USA / US, not to be confused with the Universal Sentience Assessment). The pirate vessel was defeated by the US Air Force as their aircraft's kinetic weapons while primitive were able to overwhelm the pirate vessle's outdated and poorly maintained shields. Following this incident the Jirrins made contact with Earth's governments to apologize for their failure to keep their "neighbors" safe. After a short period of unease and mistrust, humans came to realize the Jirrins were genuine in their claims of kinship and have worked with them over the years in many small ways.</p>
  	<p>Earth's future potential is considered valuable enough to the Jirrin Empire for it to be willing to pay the yearly fine to SEIO for having contact with a primitive species. The empire has been working to accelerate humanity's social development with a goal of official first contact taking place in <span class="toggle-item">twenty forty eight</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">2048</span>.</p>
  	<p>In the mean time, the <a href="HithikersProgram.html">Hitchhiker Program</a> has allowed select humans access to our sector as a whole. Approximately <span class="toggle-item">twenty three thousand</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">23,000</span> humans currently reside off Earth, either with host families or independently. The vast majority of these individuals have proven to be delightful company, incredibly helpful, and well worth putting up with their species idiosyncrasies, oddities, and perplexing behaviors.</p>

  	<h4>Insane Shit Humans Have Done</h4>
  	<p>Apologies for the expletive in this section title, but it is necessary. Below is a list of some of the most batshit insane things we've been able to verify humans have done.</p>
  	<ul>
    	<li>A human once <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Lotito">ate an aircraft</a>.</li>
    	<li>Waged and lost a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War">war against a species of large bird</a>.</li>

    	<li>Attempted to use nocturnal flying mammals as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_bomb">delivery mechanism for incendiary devices</a>.</li>
    	<ul>
      	<li>Likely inspired by the time 1000 years prior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_of_Kiev">a human</a> managed to pull it off, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korosten">but with avians</a>.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<li>Turn tens of thousands if not millions of graves into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris">elaborate subterranean maze beneath a major world city</a>, where the bones are artfully stacked, yet the area is not illuminated nor typically open for viewings.</li>
    	<li>Held <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_trial">trials for animals to prosecute them for crimes</a>. This lasted for centuries.</li>

    	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Baumgartner">Jumped from the edge of space for fun</a>. Survived. </li>
    	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Ralston">A human once amputated their own arm</a> in the middle of a rocky desert to escape being pinned between rocks. They survived, making it back to civilization on foot without aid. They then replaced their limb with a mechanical prosthetic and continued to adventure on their own. Unaided by others. Usually days of travel from civilization.</li>
    	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Watson">An adolescent female human once circumnavigated their ocean on her own</a>. In a <i>sailboat</i>.</li>
    	<li>A human once took a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_the_Amazon">casual stroll through a continent spanning jungle</a> simply to walk the length of their planet's longest river.</li>
    	<ul>
      	<li>The Amazon Jungle is one of the deadliest places on Earth, and is so difficult to navigate, explore, and survive in, that there are small tribes of neolithic humans living within it who have never been in contact with the rest of humanity. And this man just, walked through it. Undaunted.</li>

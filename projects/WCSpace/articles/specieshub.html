        <p>This page serves as a list summersing and classifying your neighbors by species.</p>

        <h4>Major Species</h4>
        <p>Major Species are those with multi-planet civilzations, extreemly well developed single-system space faring nations, and those with an extreemly high level of economic importance.</p>

        <ul>
          <li> <h5><a href="jirrins.html">Jirrins</a></h5><p>Aborial near-humans, very simmilar looking to humans, albiet with some squirrel-like features. Able to see energy currents, climb most surfices, and are extreemly collectivist. Have the largest empire in the sector.</p> </li>
          <li> <h5><a href="grays.html">Grays</a></h5><p>A dimunitive humanoid species known to human folkore as both the "Roswell Grays" and "Little Green Men" due to their complex lifecycle. Notable for having no central government and working as groups of clans through a mixture of formal and informal alliances.</p> </li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Minor Species</h4>
        <p>Minor species have a homeworld within Quiet Space, but do not leave a large impact on the sector as a whole. Most of them are still developing into a starfaring people, but some are simply isolationists or content with remaining a planetary scociety.</p>

        <ul>
          <li> <h5><a href="axxani.html">Axxani</a></h5><p>A primarily tauric polymorphic authropoid hivemind. Astonishingly, she is quite friendly and acts like a single bodied individual. Currently in the process of develoiping her home system. Primarily intrested in scocilizing with others (Suffers from extreem autophobia from her pre-contact isolation. Genuinly loves the fact that other thinking minds exist to be a danger).</p> </li>
          <li> <h5><a href="Unicae.html">Unicae</a></h5><p>A species of marine mammels. Notable for being a clone race and their AI run post-labor scociety. Generaly remain on their homeworld, seemingly out of shyness.</p> </li>
          <li> <h5><a href="humans.html">Humans</a></h5><p>A bipedal species evolved from savanah dwelling primates. Native to Earth. This wiki is intended to be red by humans, this entry exists to provide context to non-human readers.</p> </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Colonist Species</h4>
        <p>Colonist species are species that can be found on settlments within Quiet Space but do not have a homeworld within it.</p>

        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h4>Traveler Species</h4>
        <p>Traveler species are those who either exist only in small groups (more than individual travelers or tourists) such as nomadic species, or species who are entirly space based. In either case they do not have a homeworld within the sector, but none the less can be found in large groups within it. Any settlments they make / own / operate must be mobile for this classification to apply.</p>

        <ul>
          <li> <h5><a href="Gid.html">Gid</a></h5><p>A near-human species with monkey-like feeatures. Notable for having had a simmilar evolutionay history to humans, albiet having evolved from monkies rather than apes. Notably energetic, cheerful, and mischevious. Their entire species exists as spacefaring nomads, having lost their homeworld long ago.</p> </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Greetings, fellow interstellar enthusiasts and aspiring ambassadors of unity! (I'm sorry they made me call you that. I wanted to go with Space Tourists but <i>apparently</i> that's not exciting enough.) We, the <a href="axxani.html">Axxani</a> Volunteer Coordination Team (All one of me!), are excited to share with you the details of our beloved initiative, the Galactic Hitchhiker's Program. This program is designed to foster friendships, cultural exchange, and mutual understanding between humans and your neighbors within Quiet Space.</p>
        <p>What's Quiet Space? That's where we live. The Wak'Cha Sector. Translates to "Quiet Space" sector. It didn't used to be called that, but hey. Times change. On the up side you're in a very peaceful part of the galixy.</p>
        <h4>Program Overview</h4>
        <p>The Galactic Hitchhiker's Program is a volunteer-based effort run by a small but dedicated group of me, Axxani (I'm a hive mind. Don't worry, I'm not an all consuming swarm. Unless you're made of honey or something tasty like aphids.). Our program revolves around randomly selected locations on Earth where we discreetly establish designated pickup points. These points are chosen for their relative obscurity and low likelihood of immediate detection, ensuring that only those truly eager for a cosmic adventure are likely to find them.</p>
        <p>Individual humans who arrive at a designated point at a pickup time will be shuttled off world and assigned a host family or individual who will be your guide to the galixy. A smaller number of points are reserved for humans looking for romance with an alien partner. Plenty of us are also into xenos, so a small matchmaking service has been established for this purpose.</p>
        <h4>How It Works</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Volunteer Recruitment</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>We recruit volunteers from various species across the galaxy (Mostly within Quiet Space) who are keen on meeting humans. These volunteers range from curious scholars and cultural enthusiasts to those seeking companionship or even potential romantic partners. (Also me. We just want somone to play videogames with and cuddle. Do you have any idea how boring it is to play a MMO by yourself, against yourself, that was designed by yourself?)</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Pickup Points</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>We establish hidden pickup points at random spots around the world. These locations are carefully selected to avoid detection by Earth’s governments and to ensure the safety of both our volunteers and the participating humans.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Arrival</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>On a predetermined schedule (Current locations and times can be found on this page.), our volunteers arrive at these pickup points, ready to welcome any human who has discovered the location and wishes to embark on an interstellar journey. (Including MIB agents, provided you've quit working for those assholes.) Fair warning, if you panic on seeing one of us we might leave you behind. The pickup windows are very tight and we may not have time to calm you down, so prepare yourself to see non-human persons before you arrive. Also we do most of the pickups, so if you're scared of insects or aurthropods this program may not be for you.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Embarking</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Humans who arrive at these points and choose to join the program are swiftly transported to our vessels, where they begin their journey across the stars. Due to the secrecy imposed by Earth’s governments, these humans must remain off-planet until the day when the existence of extraterrestrial life is publicly acknowledged. This is for your protection as various agencies across the world will detain you uppon your return if they discover you've been offworld.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Integration and Exchange</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Once aboard, humans are introduced to their alien hosts, who guide them through various cultural exchanges, educational programs, and adventures across different worlds. Special care is taken to ensure their well-being and to facilitate meaningful connections between species. (Unless you're me, apparently... I still don't have somone to try multiplayer minecraft with.)</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Special Designations</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Among our pickup points, a select few are specifically designated for humans interested in exploring romantic relationships with aliens. These locations are marked with unique symbols, and volunteers with similar interests are assigned to these points to increase the likelihood of forming deeper connections. If you go to one of these points by accident, that's on you. Don't blame the poor Jirrian girl for greeting you with a big hug and playfull grope (That behavior is normal for a first encounter with somoen you are intrested in in their culture.).</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <h4>Our Mission and Vision</h4>
        <p>The Galactic Hitchhiker's Program aims to build a foundation of trust and friendship between humans and extraterrestrial beings. By bringing adventurous humans into the fold, we hope to create ambassadors who will one day bridge the gap between Earth and the galaxy at large (and also have friends of your species, which is you know, kinda cool. Also you make the best entertainment in the sector.).</p>
        <p>Our ultimate vision is a future where interstellar travel and cooperation are not simply commonplace but just "the way it is". A future where the people of Earth can freely explore the wonders of the universe, and help us take this dump from a one to a ten, like it was in the good old days. Until that day arrives, we remain committed to ensuring that every human who joins our program has a transformative and enriching experience.</p>
        <h4>FAQ</h4>
        <p>Due to humans making the same requests repeatedly, we have added this FAQ:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>What is the riskof catching an alien diseease / illness?</i><br><b>A:</b> Basicaly zero. The human bioform profile has been registered with our medical database since 1978. We will be giving you vaccines against what few diseases we know can be transfered to you as soon as we reach orbit. If you do get sick, basic healthcare is provided at no charge by Galatic Law. You'll be fine.</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>Does this cost anything?</i><br><b>A:</b> No. The program is volunteer-driven and funded by various benevolent entities across the galaxy. All we ask is that participants come with an open mind and a spirit of adventure. Remeber, what we want is humans out and about before your governments are cool with that.</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>What should I bring with me if I find a pickup point?</i><br><b>A:</b> You should bring any personal items you feel are necessary for an extended stay away from Earth. Essential items might include clothing, personal hygiene products, and any cherished belongings. Rest assured, our volunteers will provide all the necessities you need for your journey. Howeaver, we cannot garentee the safty of the majority of your posisions. You should make arangments for long term sotrage of anything irreplaceable that cannot fit into 2 cubic meters of space. That's your cargo limit.</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>How long will I be away from Earth?</i><br><b>A:</b> Due to the secrecy surrounding the existence of extraterrestrial life, you will need to remain off-planet until Earth governments officially acknowledge aliens. This duration is currently undetermined, but rest assured that your safety and well-being are our top priorities. Many humans have been off world for 3 decades now, and don't mind it at all.</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>Will I be able to communicate with my family and friends on Earth?</i><br><b>A:</b> Unfortunately, to maintain secrecy and ensure the safety of all participants, communication with Earth must be limited. However, you will be able to keep a record of your experiences, which you can share once it is safe to return. (Or if you slip a <a href="grays.html">Gray</a> 20 credits and ask nicly they can totaly deliver physical mail.)</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>What kind of experiences can I expect?</i><br><b>A:</b> Your journey will be filled with a variety of cultural exchanges, educational programs, and adventures across different worlds. You will have the opportunity to learn about alien cultures, languages, and technologies, and form meaningful connections with countless individuals. (If you drop by my planet, I've got go carts and lasertag :D)</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>Are there any risks involved?</i><br><b>A:</b> As with any adventure, there are inherent risks. However, our volunteers are trained to ensure your safety and well-being throughout your journey. We take every precaution to minimize risks and provide a secure environment for all participants. (The biggest risk is getting caught by the MIB on departure. Honestly if you're not okay with possibly getting shot at, don't come by.)</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>Can I choose which alien species I want to meet?</i><br><b>A:</b> Yes. Once in orbit there will be a brief orientation followed by a survay. You can select a specie sof intrest on the survay. (Except me. Apparently I'm "too creepy" and might "scare them off".)</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>What happens if I change my mind after joining the program?</i><br><b>A:</b> Once you reach orbit, returning to Earth is impossible for political reasons. Strictly speaking, as soon as you see one of us, you are in danger for those same reasons. This is not a decision to be taken lightly. Howeaver, if you make it to space and can't "hack it" as you say, there is a space hab exclusivly populated by humans who could not overcome issues with encountering alien life. You will be given a home there and returned to Earth when possible.</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>How can I support the Galactic Hitchhiker's Program if I am not ready to leave Earth?</i><br><b>A:</b> If you want to support our work Earthside, we can always use volenteers to assist with hosting and migrating this site. Those of you with braver souls than most can join our crews in transporting individuals to pickup sites.</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>What is the best way to prepare for my journey?</i><br><b>A:</b> The best preparation is to come with an open mind and a willingness to embrace new experiences. Familiarize yourself with various speculative sci-fi literature and media to get an idea of what interstellar travel might be like. (I reccomend Galixy Quest and Trials in Tainted Space. It's pritty much like that.)</li>
          <li><b>Q:</b> <i>Do you provide towels?</i><br><b>A:</b> We have begun to provide those who do not show up with their own towel with a standard white terrycloth towel. If one of you could please explain to us why they are so important to your culture, and why you may not bring one on a trip with you if they are, please do.</li>

        <h3>Understanding the Universal Sentience Assessment: A Guide by the Galactic Institute of Comparative Biology</h3>

        <p>In our diverse and interconnected galaxy, it has become increasingly important to understand the capabilities of different species. The USA was developed to promote mutual understanding, enhance cooperative efforts, and provide a baseline for interspecies interactions.</p>
        <p>The Galactic Institute of Comparative Biology (GICB) is proud to introduce the Universal Sentience Assessment (USA), a groundbreaking evaluation tool designed to measure and compare the abilities of sentient species across the galaxy. This comprehensive test, developed in collaboration with leading scientists, xenobiologists, and sociocultural experts, provides a standardized method to assess various physical, cognitive, and social capabilities of different species.</p>
        <h4>What is the Universal Sentience Assessment?</h4>
        <p>The Universal Sentience Assessment is a multi-faceted test that evaluates a species' abilities across six core domains: Physical Abilities, Cognitive Abilities, Social and Emotional Abilities, Perceptual Abilities, Adaptive Abilities, and Metaphysical Abilities. Each domain encompasses specific sub-categories, allowing for a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of a species.</p>
        <p>It is important to note a proper assessment cannot be preformed with a sample size of less than 20 million indivuals, and the ideal sample size is 150 million. An assessment can be made using historical data provided the reccord is at least 84.89% accurate. Once an assessment has been made on a species, it can be fairly compared to other species. Furthermore, individuals can be comapred to their species baseline by taking the assessment, making the USA a common standard for determining disability. If you are reading this prior to a disability hearing requiring you to take the assessment, rest assured it was designed with this use in mind and will not be used as the sole determing factor.</p>
        <h4>How Does the USA Work?</h4>
        <p>The USA evaluates species on a scale from 1 to 20 in each sub-category, with 10 representing the average capability for sentient beings. Naturally the average changes over time as more species are measured by the USA. This is precicly the point and ensures that all species, regardless of their unique evolutionary paths, can be fairly and accurately compared. The test is conducted using a combination of observational studies, controlled experiments, and advanced neural imaging techniques.</p>

        <h4>Interpreting the Scores</h4>
        <p>Each score provides insight into the comparative abilities of a species. For example, a score of 15 in Endurance suggests that a species is highly capable of prolonged physical activity, while a score of 8 in Diplomacy might indicate challenges in peaceful conflict resolution. An overall score of 210 indicates a prefectly average species, the threashold for a sapient species is 170, and the threashold at which a species is concidered advanced is 270.</p>
        <p>These scores are not meant to rank species as "better" or "worse" but to highlight differences for use in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Policymaking, as workplace safty regulations, housing requirments, and community accomidations require such information. As do all other areas where concidering the needs of individuals at the species level is nessisary.</li>
          <li>Diplomatic Relations by means of fostering understanding of others strengths and limitations. Empathy for otehrs is the key to forming effective alliances.</li>
          <li>Medical Research. There are uncountable applications to properly contextualizing a species biological capabilities within the medical field.</li>
          <li>Education programs are most effective when tailored to the cognative average of those being educated.</li>
        </ul>

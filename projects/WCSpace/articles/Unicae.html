    	<h4>Appearance</h4>
    	<p>Unicae are a unique species of clones created by an artificial intelligence inorder to allow it to fulfill its programming. The AI was created by the clones' ancestors to manage their civilization's logistics (power generation, water purification, resource acquisition, materials refinement, etc.) but were driven to extinction by a superbug months after beginning the system online. When the AI realized its stockpiles were all full it came to the conclusion that its programming required people to consume the things it produced. Thus, it attempted to resurrect the species.</p>
  	<p>Unfortunately, only an individual specimine's DNA was able to be used for the cloning process the AI developed. As a result, the Unicae are genetically identical. This would ordinarily mean little other than ensuring all clones looked similar to one another. In this case, the Unicae's ancestors rely far more on genetics than epigenetics, with elements of personality being genetic. As a result, the clones are all identical and all have the same base personality, differing only by life experiences and some small differences with personal preferences.</p>
  	<p>In their natural unmodified state, all Unicae are short, slim, yet slightly curved, humanoids. They appear reptilian to an extent, but are actually marine mammals which returned to land in their evolutionary history. They have teal skin with darker striped markings on their tails (and occasionally their arms, legs, and/ or ribs), neon pink eyes with white pupils, black hair (which they all either highlight or dye to match their eyes), and long pointed ears. All Unicae are female.</p>
  	<p>Due to looking identical, Unicae have embraced body modification as a means of having some sort of unique feature. Tattoos, piercings, and other more extreme alterations are fairly common due to there only being so many tattoo and piercing designs the Unicae find appealing and the need for billions of individuals to feel unique. Identification of an individual Unicae is not difficult, provided one can read the radio frequency generated by the gem-inspired commlink implanted in their foreheads.</p>
  	<p>The Unicae are a <a href="psionics.html">psionic</a> species. While their ancestors were not generally psionic, Heria was one of their relatively few psykers albeit untrained. Her clones thus share her latent potential and are required by law to practice and master basic offensive and defensive psionic arts for planetary defense purposes.</p>

  	<button type="button" class="collapsible3">Unicae Eyes</button>
  	<div class="content">
    	<p>Unicae eyes are notable for their white pupils. In most species this would indicate a health condition such as cataracts, and would be vision impairing or blinding. The Unicae's eyes are as sharp as human eyes, with certain perks and advantages. The white coloring is a special lens which focuses/diffuses and polarizes light. It allows them to look at bright light without vision loss, and effectively amplify light to see in darker conditions. This adaptation is likely to have come from their time as aquatic mammals as they are capable of surviving up to 2km of water pressure. At such depths there is hardly any light to speak of.</p>
  	</div>
  	<br><br>
  	<button type="button" class="collapsible3">Commlinks and ID Codes</button>
  	<div class="content">
    	<p>Unicae have a small hot pink gemstone roughly the size of their eye implanted in their forehead. It appears to be a decorative gemstone outwardly, and 98.78% of Unicae find it aesthetically appealing. In addition to standard functions, the comlink broadcasts a unique ID code which is automatically picked up by other comlinks and translated into data for Unicae brains. This means all Unicae know not only if someone else is present within 50 meters, but who they are by name.</p>
    	<p>The comlink ID is similar to a MAC address as well as a name. This is because when a Unicae uses the internet, it's almost alway svia their comlink's neural interface. As such, Unicae have abandoned the concept of traditional names, using their IDs instead.</p>
    	<p>An example of a Unicae ID is: <i>9852036558365610</i>. Naturally this is too lengthy to use in verbal communication, and is shortened for casual daily use. An individual with this ID would likely go by Nine-Eight, Ninner-Eight, Six-Five, Twoh, Nieht, or some other short string or phoneticized string from their ID.</p>
    	<p>An exception to this convention is if the ID happens to be prime. If it is prime, this is seen as a sign of extremely good fortune and the Unicae will go by the name Motia <i>(Eng. Split)</i> which is used in their langauge's mathematical terms to mean "Prime".</p>

  	</div>

  	<h4>Heria Unicae</h4>
  	<p>The Unicae's Ancestor was a young female of her species (Name lost to time). Her citizen database ID reveals her name to have been Heria Unicae. The Unicae refer to her as "Big Sister" and object very strongly to being called Heria. Understanding Heria is key to understanding the Unicae as a whole.</p>
  	<p>Heria's records show her to have been relatively shy, something of a shut-in, and employed as a cryogenics worker. She specifically handled the monitoring and maintenance of cryogenic capsules for long term sample preservation at a major laboratory. Labor which was at the time too delicate for her species robots to handle (Though their AI was up to the task, the robots it could use to manipulate the environment lacked the dexterity, precision, and reflexes to handle this specific cryogenic fluid.). Extreme cold appears to also be a factor limiting the use of robots, as the chamber was cold enough to preserve Heria's corpse for cloning.</p>
  	<p>The records show Heria's only criminal activity were several instances of speeding and unpaid parking, with a note on her file indicating she once turned a bank's pen into a police station begging not to be arrested for theft. Her medical and psychological records show her to have been semi-disabled by her species standards, suffering from social anxieties and several phobias.</p>
  	<p>Her hobbies included reading, holographic dramas, and an apparent interest in martial arts as she had signed up for a traditional martial arts camp several weeks before her death. She had few friends, and while her emergency contact information lists a girlfriend rather than any immediate family, her comm records show she had not spoken to her girlfriend in several years before her death.</p>
  	<p>These factors show us an image reflected in the base Unicae. Due to the species' genetics carrying elements which form their personalities, all Unicae can be described as shy awkward "nerdy" women. Approximately 8.89% are "Deviations", individuals whose cloning process was for whatever reason, imperfect. These individuals form the only source of differing behavioral traits within the entire species and are treasured. The majority of them voluntarily live within medical centers and participate in ongoing efforts to diversity the clonebank's genetic library. </p>
  	<p>Every clone has the capacity to grow and differ from the baseline over time, though few stray far from the base. There are also some individuals who start out with minor personality differences who are not considered deviations for various medical, technical, and cultural reasons.</p>

  	<h4>AI Family</h4>
  	<p>Most of the Unicae are perfectly content serving the role for which they were created: Consuming the goods the Main Operations Machine produces. Those with more ambition or a dislike of their intended lifecycle are free to do as they please, provided it does not disrupt the system the majority depend on. The majority of these dissonants simply peacefully leave their homeworld to live in the wider galaxy, with only 0.003% attempting to change the system, and only 2.98% of those attempting to do so with violence.</p>
  	<p>This overwhelming acceptance of AI rule is due to the Unicae seeing the three AI systems they depend on as family members. If the AIs were typical, I.E. in all ways aside from those pertaining to the drive to perform their designated functions a person, this wouldn't be unusual. However, the AI systems employed by the Unicae are bailey more than expert systems capable of learning and adapting to new situations. If they are sapient it is not possible for an organic to detect this through interacting with them. All three come across as "a thinking machine" to those who interact with them.</p>
  	<p>The Unicae claim their commlinks and specific brain structures natural to their species allow them to interact with the AI systems in the same personified way as Galactic Standard AIR interfaces. However this has not been confirmed due to the Main Operations Machine declining to install a commlink in a non-Unicae for test purposes, citing an extreme risk of brain damage and a general disinterest in developing a procedure to preform the operation safely as this falls outside of its programming. Given the comlink is installed by growing a Unicae's brain around it, this is absolutely true and would indeed be a major undertaking.</p>
  	<p>The AI systems are as follow:</p>
  	<div class="indent">
    	<button type="button" class="collapsible3">Main Operations Machine</button>
      	<div class="content">
         	<p>The Main Operations Machine, or M.O.M., is the original logistics AI created by the Unicae's ancestors to handle all planetary logistics and essential tasks. It is capable of performing all necessary steps to provide the inhabitants of the planet with food, water, power, raw and refined resources, manufactured goods, communications, and even public transportation. In essence, if it is a service required for a civilization to run smoothly, M.O.M. "takes care" of it.</p>
      	<p>M.O.M. is notable for serving as the primary diplomat and point of contact for other civilizations. It acknowledges this is outside of its "primary programming" but points to its realization that the continued existence and prosperity of the Unicae (or at least, sapient organic life inhabiting its planet) is a fundamental requirement for its programming to be necessary to begin with. Thus, caring for its "Citizens" is a secondary function designed to ensure its primary function remains necessary. Thus, it is happy to ensure "international affairs" do not harm its citizens.</p>
      	<p>M.O.M. is adored by the Unicae, nearly all of whom see the AI as their genuine mother. This is likely due to the childrearing subroutines and systems M.O.M. created for assisting newly grown clones development imprinting themselves on each clone as a parental figure. The Unicae can be seen regularly talking to M.O.M. as any child would to a parent, and honor the AI on holidays in place of a parent. This also extends to the Direct Administration Device.</p>
      	</div>
    	<br><br>
    	<button type="button" class="collapsible3">Direct Administration Device</button>
      	<div class="content">
         	<p>The Direct Administration Device, or D.A.D., is an administrative AI designed by the Unicae to handle top level administration of their civilization. It serves the same function as a head of state, albeit it answers to M.O.M. and all administrative tasks and operations it performs exist to ensure the continued operation of the system, improve the system for its user base (IE the Unicae), or address problems as they arise to restore the status quo. Notably it does not handle diplomacy with other civilizations unless instructed to do so by the Main Operations Machine.</p>
      	<p>The system is excellent at these tasks, and widely regarded as one of the more effective administrators in the Galaxy. At least, when compared to organics. It isn't much better than the top 5% of organics, but has the capacity to in effect, be everywhere at once. The D.A.D. is however a work in progress and constantly being upgraded, expanded, and given additional capabilities as the technically inclined Unicae seek to bring it in line with the Main Operations Machine in terms of being nearly perfect for its intended function.</p>
      	<p>The Unicae have recently begun a cultural practice of gifting the Direct Administration Device 750ml containers of fresh coolant, individual power cells, and decorative cable ties with various patterns. This is an annual ritual, taking place on the 9th day of the 3rd month of the Unicae calendar. It began after the Unicae made a cultural study of Earth's various cultures, though its source within human culture is unknown.</p>

    	<button type="button" class="collapsible3">Battle / Intelligence Guardian Bot for Regional Operational Threat Handling and Engagement Resolution</button>
      	<div class="content">
       	<p>The Battle / Intelligence Guardian Bot for Regional Operational Threat Handling and Engagement Resolution, or B.I.G. B.R.O.T.H.E.R., is an AI system designed to defend the Unicae's homeworld on the land, sea, air, and in space. It is a remarkably efficient and ruthless defense system, capable of handling every step in defensive operations. While it is not capable of offensive missions, it is able to counterattack within the bounds of systems placed within its care.</p>
    	<p>Its combat record is a flawless, assuming one counts overall victories and ignores the loss of military assets. It has been activated 115 times since its creation, primarily to counter pirates, but also in 8 traditional military engagements. During these operations its average asset loss rate was 7.38%.</p>
    	<p>The Unicae refuse to share B.I.G. B.R.O.T.H.E.R.'s design principals, let alone code, with the galaxy at large. They cite not only security reasons, but imply the key to its effectivity is cultural and social. The system is active during peace time, and interacts with Citizens on a regular basis in the form of participating in videogame matches. This appears to help the system improve its tactical and strategic reasoning, though the Unicae insist these interactions simply are "to hang out", implying the AI is complex and developed enough to fight harder to protect those it cares for.</p>
    	<p>While possible, and indeed a feature of several defense AI systems in the galaxy, the complexity of this particular system does not appear to have the necessary components for such things. In any case, the systems' reputation as exceptionally adept in the art of war has led to a long era of peace for the Unicae.</p>
    	<p>A final interesting note on the system is its serial number <i>(0N-11-5AN)</i> is apparently amusing to humans. If this is simply a "funny number" like 69 or 420, please inform site Administration. Otherwise we would appreciate an answer to this small mystery.</p>
      	</div>
  	</div>

  	<h4>Synthetic Organics</h4>
    	<p>Unicae are products of intentional design. While most of their bodies are unaltered from the baseline DNA profile, several aspects have been tweaked, replaced, or updated over time by M.O.M. either to overcome hazards which natural reproduction should have addressed, or to solve problems affecting large numbers of clones. An example of these changes being an engineered immunity to the superbug which drove their ancestors to extinction.</p>
  	<p>The Unicae's cloning method does not result in long-term stability. Unaided by medical science or special diets, a Unicae can be expected to live for 2-3 years before succumbing to organ failure due to cellular decay. A genetic fix for this condition is a top priority, but proves exceptionally difficult to discover and may not exist. Fortunately a full lifespan of 220 years can be achieved through regular baths in the fluid used to grow each Unicae, or through a diet including large amounts of <i>Spinacia oleracea</i>.</p>
  	<div class="indent">
    	<h5>Spinach</h5>
    	<p>Spinach <i>(Spinacia oleracea)</i> is a leafy green flowering plant native to Earth. It is rich in folacin, phylloquinone, and manganese and has a cellular structure similar to a now extinct variety of seaweed native to Kellis. The seaweed, and now spinach, served the Unicae's ancestors as a regenerative drug that promoted the production of stemcells. Unlike the ancient seaweed, tangible benefits can be had simply by eating the spinach as the key resources exist in higher concentrations and thus can be assimilated by the Unicae’s digestive system. A simple update to their genetic structure by M.O.M. allows them to synthesize the drug inturnaly when its components are available.</p>
    	<p>While the cloning fluid and Spinach can both sustain a Unicae's body for their natural lifespan, the use of both together appears to halt the aging process, and slowly rejuvenate the clone (or accelerate their aging) until they return to / reach their physical prime. Consequently, the Unicae are keen to import other plants in the <i>chenopodioideae</i> family for their medical research.</p>
  	</div>
  	<p>As one might expect of a computer system, one of the changes made to the Unicae allows them to be "updated" when M.O.M. has a new feature for them. These updates are normally achieved in a few hours of rest within a cloning pod. As the pods are needed both for ongoing health issues and regular genetic updates each Unicae has their own personal pod which serves the same purpose as a bed.</p>

  	<h4>Psionic Abilities</h4>
  	<p>Due to being cloned from a psyker, all Unicae are psionic. Their latent potential is quite high, again, due to the individual from which they descend. Like all psykers they have the potential to learn any of the various psionic abilities, but have a particular knack for physical augmentation <i>(The ability to enhance one's own body beyond its natural limits.)</i> .</p>
  	<p>This talent makes developing and working with this particular ability natural enough for the Unicae that it's functionally indistinguishable from working out. A Unicae will always be able to run further / faster, lift more, and endure more than their biology alone implies. The amount their psionic power can enhance them increases geometrically with training time, resulting in the most adept and well trained Unicae being capable of absurd physical feets on par with many super hero comics.</p>

    	<h4>Environs Typically Inhabited</h4>
    	<p>The Unicae are native to the planet Kellis, a water world orbiting the star Quel <i>(known to earth as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOI-700">TOI-700</a>)</i>. Despite their planet's surface being 98.74% water the Unicae are land-dwelling mammals. DNA evidence indicates they were once marine mammals. The reason for their return to land is unknown.</p>
  	<p>Unicae prefer to live near water, but seemingly dislike being in large open bodies of water despite wanting them nearby. To this end they are known to construct large artificial islands and floating habitats. Most of their cities have a core anchored around an island with the districts of the city floating on massive pontoons linked in a web-like configuration.</p>
  	<p>Due to the Unicae's psionic powers they are able to survive in extreme conditions. They can live comfortably within a temperature range of -40-55 C <i>(-40-131 F)</i> indefinitely, and endure more extreme conditions for short periods (minutes to hours), including the vacuum of space which they can endure for approximately 15 minutes on average.</p>

    	<h4>Life Cycle</h4>
    	<p>Unicae are clones. They are industrial produced in one of many cloning facilities on Kellis. They are kept unconscious while being grown and despite having their comlinks implanted when they are a mere bundle of cells do not receive any external information despite being grown. Unicae are grown to adulthood (21 years) as a matter of policy, but can be safely removed from their tank as young as 3 years old.</p>
  	<p>Despite being physical adults, Unicae need to undergo a short period of learning and development due to not being taught anything while growing. This process is called "habilitation" by the Unicae and is handled by the Main Operations Machine. It involves some childrearing techniques carried out through robotic drones (with some assistance from mature clones) but also relies on the embedded comlink to "drip feed" key information such as the ability to speak and the definitions of basic words.</p>
  	<p>The reason for not using the comlink in this way while the clone is grown is to facilitate deviation from the clone base. Writing information to the brain while it is developing would "prune" behavioral traits, which the Unicae attempt to cultivate.</p>
  	<p>Unicae aging is identical to human aging, albeit it takes nearly twice as long for them to reach a given point as their maximum lifespan is 220 years. Unicae's nature as clones may provide them with routes to biological immortality, though it's unlikely many of them would desire immortality as they tend to get bored of life after 170-180 years. This appears to be a biological process rather than a mental one.</p>

    	<h4>History</h4>
    	<p>The Unicae are not major players within <a href="QuietSpace.html">Quiet Space</a>. They have lived on their world in their current system for the last 500 years. During this time they have primarily remained on their homeworld, barely making use of their home system's resources. This places them just barely beyond the threshold for First Contact, a state they seem content to remain in.</p>
  	<p>They are most notable for leaving parts of their system to the <a href="JirrinEmpire.html"> Jirrin Empire</a> for mining, scientific, and military purposes. The military outpost the Jirrin were allowed to construct is limited to serving as a resupply station for their Rangers, though has on occasion assisted B.I.G. B.R.O.T.H.E.R. with defending the system.</p>
  	<p>The Unicae have a special love for human art and culture. It is theorized that a large human presence within the greater galaxy will likely be the catalyst for them to leave their homeworld as well.</p>

        <h3>Galactic Taxonomical Classification System (GTCS)</h3>

        <p>The Galactic Taxonomical Classification System (GTCS) is a standardized framework designed to categorize and group sapient, tool-using species across the galaxy based on shared physical and functional traits. While acknowledging the vast diversity of life, the GTCS assumes that certain convergent evolutionary pressures—such as the need for tool use, mobility, and sensory perception—result in similar morphological outcomes. This system provides a basis for understanding and cataloging species in a manner that facilitates communication, research, and interspecies relations.</p>

        <h4>Classification Structure</h4>
        <p>The GTCS uses a hierarchical structure similar to terrestrial biological classification but adapted for the unique challenges of a galactic scale. The primary categories are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sapientia</li>
          <li>Morphotype</li>
          <li>Environmental Adaptation</li>
          <li>Locomotion</li>
          <li>Manipulation</li>
          <li>Sensory Specialization</li>
          <li>Species</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Sapientia</h4>
        <p>Sapientia is a Kingdom of life which exists at the Galatic scale. The Kingdom Sapientia encompasses all known sapient, tool-using species. This kingdom is distinguished by high cognitive abilities, complex social structures, and the capacity for advanced tool use and technological development. It does not favtor in morphology, genetic relation, or any factors other than the ability to apply knowledge or experience or understanding or common sense and insight, and the use of tools.</p>
        <h4>Morphotype</h4>
        <p>The Morphotype phylum is based on the primary body plan and physical structure, which directly influences how a species interacts with its environment. The catagories of Morphtype are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Bipedia:</b> Species with two limbs used primarily for locomotion, often with two additional limbs adapted for manipulation or other functions.</li>
          <li><b>Quadrupedia:</b> Species with four limbs used for both locomotion and manipulation. This group includes species that walk on all fours and use specialized limbs or appendages for tool use.</li>
          <li><b>Multipedia:</b> Species with more than four limbs, where different limbs may serve different functions, including locomotion, manipulation, or sensory input.</li>
          <li><b>Radialia:</b> Species with radial symmetry, where multiple limbs or appendages extend from a central point. Often includes species adapted for environments like zero-gravity.</li>
          <li><b>Serpentia:</b> Elongated, limbless species that have developed unique methods of manipulation and tool use through other appendages or body segments.</li>
          <li><b>Amorphia:</b>  Species with highly flexible, non-rigid bodies that may change shape or reconfigure their bodies for different tasks, often using multiple pseudopods or tendrils.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Environmental Adaptation</h4>
        <p>This classification is based on the primary environment in which the species evolved and are most adapted to thrive.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Terrans:</b> Species adapted to terrestrial environments, including planets with solid surfaces, varied climates, and diverse ecosystems.</li>
          <li><b>Aquatica:</b> Species adapted to aquatic environments, either fully submerged or amphibious, capable of tool use underwater.</li>
          <li><b>Aeriacs:</b> Species adapted to aerial environments, including those with extensive flight capabilities or living in low-gravity, atmospheric conditions.</li>
          <li><b>Xerophians:</b> Species adapted to arid or desert environments with extreme temperatures and limited water resources.</li>
          <li><b>Cryophians:</b> Species adapted to cold environments, including ice-covered planets or regions with permanent snow and ice.</li>
          <li><b>Astra:</b> Species adapted to space or zero-gravity environments, often exhibiting traits that allow for survival without a planetary surface.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Locomotion</h4>
        <p>The Locomotion category distinguishes species by their primary mode of movement. This has nothing to do with their overall shape. It is soly focused on how they locomote. IE; A species with 6 legs where 4 are only for balance or remainig upright but 2 are for locomotion is a member of Bipedae, but not Bipedia. Furthermore, only the primary method of locomotion is used for classification.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Bipedae:</b> Bipedal locomotion using two limbs.</li>
          <li><b>Quadrupedae:</b> Quadrupedal locomotion using four limbs.</li>
          <li><b>Hexapedae:</b> Locomotion using six limbs.</li>
          <li><b>Glideae:</b> Species that glide or fly.</li>
          <li><b>Serpentae:</b> Slithering or undulating movement.</li>
          <li><b>Amorphae:</b> Movement through flow or oozing.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Manipulation</h4>
        <p>This category groups species by how they manipulate tools and objects within their environment.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Dextera:</b> Species with hands, claws, or similarly structured appendages for fine manipulation.</li>
          <li><b>Tentacula:</b> Species that use tentacles or similar flexible appendages for manipulation, often with numerous sensory inputs.</li>
          <li><b>Mandibula:</b> Species that use mandibles, beaks, or similar mouthparts for manipulation.</li>
          <li><b>Externa:</b> Species that use external tools or exoskeletal modifications to manipulate objects, possibly due to the lack of natural manipulators.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Sensory Specialization</h4>
        <p>This classification is determined by the primary sensory apparatus that species rely on.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Oculata:</b> Species with highly developed vision as their primary sense.</li>
          <li><b>Audita:</b> Species that rely primarily on hearing, often with advanced echolocation or sound-based communication.</li>
          <li><b>Olfacta:</b> Species with a heightened sense of smell, often critical for navigation and interaction.</li>
          <li><b>Tactila:</b> Species with highly sensitive touch receptors, possibly using their skin or external appendages to sense their environment.</li>
          <li><b>Psionica:</b> Species with psionic or telepathic abilities that form the basis of their sensory experience and communication.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Species</h4>
        <p>The Species level is the most specific classification, identifying individual species. This is typicaly the name used by the species in question to describe itself. In the event the species has a specific classification system for life, their scientific name is used in place of their given name. If neither of these are known at the time a species is classified, the name or ID of their homeworld / planet of discovery is used.</p>

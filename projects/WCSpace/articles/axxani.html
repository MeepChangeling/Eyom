   	 <h4 style="width:68%;">Appearance</h4>
   	 <p>Axxani is a hivemind intelligence native to the planet Gecu in the Lorilia System. They take the form of a species of arthropodic humanoids, with the vast majority of their bioforms being drones of various phenotypes. Due to most of Quite Space's species being mammellian, Axxani has sculpted most of her bioforms to have breast-like features to prevent misgendering. This worked too well, requiring she make them somewhat functional and "soft" after too many people asked her "Do you nurse your young like Grays?"</p>
  	<p>Axxani has several dozen "queen" bodies which serve the same role as a queen ant, but do not house her primary consciousness. Axxani Prime (the term used to designate the body currently housing the bulk of her intellect) is more refined and humanoid than her other bodies, though still possesses a substantial abdomen as it mutates from a queen when the previous one dies.</p>

  	<button type="button" class="collapsible3">Hivemind</button>
   	 <div class="content">
		 <p>There are several different types of hive intelligences known to the Galaxy. Axxani is one of the rarest types, a Class IIb Overmind. An overmind is a hive intelligence where a single mind exists in a state where it has numerous bodies. A Class IIb Overmind creates its own bodies, blank shells without a controlling intelligence making use of them. Furthermore, one of these bodies serves as the core of the intelligence, in a networking sense.</p>
  	<p>Axxani's control over her drones has no real range restrictions. While she experiences input and output lag as a drone gets further from the current Axxani Prime, the delay is a mere 80ms at a distance of 300 ly, and only 92ms at 1400 ly. The size of Quiet Space prevents accurate measurements of lag at larger distances, but it is unlikely for a maximum lag time to exist.</p>
  	<p>Vivisection of several drones (With Axxani's permission) has indicated her bodies are linked through a trans-dimensional resonance of their nervous systems. A drone can be temporarily cut off from the hivemind by interfering with its nervous system, and certain environmental conditions can have the same effect.</p>
  	<p>Axxani knows everything her drones experience. If a drone is killed or otherwise cut off from Axxani she will know what the drone experience at the moment of its death / isolation. The delay is not a buffer.</p>
  	<p>The following is seemingly unique to Axxani. She acts as a singular individual, rather than behaving as other hiveminds. In simpler words, while communing with a typical Class IIb Hive Intelligence would be akin to directly interacting with an artificial superintelligence, Axxani instead acts like a normal individual. While she does have the capabilities one would expect of her class of lifeform, speaking with her is no different than speaking to any single minded individual. Due to Axxani being the last of her kind there is no way to tell if this is normal for her species or a mental condition. Most psychologists lean towards the latter option given her isolation prior to contact.</p>
   	 </div>

  	<p>Nearly all of Axxani's drones follow a general tauric shape. Their lower bodies are supported by four legs, and their upper bodies have two dexterous arms with a slightly greater range of motion than humans. The specific features of each drone depend on its phenotype, of which there are countless different variants as Axxani's drones are fully tailored by her before their egg is laid. Drones can even be mutated once or twice "on the fly" to create unique one-off varients for specific use cases.</p>
  	<p>The major exception to the tauric rule is Axxani Prime and Companion Drones. These are always bipedal. Companions are intentionally designed to be humanoid to better fit in with other species as they provide "less scary" and "less creepy" faces for other species to interact with. Axxani Prime's bipedal state comes from the drone or queen which mutates into her loosing its hind legs in the process for reasons unknown. Indeed, if Axxani Prime were able to retain her hind legs she might not be predominantly immobile.</p>
  	<button type="button" class="collapsible3">Axxani Prime</button>
   	 <div class="content">
		 <p>Axxani Prime should not be thought of as a "queen" in the conventional sense. She is more like a server. Without her, her hivemind operates in a Peer-to-Peer mode. The most observable effect is Axxani's personage will either vanish from a particular drone, or be very clearly operating at a greatly reduced performance level in a manner similar to a computer with a bad connection.</p>
  	<p>If one were to kill Axxani Prime there would be a brief period of disruption lasting up to 48 hours. During this "outage" as she calls them, the majority of her drones running on their previous instructions ("local mode"), or at reduced efficiency with new commands and output distributions ("bad-wifi mode"). Axxani's personage would exist at its normal capacity within her queens, and large groups of drones (at least 300 within a square kilometer).</p>
  	<p>As soon as a bioform has finished mutating into an Axxani Prime, the entire hivemind returns to its normal operation with Axxani's personage existing simultaneously within every drone in equal measure.</p>
   	 </div>

   	 <h4>Environs Typically Inhabited</h4>
   	 <p>Axxani is an example of an aerobe, that being an organism that can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment. She evolved on the savannas of her homeworld, which is quite close to Earth in most respects (Though its gravity is slightly higher and atmosphere slightly thinner.). If she had ambitions of conquest or territorial gain, Earth would be within her sights. Fortunately for Humans, Axxani has no interest in further expansion of herself as she finds existing as the sole person on a world to be excruciatingly lonely.</p>
  	<p>Due to this, Axxani's drones can be found all over the inhabitated parts of Quiet Space, though only where other people are.</p>

   	 <h4>Drone Varieties</h4>

   	 <p>Axxani's bioforms are incredibly diverse, though she does maintain large numbers of a few common forms. She refers to these forms as "Basic", "Worker", "Guard", and "Companion" drones. All of her Bioforms are referred to as "Drones" save for Queens, which she considers as “limbs”, Axxani Prime, which she calls "me" despite it not actually being any form of central intelligence, and Axxani Beta, which serves as a remote body for the Prime.</p>

  	</figure>

  	<div class="indent">
    	<h5 style="width: 71%;">Basic</h5>
    	<p>Basic Drones are exactly what one might expect. A general purpose simple bioform capable of most tasks without any specialty. They are the one bioform Axxani produces which she has not revised, and are thus a glimpse into her species natural evolution.</p>
    	<p>Axxani rarely sends Basic Drones off her homeworld. They have proven to be unnerving to many species and individuals. They serve Axxani's subconscious orders and needs, primarily handling logistics, upkeep, maintenance, and other simple tasks. On the rare occasions they are found offworld they are typically found in academic settings as Axxani is happy to donate Basic Drones to science.</p>

    	<figcaption>Axxani Drone: Worker</figcaption>
  	</figure>

  	<div class="indent">
    	<h5 style="width: 44%; margin-left: 27.25%;">Worker</h5>
    	<p>Workers are Axxani's oldest customized drone. They do not retain their original appearance, but rather are refined generation to generation for the greatest efficiency as general laborers. They have also been lightly modified to have a general feminine shape since Axxani often socialize with non-Axxani workers through these drones.</p>
    	<p>Workers are larger than basic drones, especially in their abdomen, which is large and bloated vertically but not horizontally. This is to accommodate vast internal reserves of nutrients and water, allowing Workers to labor for days on end between meals, even in adverse conditions. Modern Workers are vacuum rated, and capable of working unshielded in the vacuum of space for up to an hour before requiring oxygen. They also retain every modification one might expect. Stronger, faster, more enduring, and improved dexterity and agility over Basic drones.</p>
    	<p>Workers are notable for seeming to enjoy giving bipeds rides. If a Worker is untasked, it might attempt to place a biped on its back and carry them in the direction they were traveling. This is subconscious on Axxani's part, and she'll apologize for it if one prompts the drone to put them down. This behavior exists if the drone is tasked with some form of labor along side bipeds as well. Getting them to not carry humanoid co-workers to the job site is so impossible the various species of Quiet Space have just given up and ensured all Worker cargo packs have a saddle or trailer hitch.</p>
    	<p>By impossible, Axxani herself has attempted to prevent this behavior, but simply cannot. Psychologists have deduced she simply likes to give rides, and when combined with her instinctive need for efficiency in labor, she cannot make the choice to not carry slower workers to the worksite. This has yet to be tested scientifically.</p>

 		 <figcaption>Axxani Drone: Guard</figcaption>
   	 </figure>

  	<div class="indent">
    	<h5 style="width: 71%;">Guard</h5>
    	<p>Guards are a new addition to Axxani's bioforms. As the only intelligent lifeform on her homeworld, she had no need for a bioform specifically for protecting herself and her property from other intelligent lifeforms. Her Basic Drones and Workers were more than sufficient to deal with wild animals. Guards are specifically engineered to deter hostility from other intelligent lifeforms, as well as to kill other intelligent lifeforms. This makes them far more dangerous than most people realize.</p>
    	<p>Guards exoskeletons are designed in a similar fashion to composite layered body armor. The outer layers are reflective in the wavelengths used by most common lasers (hence their white coloration), the midlayer is ablative and fragmentary to break up kinetic projectiles, and the sublayer is an elastic fibrous weave that prevents penetration. THe resulting armor is comparable to light vehicle plating, but only retains its properties when the drone is alive and supplying nutrients to their carapace. Without a study supply of nutrients the material rapidly degenerates into a tar-like substance.</p>
    	<p>Axxani has offered symbiotic armor suit form drones to individuals in the past which make use of the same armor. The downside appears to be a tripling of caloric intake. Guard Drones eat a similar amount and are therefore produced in small numbers. To keep them effective as combatants, Guard Drones have extremely standard hands, allowing them to make use of most equipment designed for other species. They also have a pair of pseudo-limbs on their shoulders which allow them to spray pressurized fluorine-based acid with surprising accuracy.</p>
    	<p>Guards primarily protect Axxani's assets, be they spaceborn or grounded. However she often provides security services for smaller groups, charging food for the drones and a handfull of credits a day. The fee goes up if there are no others on shift for her to talk too.</p>

    	<figcaption>Axxani Drone: Companion</figcaption>
  	</figure>

  	<div class="indent">
    	<h5 style="width: 73%; margin-left: 27.25%;">Companion</h5>
    	<p>Companion Drones are multi-purpose drones roughly on par with Axxani's Basic Drones, with one key difference. They are humanoid. They are designed to interact with other species more easily, and thus engineered to fit in better with the majority of species within Quiet Space. In that vein their limbs have been reduced to but two legs and two arms, and their abdomens have been shrank to the minimum "biologically viable" size.</p>
    	<p>They are still obviously insectoid, with an exoskeleton, antenne, and of course their abdomen. However, as the Companions do not breathe through their exoskeleton (they use their mouth and nose like a mammal) they can wear clothing, are able to speak many languages with ease, and can preform most any physical activity suited for a biped (Only slower and typically with less strength, but greater endurance.).</p>
    	<p>The primary role of Companion Drones is social. They have greater independence capacity than other drones, though not as much as Queens. In the event of a "Network Outage" Companions can choose new actions to take and have a limited capability to continue conversations. Anything they do is something Axxani would have done herself, though not necessarily the most likely thing to have chosen to do.</p>
    	<p>Companions can be found anywhere Axxani has been able to locate a public-facing job which was willing to hire her. They are shopkeepers, doctors, DJs, wait staff, everything one can imagine. This role is not as filled out as Axxani would like, and so she has given many COmpanion Drones for private use by individuals as live-in staff, assistants, secretaries, everything under the sun save for romantic or sexual services. If asked about this apparent gap in services offered and Axxani's "happy to please" nature, Axxani is on record as saying "But I don't like them that way?"</p>
  	</div>

  	<figure data-augmented-ui="tl-2-clip-x tr-2-clip-y br-clip-x bl-clip border" class="styleme articleFigure floatR" style="margin-right: 1em; width: 33%;">
    	<img src="../img/aliens/AxxiDroneQ.webp" alt="" class="articleImg">
    	<figcaption>Axxani Queen</figcaption>
  	</figure>

  	<h4 style="width: 63%;">Queens</h4>
  	<p>Axxani Queens are drones by biological classification, but not by Axxani's Network System. Queens are produced primarily from eggs laid by Axxani Prime (With some small numbers coming from Basic Drones) and serve, in her words, as "Mobile drone factories with built in routers." This is accurate though due to their massive abdominis, Queens are less mobile than that description might make you think.</p>
  	<p>Queens serve the Network as either central hubs for a Local Group of Drones (Equivalent to a small town or city district in size) or as a middle-man between the first type of Queens and Axxani Prime or another middle-man Queen. This arrangement functions exactly identical to a Computer Network with Drones being equivalent to individual devices and Queens acting as routers or servers with the ultimate goal of creating a chain of linkages from Drone to Axxani Prime.</p>
  	<p>If a Queen is killed, the drones "downstream" will act in the same way as if the Prime was killed, unless of course there is another Queen in the link between them and the Prime. Queens have a finite capacity of Drones they can actively control (Exactly 512), but can give Drones instructions that will be carried out without active control, allowing them to manage a maximum of 1,024 Drones each. For more Drones to be used with any efficiency a Colony will require another Queen at this population level. Axxani has made Queens with "more RAM" as she puts it, but "They just need too much food to be economical."</p>
  	<p>Queens can act independently if the Prime is disabled. This is not due to them being their own individuals but rather due to Axxani herself being more firmly anchored to Queens than Drones (Drones are mostly active in her subconscious unless she's paying one special attention. Typically when it's interacting with another species.). When Axxani makes a friend, she typically spawns a Queen especially for them, assigning that Queen to handle all friendly relations between herself and the individual in question. This has, on occasion, resulted in the emergences of Colonies specifically dedicated to tending to the needs of a single individual.</p>
  	<p>If rumors are to be believed, Axxani has created a small army of Queens specifically to orbitaly drop them onto Earth to immediately begin constructing modern infrastructure across the Globe as soon as Earth's governments agree to join their interstellar community.</p>

  	<h4>Axxani Prime</h4>
  	<p>Axxani Prime is a unique bioform (in so far as there being one of them at a time) which serves as the central server of Axxani's hive intelligence. It routes traffic, connects all branches, and manages the overall direction of the hive. It is the body from which Axxani issues orders to her constituent parts, coordinates her activities, and all other command functions. These occurs subconsciously. Axxani Prime's conscious mind is simply Axxani, unfiltered by bioform needs.</p>
  	<p>Axxani calls Axxani Prime "me" which isn't an unfair claim. There is a uniqueness to interactions with Axxani that occurs only when speaking to a Prime. She feels sharper, wittier, and faster to respond then when interacting even with her Queens.</p>
  	<p>An interesting note on a Prime's biology is she is bipedal rather than quadrupedal. When a Queen or Drone mutates into a Prime, its rear legs meld with her abdomen, creating supports and additional powerful muscles to help her move the tremendously large appendage. This is important as the Prime's other function is egg production. Unlike a Queen, Axxani Prime's eggs hatch within days and produce fully grown drones. Her abdomen is therefore much larger than the rest of her body, growing up to the size of a shipping container depending on what Axxani is choosing to lay.</p>
  	<p>Axxani is rather shy about showing her Prime body to most people. This appears to be embarrassment related to being largely immobile (the Prime is only capable of moving approximately 200 meters a day without assistance). Axxani has created a second unique Bioform which shares many traits with Primes to compensate for this.</p>

  	<figure data-augmented-ui="tl-2-clip-x tr-2-clip-y br-clip-x bl-clip border" class="styleme articleFigure floatL" style="margin-right: 1em; width: 30%;">
    	<img src="../img/aliens/AxxiDroneB.webp" alt="" class="articleImg">
    	<figcaption>Axxani Beta</figcaption>
  	</figure>

  	<h4 style="margin-left: 33%;">Axxani Beta</h4>
  	<p>Axxani Beta is a unique purpose crafted bioform which acts as a directly link to Axxani Prime. There is functionally no difference in interacting between the two in terms of how it feels to interact with her. The secondary reason for Axxani Beta's existence appears to be embarrassment at Axxani Prime being largely immobile. The main reason is "I wanted a Prime that looked as human as possible. Something they might hang out with, that could possibly go and do things with them."</p>
  	<p>Axxani Beta is not a total success in this respect. While she is sterile her abdomen is still quite large and bloats substantially with nutrients after eating (as is true of the Prime). This can make doors difficult for her. However, she is capable of walking nearly as far as the average human.</p>
  	<p>Axxani was kind enough to explain the reason for the bulk. Rather than carrying reproductive equipment, Beta's abdomen houses the bio-neural circuitry which allows for the same connectivity as a Prime. This level of link requires a good deal of energy expenditure, thus the need for extra food reserves on top of the transceiver package. To quote Axxani "There simply wasn't any other place to put them without making Beta twice her current height, which matches most human females. So... Screw it. Someone on Earth will think it's cute. You know?"</p>
  	<p>Axxani Beta has thus far not left her homeworld.</p>


   	 <h4>History</h4>
   	 <p>Axxani is the sole survivor of her species. They evolved as hiveminds, with at least twenty six intelligences arising with their species. As far as Axxani can tell from what little writings remain her species is incapable of handling the scent of another of their own kind's bioforms resulting in inevitable deadly conflicts. Due to her species intelegences being the one person many bodies variety, her ancestors eventually entered into a war of total genocide. Axxani has no idea of how the others died out, only that it was several hundred years before she hatched.</p>
  	<p>Axxani arose from a single egg in a small hidden nursery chamber located in the south of her homeworld's largest savannah. She was alone her entire life, spending nearly 8,000 years developing a modern civilization from scratch. All of her knowledge of her ancestors comes from their ruins and writings, which based on their crude pictographic script never developed complex writing. The writings are easily understandable as the pictographs are more like comic book panels than refined characters. All independent translations verify Axxani's version of events (as does carbon dating of her oldest structures and her ancestor's latest artifacts).</p>
  	<p>Fortunately for the galaxy, Axxani is not hostile. Her prolonged isolation led to her developing a crippling fear of being alone in the universe. She was so delighted to meet other intelligences upon reaching the stars that she didn't mind the previous administration quarantining her to her homeworld, provided they sent people to keep her company. Due to the quarantine expiring and the current administration seemingly not caring about Axxani specifically, the denizens of Quiet Space encouraged Axxani to venture to the stars. She eagerly accepted.</p>
  	<p>Axxani is crucial to Quiet Space's diplomatic efforts and commerce due to her love of language and near-instant link to her drones. These allow her to provide nearly real-time translation to ship captains all across the sector. Axxani has a love of building, but hates to build things for herself (it brings back memories of isolation). She is often contracted as a construction worker for projects across the sector. She also offers soldier drones as security officers, though this service is far less popular.</p>
  	<button type="button" class="collapsible3">Translation</button>
   	 <div class="content">
		 <p>In liu of universal translators, Axxani provides translation services for Quiet Space. Her drones can be found aboard all official starships (usually 3-4 of them for workload balancing) and most civilian captains will hire a drone for their own needs as well.</p>
  	<p>Axxani's translation is nothing high tech, she simply takes the time to learn each and every language. A task that's functionally invisible to a hive intelligence, as is the workload of translating. Axxani is happy to translate formal or conversational speech, as well as technical documents and works of narrative fiction, but expresses disinterest and a lack of confidence in translating plays, songs, and cutting edge scientific papers. The latter is due to her current limitations in understanding the outer bounds of science.</p>
  	<p>While Axxani is a very capable scientist she is not a genius. It takes her time to learn new concepts, and if the experts in a field she wishes to learn do not have a full working knowledge of that field (as is normal for the cutting edge of science) Axxani feels it is prudent to wait rather than accidently spread misinformation due to her own understanding of a subject being wrong or incomplete.</p>

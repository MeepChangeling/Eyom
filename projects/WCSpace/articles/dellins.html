    	<h4>Appearance</h4>
    	<p>Dellins are tall, bipedal, reptilian humanoids with many qualities similar to Earth's newts and salamanders. They are typically earthen in color, with many looking alike save for their patterns of spots on the darker sections of their skin. These differences are not something Dellins are especially sensitive to, as such they wear jewelry and particular clothing styles to help differentiate one another at a glance. Biologically, Dellin's voices are very distinct and have unique melodic patterns and cadences. This is how Dellin's tell one another apart normally.</p>
  	<p>Unlike Earth's reptiles, Dellins have hair. It's thicker and stronger than typical hair, with qualities that make it a defensive rather than decorative feature (Dellin makes make it difficult to bite the back of their head or neck. The tuft on their tail tips often tricks native preditors.). Also notable is the Dellin's chests, which appear to have breast tissue. Dellins are not mammals. Their "breasts" are storage for a two-part chemical mix that combusts when mixed and then exposed to oxygen. The chemicals are sprayed through channels in the moulth wit the aid of the pectoral musciles, capilary action, and exhalation. The average Dellin can spray flames over 40 feet.</p>
  	<p>Dellin's legs are "transitory" and able to swap between plantigrade and digitigrade stances at will. This process is largely automatic, with Dellins using digitigrade stances for speed, and plantigrade for traction or endurance. Their feet end in talons, though their claws are mostly suitable for digging and burrowing. Their hands end in the same type of claws. Dellin claws can abrade soft stones like sandstone, limestone, travertine, and soapstone.</p>
  	<p>Dellin Eyes are very human-like in appearance, and function almost identically (albeit with slightly worse depth perception and slightly greater dynamic range). The skin around their eyes contain thermal receptive photocells which allow them to see heat. Their visual cortex processes both visual and thermal wavelengths, overlaying the data within their minds. To a Dellin, there is no perceptible difference between "visible light" and "heat".</p>
  	<p>Dellins are hermaphroditic, but bear a strong resemblance to mammalian females. Their lack of sexual dimorphism is not only physical but mental. Dellins do not differ in reproductive behavior, they are all perfectly happy to preform either reproductive role. In simple terms, Dellins not only have one sex but also one gender (This tends to creep most other species out the longer they live around Dellins.). It logically follows that their languages lack gender pronouns due to never having a need for them until their first contact with other intelligent life.</p>
  	<p>In liu of pronouns, Dellins typically request other species to refer to them as females due to their morphology making that the easiest for others to utilise. Individuals wishing to respect biological differences between species can use the Delic word "y̌ing" in place of a pronoun as it means personage, persona, or self depending on context. However, Dellins will simply use people's names or their singular possessive term "kii" <i>(pron. key)</i> when speaking their own language and referring to individuals, effectively using context to replace pronouns.</p>

  	<h4>Dellin Fire</h4>
  	<p>Dellin's flaming breath is typically envisioned as a cone of flames similar to the results of lighting an aerosol product aflame. Their flame functions using high pressure generated by their pectorals to squirt two streams of liquid at high pressure. Combustion occurs when the fluids mix together, and then with oxygen, a short distance outside of their mouth. The pressurized jet of burning liquid has properties similar to Earth weapons such as Napalm and White Phosphorus. Their flames can be banked off of hard surfaces, angled to splash across a large area, or even "Swirled in the air" to create a thick column of flame. It also burns on or under water.</p>
  	<p>A Dellin can breathe fire for 8 seconds on average. It takes several days to replenish their flames, during which time the Dellin will be ravenously hungry. A common question regarding Dellin physiology in relation to their flames is "Does the size of their chest indicate how full their reservoirs are?" In a word, no. Breathing fire does not diminish the size of a Dellin's breasts. However the firmness does change with the fluid level, and their volume does decrease when the Dellin is actively ejecting fule to burn due to compression.</p>



    	<h4>Environs Typically Inhabited</h4>
    	<p>Dellins are native to the planet Del, which is mostly desert. Dellins inhabit the coastal forests of their homeworld, with occasional populations based around oases within the deserts. Dellins are extremely adaptable, and could in theory inhabit any oxygenated planet with O2 levels between 18 and 29 percent. However, they value comfort and ease of living more than growth and will stick to regions close to their ideal living conditions (Warm, humid, access to water, lots of clays) unless forced to move.</p>
  	<p>Planet-side Dellin homes are always built from stone, typically by digging into a cliffside (they will remove as much dirt as necessary from a hillside to expose a bare rock face). This is for thermoregulation purposes, as the stone is used as a thermal mass for in-floor heating/cooling systems. Dellins do not mind the lack of natural light as they navigate underwater and below ground using their thermal sense.</p>
  	<p>Dellins especially hate space habitats, primarily due to how much difficulty there is in creating a high-humidity space habitat which will not corrode quickly, or be extremely vulnerable to space debris. Dellins who choose to live in space are almost exclusively mutants. These mutants, called evřu dvawdhaǐ (Eng. Mouth Breathers, short evřu), do not resperate through their skin nearly as much as normal Dellins. Consequently, they do not need humidity to feel comfortable. While they are often outcasts from larger populations, evřu preform the bulk of Dellish space based labor.</p>

    	<h4>Life Cycle</h4>
    	<p>The planet Del is notable for its evolutionary path favoring Autogamy <i>(Self-fertilization)</i> as the primary means of reproduction amongst complex multicellular lifeforms. Dellins are one of the few exceptions to this trend as they reproduce sexually but like most species on their homeworld are hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs and are fully capable of fulfilling either reproductive role.</p>
  	<button type="button" class="collapsible3">Dellin Reproductive Cellular Biology</button>
    	<div class="content">
    	<p>Dellin reproduction makes use of a method unique to their planet called Dynamic Recombative Eventual Zygote Consistency or DREZC<i>(aka TIHI or Thanks, I hate it!)</i>. The system is what the name implies. Allow us to explain.</p>
    	<p>Mos lifeforms on Del are isogamous species. This means their gametes have the same size and shape, such that telling male and female gametes apart is not easy. So much so that rather than being labeled as "male" and "female" or even "egg" and "sperm", the terms "positive" and "negative" are used. This method of reproduction is typically found in molds on Earth.</p>
    	<p>For Dellins specifically, positive gametes are produced in their equivalent of a male reproductive system. These cells are mobile and contain a smaller packet of DNA which serves as an activation catalyst for the negative gametes. The majority of the cell's contents are nutrients for the negative gametes and data encoded into RNA sequences. Yes. Data.</p>
    	<p>The Positive cells carry 3-5 years worth of medical data in the form of recordings of hormone levels, signal sequences that correlate to different injuries, stress responses to environmental pressures, and more. This data is easily red, so much so it's been used in Dellin medical exams for centuries.</p>
    	<p>Negative cells contain structures to read DNA and RNA, then preform genetic resequencing operations based on that data. They also contain a full copy of the mother's chromosome to use as a base for editing. Both negative and positive cells are mobile and will seek their opposite charge. If a negative cell encounters a positive cell with a different activation catalyst sequence than is contained in their creator's chromosome, it will assimilate that cell and begin editing its chromosome package using the data it has just acquired.</p>
    	<p>These edits are the functional equivalent of random mutations in that they adapt the offspring to environmental pressures... Except the adaptation is intelligently selected via their parents experiences and encoded using a natural algorithmic process on par with modern medicine's genetic editing technologies. The end result is a child perfectly adapted to the location and current events in which it was conceived.</p>
    	<p>The above process is the Dynamic Recombative part of DREZC.</p>
    	<p>This process does not occur once per child. Dellins mix millions of gametes when reproducing. Each Zygote will be slightly different to its peers due to random chance, small differences in data packets, and biological errors. Eventual Zygote Consistency is a process by which Dellin Zygotes locate one another and fuze, executing their recombination process again to average the chromosome sequence of each zygote, and in turn, each amalgamation of zygotes.</p>
    	<p>After several days, all zygotes within a Dellin will have melded into an embryo which contains a single genetic sequence that has been created through this averaging in a naturally occuring form of data correction. No species on Del, Dellins included, shows any signs of genetic engineering, nor are they synthetic organic lifeforms. This process evolved on their homeworld.</p>
    	</div>

  	<p>Aside from the quirks of isogamous fertilization, Dellin reproduction is quite standard for a reptilian species. Their young develop in their mothers for a short time, are laid as embryos contained within a hard shelled egg, and hatch after an incubation period. Dellin hatchlings are able to walk within hours of hatching, and can swim immediately. This is important as Dellins incubate their eggs underwater, using water to keep them at the appropriate temperature.</p>

  	<div class="indent">
    	<h5>Bio Castes</h5>
    	<p>Dellins have biological castes. While not overtly polymorphic each Dellin caste will have their body altered to better perform their caste's role. The primary effect of these casts is a mental compulsion to perform a specific type of activity. For example, a Dellin of the Burrower caste is compelled to spend at least some of their time digging or otherwise creating earthworks. Meanwhile members of the Chief caste are compelled to organize, lead, plan, and administer other's labors.</p>
    	<p>There are many castes, far too many to list in a summary, yet the number is finite and covers the majority of tasks a sapient tool using species would need to survive. There are castes for everything from labor, to administration, to security, to entertainment, and more. These castes do not lock their members into any specific social role, any member of a caste can still preform any role, it's simply that they have a particular talent for a certain social role.</p>
    	<p>Dellins take their castes seriously, but do not allow them to rule over them. This is primarily because castes are not inheritable. They appear to be randomly selected when a Dellin zygote is formed. Which is admittedly unusual for a species that passes environmental information to their young for adaptation purposes.</p>
  	</div>

    	<h4>History</h4>
    	<p>The Dellins are a old race. Their history speaks of the ancient days before the <a href="GalacticPulse.html">Galactic Pulse</a>, a natural cosmic disaster which occurred approximately 5 million years ago. According to their ancestors, they were in talks with the <a href="ElyndariDominion.html">Elyndari Dominion</a> to join their empire as vassals when the Pulse hit. As a pre-space flight civilization the Dellins were spared however the cataclysm did convince them to abandon the idea of space travel.</p>
  	<p>Dellins spent the majority of the time since the disaster perfecting their needs as a species and building their planet into a paradise, as they intended to never leave it. Indeed, even after first contact with the <a href="JirrinEmpire.html">Jirrin Empire</a> 800 years ago, they did not leave their planet until representatives of the <a href="#">Stellar Empire Intercooperation Organization</a> were able to demonstrate to them that modern shields, communication systems, and FTL engines could withstand the Pulse long enough to reach a safe planet to shelter out the storm, and also explain what the Pulse was and how it will take tens of millions of years for another Pulse to even be possible.</p>
  	<p>Upon their return to space, the Dellins continued with their general practice of "standing tall", developing and fortifying their home system, Kass (Known to Earth as Gliese 514). It wasn't until the last 70 years that Dellins have elected to explore the sector, or rather, part of the sector. That part being the Sol system, most notably Sol III (aka Earth).</p>
  	<p>Dellins decided to begin exploring the sector with Earth on the recommendation of a unnamed <a href="grays.html">Gray</a> who reportedly told them to "Check out these ape's food. You can eat everything they can, and their cooking is fucking great!" As chance would have it, the Dellins universally agree with this assessment. They have been sneaking individual craft to Earth daily for years, employing several forms of disguise to obtain Earth food and deliver it back to their home system (A mere 20 minute flight for most Dellin craft).</p>
  	<p>Dellins have attempted to contribute their own culture's culinary arts to Earth as part of their policy of fair exchange. Foods created by Dellins include:</p>
  	<ul>
    	<li>Hawaiian Pizza (Albeit the pineapple is supposed to be grilled prior to being placed on the pizza.)</li>
    	<li>Savory Jello based entrees (Apparently a <i>successful</i> attempt to replicate various stuffed slug dishes from Del.)</li>
    	<li>Spam</li>
    	<li>Stinkheads (General advisory: do not look up what this dish is.)</li>
    	<li>Wasp Crackers (Warning: Literally what you think they are.)</li>
    	<li>The Marmite & apple sandwich (Warning: Marmite is a deadly toxin for Grays.)</li>
  	</ul>

    	<h4>Appearance</h4>
    	<p>Dellins are tall, bipedal, reptillian humanoids with many qualities simmilar to Earth's newts and salamanders. They are typicaly earthen in color, with many looking alike save for their paterns of spots on the darker sections of their skin. These diffrences are not something Dellins are especialy sensative to, as such they wear jewlry and particualr lcothing styles to help diofrenchiate one another at a glance. Biologicaly, Dellin's voices are very distinct and have unique melodic paterns and cadences. This is how Dellin's tell one another appart normaly.</p>
      <p>Unlike Earth's reptiles, Dellins have hair. It's thicker and stronger than typical hair, with qualities that make it a defensive rather than decorative feature (Dellin makes make it difficult to bite the back of their head or neck. The tuft on their tail tips often tricks native preditors.). Also notable is the Dellin's chests, which appear to have breast tissue. Dellins are not mammels. Their "breasts" are in truth exceptionaly strong pectoral musciles for propelling a two-part chemical mix that combusts when mixed and then exposed to oxygen.</p>
      <p>Dellin's legs are "transatory" and able to swap between planigrade and digigrade stances at will. This process is largly automatic, with Dellins using digitigrade stances for speed, and planitgrade for traction or endurance. Their feet end in talons, though their claws are mostly suitable for digging and burrowing. Their hands end in the same type of claws. Dellin claws can abrade soft stones like standstone, limestone, travertine, and soapstone.</p>
      <p>Dellin Eyes are very human-like in apperance, and function almost identicaly (albiet with slightly worse depth perceptoion and slightly greater dynamic range). The skin arround their eyes contain thermal receptive photocells which allow them to see heat. Thieir visual cortex processes both visual and thermal wavelenghts, overlaying the data within their minds. To a Dellin, there is no perceptable diffrence between "visible light" and "heat".</p>
      <p>Dellins are hermaphraditic, but bear a strong resembelence to mammallian females. Their lack of sexual dimorphism is not only physical but mental. Dellins do not differ in reproductive behavior, they are all prefectly happy to preform either rprodutive role. In simple terms, Dellins not only have one sex but also one gender (This tends to creep most other species out the longer they live arround Dellins.). It logicaly follows that their languages lack gender pronouns due to never having a need for them untill their first contact with other intelegent life.</p>
      <p>In liu of pronouns, Dellins typicaly request other speices to refer to them as females due to their morphology making that the easiest for others to utilise. Individuals wishing to respect biological diffrences between species can use the Delic word "y̌ing" in place of a pronoun as it means personage, persona, or self depending on context. Howeaver, Dellins will simply use people's names or their singular posessive term "kii" <i>(pron. key)</i> when speaking their own langauge and refering to individuals, effectivly using context to replace pronouns.</p>

      <h4>Dellin Fire</h4>
      <p>Dellin's flaming breath is typicaly envisioned as a cone of flames simmilar to the results of lighting an aresol product aflame. Their flame functions using high pressure generated by their pectorals to squirt two streams of liquid at high pressure. Combustion occures when the fluids mix togeather, and then with oxygen, a short distance outside of their moulth. The pressurised jet of burning liquid has properties simmilar to Earth weapons such as Napalm and White Phospherious. Their flames can be banked off of hard surfices, angled to splash across a large area, or even "Swirled in the air" to create a thick column of flame. It also burns on or under water.</p>
      <p>A Dellin can breathe fire for 8 seconds on average. It takes several days to replenish their flames, durring which time the Dellin will be raveniously hungry. A common question reguarding Dellin physiology in relation to their flames is "Does the size of their chest indicate how full their resavores are?" In a word, no. Breathing fire does not dimish the size of a Dellin's breasts. Howeaver the firmness does change with the fluid level, and their volume does decreace when the Dellin is activly ejecting fule to burn due to compression.</p>



    	<h4>Environs Typically Inhabited</h4>
    	<p>Dellins are native to the planet Del, which is mostly desert. Dellins inhabit the coastal forestes of their homeowrld, with occasional populations based arround oasises within the deserts. Dellins are extreemly adaptable, and could in theroy inhabit any oxygenated planet with O2 levels between 18 and 29 percent. Howeaver, they value comfort and ease of living more than growth and will stick to regions close to their ideal living conditions (Warm, humid, access to water, lots of clays) unless forced to move.</p>
      <p>Planet-side Dellin homes are always built from stone, typicaly by digging into a cliffside (they will remove as much dirt as nessisary from a hillside to expose a bare rock face). This is for thermoregulation purposes, as the stone is used as a thermal mass for in-floor heating/cooling systems. Dellins do not mind the lack of natural light as they navigate underwater and below ground using their thermal sence.</p>
      <p>Dellins espeicaly hate space habatats, primarily due to how much difficulty there is in creating a hihg-humidity space habitat which will not corrode quickly, or be extreemly vulnerable to space debries. Dellins who choose to live in space are almost exclusivly mutants. These mutants, called evřu dvawdhaǐ (Eng. Moulth Breathers, short evřu), do not resperate through their skin nearly as much as normal Dellins. Concequently, they do not need humidity to feel comfortable. While they are often outcasts from larger populations, evřu preform the bulk of Dellish space based labor.</p>

    	<h4>Life Cycle</h4>
    	<p>The planet Del is notable for its evolutionary path favoring Autogamy <i>(Self-fertilization)</i> as the primary means of reproduction amongst complex multi-cellular lifeforms. Dellins are one of the few exceptions to this trend as they reproduce sexualy but like most species on their homeworld are hermaphroditic, posessing both male and female rproductive organs and are fully capable of fufilling either reproductive role.</p>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible3">Dellin Reproduictive Cellular Biology</button>
    	<div class="content">
        <p>Dellin reproduction makes use of a method unique to their planet called Dynamic Recombative Eventual Zygote Consistancy or DREZC<i>(aka TIHI or Thanks, I hate it!)</i>. The system is what the name implies. Allow us to explain.</p>
        <p>Mos tlieforms on Del are isogamous species. This means their gametes have the same size and shape, such that telling male and female gametes appart is not easy. So much so that rather than being labled as "male" and "female" or even "egg" and "sperm", the terms "posative" and "negative" are used. This method of reproduction is typicaly found in molds on Earth.</p>
        <p>For Dellins specificaly, posative gammetes are produced in their equivilent of a male reproductive system. These cells are mobile and contain a smaller packet of DNA which serves as an activation catalyst for the negative gammetes. The majority of the cell's contents are nutrients for the negative gametes and data encoded into RNA sequences. Yes. Data.</p>
        <p>The Posative cells carry 3-5 years worth of medical data in the form of recordings of hormone levels, signal sequences that corrolate to diffrent injuries, stress responces to environmental pressures, and more. This data is easily red, so much so it's been used in Dellin medical exams for centuries.</p>
        <p>Negative cells contain structures to read DNA and RNA, then preform genetic resequencing operations based on that data. They also contain a full copy of the mother's chromosome to use as a base for editing. Both negative and posative cells are mobile and will seek their oppsite charge. If a negative cell encounters a posative cell with a diffrent activation catalyst sequence than is contained in their creator's chromosome, it will assimilate that cell and begin editing its chromosome package using the data it has just accuired.</p>
        <p>These edits are the functional equivilent of random mutations in that they adapt the offspring to environmental pressures... Except the adaptation is intelegently selected via their parents experiances and encoded using a natural algorythmic process on par with modern medicine's genetic editing technologies. The end result is a child prefectly adapted to the location and current events in which it was concieved.</p>
        <p>The above process is the Dynamic Recombative part of DREZC.</p>
        <p>This process does not occure once per child. Dellins mix millions of gametes when reproducing. Each Zygote will be slightly difrrent to its peers due to random chance, small diffrences in data packets, and biological errors. Eventual Zygote Consistancy is a process by which Dellin Zygotes locate one another and fuze, exicuting their recombative process again to average the chromosome sequence of each zygote, and in turn, each amagamation of zygotes.</p>
        <p>After several days, all zygotes within a Dellin will have melded into an embryo which contains a single genetic sequence that has been created through this averaging in a naturaly occuring form of data correction. No species on Del, Dellins included, shows any signs of gentic engineering, nor are they synthetic organic lifeforms. This process evolved on their homeworld.</p>
    	</div>

      <p>Asside from the quirks of isogamous fertilization, Dellin reproduction is quite standard for a reptillian species. Their young develop in their mothers for a short time, are laied as embryos contained within a hard shelled egg, and hatch after an incubation piriod. Dellin hatchlings are able to walk within hours of hatching, and can swim imeadiantly. This is important as Dellins incubate their eggs underwater, using water to keep them at the appropriate tempature.</p>

    	<h4>History</h4>
    	<p>The Dellins are a old race. Their history speaks of the ancient days before the <a href="GalacticPulse.html">Galactic Pulse</a>, a natural cosmic disaster which occured aproximently 2,500 years ago arround the year 500 BCE. According to their ancestors, they were in talks with the <a href="ElyndariDominion.html">Elyndari Dominion</a> to join their empire as vassles when the Pulse hit. As a pre-space flight civilization the Dellins were spared howeaver the cataclysm did convince them to abandon the idea of space travel for milinia.</p>
      <p>Dellins spent the majority of the time since the disaster prefecting their needs as a species and building their planet into a paradice, as they intended to never leave it. Indeed, even after first contact with the <a href="JirrinEmpire.html">Jirrin Empire</a> 800 years ago, they did not leave their planet untill reprentatives of the <a href="#">Steller Empire Intercoperation Organization</a> were able to demonstrate to them that modern shields, communication systems, and FTL engines could withstand the Pulse long enough to reach a safe planet to shelter out the storm, and also explain what the Pulse was and how it will take tens of millions of years for another Pulse to even be possible.</p>
      <p>Oppon their return to space, the Dellins continued with their general prractice of "standing tall", developing and fortiofying their home system, Kass (Known to Earth as Gliese 514). It wasn't untill the last 70 years that Dellins have elected to explore the sector, or rather, part of the sector. That part being the Sol system, most notably Sol III (aka Earth).</p>
      <p>Dellins decided to begin exploring the ector with Earth on the reccomentation of a unnamed <a href="grays.html">Gray</a> who reportedly told them to "Check out these ape's food. You can eat everything they can, and their cooking is fucking great!" As chance would have it, the Dellins universaly agree with this assessment. They have been sneeking individual craft to Earth daily for years, employing several forms of disguise to obtain Earth food and deliver it back to their home system (A mere 20 minute flight for most Dellin craft).</p>
      <p>Dellins have attempted to contribute their own cullture's cullinary arts to Earth as part of their policy of fair exchange. Foods created by Dellins include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hawaiian Pizza (Albiet the pineapple is supposed to be grilled prior to being placed on the pizza.)</li>
        <li>Savory Jello based entrees (Apparently a <i>successful</i> attempt to replciate various stuffed slug dishes from Del.)</li>
        <li>Spam</li>
        <li>Stinkheads (General advisory: do not look up what this dish is.)</li>
        <li>Wasp Crackers (Warining: Litteraly what you think they are.)</li>
        <li>The Marmite & apple sandwich (Warning: Marmite is a deadly toxin for Grays.)</li>
      </ul>

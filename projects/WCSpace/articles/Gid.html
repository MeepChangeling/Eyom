You strapped a monkey to the top of a repurposed bomb and flung them into space without any idea of what would happen to them. How dare you. How dare you give a mindless animal the glory and awe of riding a god damn one-stroke engine out of the stratosphere into the cold embrase of the void? We're way better monkies than those drooling morons! You could have let one of us have the coolest ride into orbet ever, but NOOOOOOO! Lets get something straight. From this point forward, if you need brave volenteers, or stupid volenteers, for anything even a hundreth that cool you come to us. Okay? Even if there is a hundred percent chance of dyuing of death by space, we'll be first in line. Got it?"</p>

    	<h4>Codex</h4>
  	<div class="indent">
    	<p><b>Name:</b> Gid / Gids<br>
      	<b>Sexes:</b> Male and Female (No sexual dimorphism).<br>
      	<b>Height:</b> 142 - 157 cm (4'8" - 5'2").<br>
      	<b>Weight:</b> 29 - 33 kg (65 - 73 lbs.).<br>
      	<b>Hair:</b> Orange, Dark Orange, Aerospace Orange, Tangelo, Fire Orange, Autumn Orange, and rarely Burnt Umber. <br>
      	<b>Eyes:</b> Matches hair color.<br>
      	<b>Skin:</b> A Gid's skin is extremely resistant to radiation. Common colors include: Slate, Charcoal, Midnight Gray, Gunmetal, Stone Gray. Very rarely a Gid can have Xanadu colored skin, these individuals will have various health problems (Similar to albino humans).<br>
      	<b>Spots:</b> Gid have freckle-like spots on their cheeks, nose, shoulders, chests, backs, and along the full length of their tails. <br>
      	<b>Tail:</b> Gid's have prehensile tails which are able to support their full body weight. Their tails are hairless and have a blunt end. They can coil their tail around medium sized objects to manipulate them, but lack the dexterity to manipulate small objects or activate delicute mechanisms with them. The end of their tails are hard and bony, allowing them to be used similar to a flail for self defense.<br>
      	<b>Hands:</b> Gid's hands are remarkably human-like, save for having six fingers.<br>
      	<b>Feet:</b> Gid's feet are human-like, but like their hands have six digits which are notably longer than human toes. They can grip surfaces with their feet with moderate strength, but lack an opposable digit on their feat. This greatly limits what can be done with the foot. Most Gid never bother trying to use their feet for anything but aiding in climbing extremely rough surfaces, and will typically wear shoes engineered to facilitate climbing.<br>
      	<b>Breasts:</b> Gid are mammals and nurse their young. Both sexes develop four temporary breasts (two rows of two) when either they or a female they live in close proximity with enters her third trimester. In most cases a Gid's breasts recede after four years, though they can become permanent if an individual has a set of recessive genes.

    	<h4>Appearance</h4>
    	<p>The Gid are extremely similar to humans by most species reckoning. The primary differences being the Gid are shorter, weaker, have tails, and lack sexual dimorphism (Meaning one cannot tell their males and females apart without checking their genitalia.).</p>
  	<p>Humans will take note of more differences due to the overall similarity. Gid evolved from monkey-like creatures on their homeworld, which shows in their smaller stature, greatly dexterous six-fingered hands, and their general energetic temperances. Further differences include their relative uniformity of skin tones and hair colors. Gid have much less variety in appearance than humans do, though have far more variation in pheromones. They also move with far more grace. Humans tend to describe Gid movement as "catlike".</p>
  	<p>While Gid can tell their males and females apart via scent, it is typically impossible for other species to tell them apart visually as their males make use of a genetle slit. Close examination is required to determine the difference. Due to this, Gid do not take offense if openly asked what their sex or gender is.</p>
  	<p>Behaviorally, Gid can be said to be highly energetic, prone to over focusing on specific tasks, and easily distractible. They retain a lot of instincts from their arboreal ancestors, loving to climb and design their habitats with plenty of elevation changes and vertical accessways.</p>

    	<h4>Environs Typically Inhabited</h4>
    	<p>The Gid's homeworld is long lost, though the are native to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55_Cancri_e">Janssen</a> system. Their homeworld is known to have had less radiation protection than Earth, leading to the Gid's black/gray complexions as a necessary survival adaptation.</p>
  	<p>Whatever environments the Gid evolved to inhabit is largely irrelevant. They have fully rejected planetary civilization in favor of a nomadic spacer lifestyle. The Gid inhabit many small fleets of ships and make use of mobile space stations to set up "camp" and travel the area around them for fun. They have established a few more permanent camps, but as their populations rotate regularly they are not considered permanently inhabited.</p>
  	<p>The Gid's sense of exploration and adventure are exceptionally high, and have led them to develop technological means of surviving nearly any environment. While they are capable of handling anything a human could without their equipment, with it they have been known to set up temporary cities on some of the most harsh planets.</p>
  	<div class="indent">
    	<h4>Baltis Camp</h4>
    	<p>The Gid have a permanent camp located on the planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus">Venus</a> in the Sol system. It is located within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltis_Vallis">Baltis Vallis</a> channel at 37.308°N 161.412°E. The camp is typically inhabited by 300 Gid and used as a day spa known for "Pleasant Vistas". Naturally to have good views the structure is located on the planet's surface. The planet in question being Venus. That is to say Sol II. On its surface. Just, out in the open.</p>
    	<p>Humans familiar with your neighboring planet should now understand precisely how capable the Gid are in terms of creating an inhabitable space.</p>
  	</div>
  	<p>Gid prefer to spend the majority of their time in space. While they do not object to artificial gravity systems, they prefer structures which make use of rotational forces to simulate gravity. Unlike most species they happily inhabit every "layer" of the rotating parts, simply transitioning from walking to climbing when gravity becomes too low for walking to be practical. The change in gravitational force and rotation doesn't cause them disorientation, as their 3000 years as a spacer species have started to bear fruit in the form of adaptations to space itself.</p>
  	<p>These adaptations include not losing muscle mass in space, a higher resistance to radiation dmage (While their skin makes them quite resistant to radiation, they are not immune), intuitive understanding of motion within microgravity, as well as greater flexibility and reach.</p>

    	<h4>Life Cycle</h4>
    	<p>Gid have a lifecycle roughly identical to humans. They age at approximately the same rate, have similar lifespans, and mature roughly as quickly as each other.</p>
  	<p>The primary difference is in reproductive behavior. For the Gid, males are typically only interested in sex after a period of romance, with plenty of time spent together in mutual self-disclosure with an abundance of emotional intimacy. Gid females are interested in sex when an attractive person exists within the range of their senses. Or is remembered to have existed. Or implied to potentially exist. Or fantasize about.</p>
  	<p>This inversion of the human norm is primarily due to the Gid's robust immune systems able to handle most sexually transmitted diseases and their females being in full conscious control over their fertility. This has created an immutable foundation of intimacy where males, being the sex incapable of taking control over their reproductive rights, are forced to carefully calculate each partner's suitability for starting a family with. Meanwhile the females can do as they please consequence free.</p>

    	<h4>History</h4>
    	<p>The Gid lost their homeworld in an accident over 3000 years ago. The exact date is lost to time due to the chaos that followed the accident and the Gid's subsequently becoming steller nomads.</p>
  	<p>They've spent centuries traveling the Sector, but not in modern ships. Until 500 years ago, the Gid were restricted to Sub-Light travel, which means their star charts are far less robust than one might think. Despite this, the Gid are responsible for the routing of many of our sector's <a href="Hyperlane99.html">Star Roads</a>. They continue to serve important roles within modern society, primarily as the bulk of explorers, navigators, and surveyors. The Gid are also amongst the best shipwrights in the Galaxy, and form 80% of Saurian Shipyards’ designers and engineers.</p>
  	<p>A significant number of Gid are waiting for humanity to be officially contactable in an attempt to in their words "Form team primate and dunk on losers". A phrase which apparently means they believe they can offer significant assistance to human civilization.</p>

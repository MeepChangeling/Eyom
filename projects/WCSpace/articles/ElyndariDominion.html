        <p>The Elyndari Dominion is a <a href="GalaticPulse.html">pre-Pulse</a> galatic empire which is believed to have ruled over at least a third of the Galixy. Its influence was greater than its own borders by far, with its culture, technology, magic, and religion stretching out to all but the furthest satalites. They used this influence to make all pre-Pulse civilizations known to modern accademia follow their genral ways of life. Notably, their extreem dependnce on intersteller trade to "spread the load" of sapient life across "the natural world".</p>
        <p>As one might expect, this prevented the pre-Pulse species from being self sufishent on any single planet or space habitat. Space Habatats were also far more popular pre-Pulse, with an estimated 70% of people living in space, with an additional 20% living on asteroid and lunar bases.</p>
        <p>The Elyndari Dominion was a sophisticated society known for its religious refusal to combine magic and technology. Galatic Standard technology of the modern era utilises both as required and practical, expressly due to the damage caused by refusing to understand there is no diffrence between magic and science. The formost example being modern shield technology, which would have been able to save the majority of pre-Pulse populations from the Pulse. The Dominion's complex cultural and political structure was not theocratic, but was close enough to a theocrasy to make any real change of foundational policy an impossability.</p>
        <h4>The Fate of the Elyndari</h4>
        <p>With their space-faring capabilities crippled by the Pulse, the interconnected worlds and habatats of the Elyndari were isolated. Starvation, social collapse, and technological regression followed as trade routes disintegrated and isolated communities struggled to adapt.</p>
        <p>Arechologists have found signs of civil wars and other forms of infighting in Elyndari settlments. Howeaver, the vast majority of the time it appears that the Elyndari chose mass suicide rather than take actions to preserve their own lives. Actions such as developing planet side resource extraction industries, or using more primitive agricultural methods than hydroponics. As far as we can tell, their religion had such strict rules against exploiting nature that even picking berries in the forest byond what you needed for imeadiate survival could be a form of sin. It's impossible to know why or to what extent these religious tennants ruled over the Elyndari. We do howeaver know they did, and seriously enough for their practishioners to choose death over "harming" the natural order.</p>
        <p>As far as we know, the Elyndari were driven to extinction by the Pulse. A few species survived, some of whom recall what Elyndari looked like. No species discovered to date has matched any of their descriptions, nor what fragmentary reccords exist. It is possible for some Elyndari communities to have survived in isolated, protected locations, maintaining fragments of their culture and knowledge. Especialy since no culture's grasp is prefect and some dissonants must have existed who would be willing to abandon their faith for survival. Howeaver, after more than 2000 years of searching, the Galixy isn't holding its breath.</p>

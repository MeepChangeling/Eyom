          <p>There are many methods of Faster Than Light (FTL) travel which have been attempted. There are few which work. Of those that work, only one is suitable for general use by the majority of the galaxy's citizens. Before discussing this method, here is a list (in no particular order) of all FTL systems which both work and are in use on occasion :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Slipstream Drive</li>
            <li>Warp Drive</li>
            <li>Phantom Cascade</li>
            <li>Horizon Drive</li>
            <li>Void-Bloom Drive</li>
            <li>Surf Drive</li>
            <li>Class IV+ Gravitic Drives</li>
            <li>Quantum Tunneling</li>
            <li>Jump Drives</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Star Roads</h4>
          <p>All of the above FTL systems are in one way or another inferior to, or superseded by the Galaxy's chosen FTL method, Star Roads. Star Roads are systems of dyson objects which project energy beams across the galaxy. These beams are directed and focused along their length by arches. The beams allow vessels to be "pushed" in a manner similar to an ocean current. Provided a Star Road is built along a route with favorable conditions (Little to no gravitational anomalies, low density of space dust and debris, minimal dimensional flux, ect), an object within the beam can be rapidly accelerated well beyond the speed of light. All without the object needing to expend fuel or even possess a FTL drive onboard.</p>
          <p>The rate of acceleration within a Star Road's beam is directly proportional to the object's mass and surface area. A more massive object accelerates slower, but this effect is mitigated if there is more surface area on which the beam can push. Consequently solar sails are common on larger ships, but most vessels are kept relatively small (Roughly the size of medium trucks and cars, though buss and RV sized ships are common too.) to ensure maximum acceleration and more critical deceleration. The maximum speed achievable on a Star Road is the same regardless of an object's mass.</p>
          <p>Star Roads come in many classes, the most important being Hyperlanes and Star Lanes. A Hyperlane is capable of accelerating ships to at least 600,000 C. Roads with a speed below 600k but above 34k are classified as Star Lanes. Slower Roads are typically referred to as "roads", but there are over six dozen different names depending on what the road is for, its layout, shape, and other factors (The differences are only relevant to civil engineers and technicians). Many Roads cannot accelerate a modern ship past what it can achieve on its own, however, the use of a road still ensures the ship itself does not burn fuel.</p>
          <p>Hyperlanes have become key to the Galaxy's everything. Hyperlanes are connected at Hyperlane Hubs, systems which have a dyson sphere to power arrays of rings, each leading to a different destination. Along a Hyperlane one can find gates which allow access to a lane and departure from a lane despite not being at one of the terminal rings. There are also interchanges where one can move from one lane to another where they cross. Galactic Civilization follows these routes.</p>


          <h5>Pros and Cons at Star Roads</h5>
          <p><b>Pros:</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Stability and Safety</i><br> The highly controlled environment of Star Roads minimizes the risks associated with many other FTL methods, making them the safest option for most travelers.</li>
            <li><i>Predictability</i><br> With Star Roads, travel times and routes are well-known and reliable, which is crucial for logistics, trade, and military planning.</li>
            <li><i>Fuel and Cost Efficiency:</i><br> Ships using Star Roads save on fuel and maintenance costs, making this system the most cost-effective method for long-distance travel.</li>
            <li><i>Infrastructure Benefits</i><br> The established network of Hubs and gates offers numerous logistical support options, including refueling, repairs, and emergency services, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted travel.</li>
            <li><i>Economic Integration</i><br> The Star Road network fosters economic ties between systems, creating a shared infrastructure that promotes interstellar trade and collaboration which would not otherwise develop.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Limited Flexibility</i><br> Star Roads only connect specific locations, limiting flexibility in travel. Ships are restricted to the established routes, making off-road travel or reaching remote destinations difficult without using other FTL methods.</li>
            <li><i>Strategic Vulnerability</i><br> The centralized nature of Star Roads means that control of the Hubs can become a strategic choke point. If a Hub or major lane is compromised or captured, entire regions could be cut off or stranded.</li>
            <li><i>Dependence on Infrastructure</i><br> The reliance on the extensive infrastructure of rings, Hubs, and gates means that any significant damage to these structures can disrupt travel, leading to economic and logistical crises.</li>
            <li><i>Slower Response Times</i><br> While fast, Star Roads may not be as quick as some other FTL methods like the Horizon or Slipstream Drives in terms of emergency response or rapid deployment across unexpected distances.</li>
            <li><i>Initial Setup and Maintenance Costs</i><br> Establishing and maintaining Star Roads requires significant initial investment and ongoing costs, particularly for the Dyson spheres powering the Hubs and the continuous upkeep of the lanes.</li>
          </ol>


          <h5>Why Star Roads?</h5>
          <p>The best answer to why the Galaxy chose Star Roads as the defacto means of travel is best explained by looking at the other working methods of FTL and truly weighing their pros and cons. Or in some cases, merely thinking about what exactly using the drive does. Several functional methods are in a word, distressing.</p>


          <h4>Class IV+ Gravitic Drives</h4>
          <p>All ships, even ancient ones, have a Gravitic Drive: a device which creates or manipulates gravitational fields in order to propel itself. This technology is simple, energy efficient (at smaller scales), and can is the primary drive for any given vehicle in a developed system. However, those systems are always class III or lower Gravitic Drives, which have a top speed of approximately a six tenths the speed of light at best (usually much much much slower for safety reasons).</p>
          <p>To achieve FTL speeds, a ship would require a Class IV or higher Gravitic Drive. They can and do accelerate ships well past the speed of light, with a theoretical maximum of 12.843 C, and an average of 5.89 C.</p>
          <p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Environmentally Adaptive</i><br> Able to use natural gravitational fields to boost FTL travel, making it energy-efficient in regions with many gravitational sources.</li>
            <li><i>Old Technology</i><br> A fully mature technology, with all the benefits to efficiency, miniaturization, ease of manufacture, etc. which come from a technology being old as dirt.</li>
            <li><i>Stealth Capabilities</i><br> The drive can minimize emissions, making the ship harder to detect during travel.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Slow as Balls</i><br> Due to the sheer scale of space, 12.843 C is nothing. That would take a ship from Earth to the next star (Alpha Centauri) in just under 4 months. The more achievable speed would get you there in 8.5 months.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Class IV+ Gravitic Drives are typically used by ships for in-system travel. While interstellar distances are a no-go, traveling from Earth to Jupiter in seven minutes is very practical.</p>


          <h4>Quantum Tunneling</h4>
          <p>Much to the chagrin of those who know what Quantum Tunneling is, QT Drives have nothing to do with quantum tunneling. They do however allow ships to "teleport" "through" solid matter in a manner somewhat similar to quantum particles teleporting short distances.</p>
          <p>Originally developed as a defense system, QT Drives take a ship out of phase with our universe just enough to slip through the gaps between atoms in "in phase" matter. This allows a ship to ignore things like friction, and the laws of inertia. Which means the ship's engines can simply allow the craft to keep accelerating and accelerating until it's broken the light barrier.</p>
          <p>A simple adjustment of the phase shift technology allowed the ship to also be "pulled" in a direction of its choice which is, mostly, steerable. The end result being a FTL drive with a top speed of 29.159 C. Any faster and the ship will vanish from this plane of existence, never to return.</p>


          <p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Bypass Obstacles</i><br> Allows ships to pass through solid objects, like planets or asteroids, by temporarily existing out of phase with conventional matter.</li>
            <li><i>Minimal Spatial Footprint</i><br> The process creates little to no detectable spatial disturbances, making it hard to track.</li>
            <li><i>Cool</i><br> Watching something the size of a small building inexplicably "go" is, objectively, pretty cool.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Short Distances</i><br> Effective only for relatively short distances compared to other FTL methods, often limiting its utility to within a single star system.</li>
            <li><i>High Risk</i><br> Miscalculations can result in catastrophic outcomes, like materializing inside a planet or star.</li>
            <li><i>Specialized Ships</i><br> Requires highly specialized ships, which are expensive to build and maintain.</li>
            <li><i>Disconcerting</i><br> Eerily similar in behavior to a video game's physics engine glitch, QT Drives can make most people quite uncomfortable. (Understanding their operation requires 29 separate high level degrees, making the number of people who understand how they can function at all <i>extremely</i> small.)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Class IV+ Gravitic Drives are typically used by ships for in-system travel. While interstellar distances are a no-go, traveling from Earth to Jupiter in seven minutes is very practical.</p>


          <p>Jump Drives</p>
          <p>Jump Drives are a popular military FTL solution for short range tactical maneuvering. They occasionally appear on civilian vessels, primarily exploration focused craft and heavy freighters which need to regularly make trips into fringe space (Areas close to but not connected to a Star Road.). They function by making a traversable wormhole via a signal beamed through subspace (IE dimensions with a lower frequency than our own). Matter traversable wormholes can only exist for an instant, and so must be formed around the ship itself.</p>
          <p>This takes a large amount of power, extensive and precise calculation (which many modern computers simply cannot do in a timely manner), and of course is all to create a wormhole which is safe for precisely a few milliseconds. Should a ship not correctly form its wormhole it will be torn to pieces in a similar fashion to if it had entered a black hole.</p>
          <p>However, when successful, a Jump Drive allows a ship to instantly transport itself across space (provided one discounts the time spent calculating the jump).</p>


          <p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Point-to-Point Travel</i><br> Allows for direct travel between two points, bypassing obstacles and dangers in between.</li>
            <li><i>Quick Deployment</i><br> Excellent for quick escapes or surprise attacks in military applications. While jump calculations do take time, it's far less than crossing the same space with other drives overall. Provided you only need one jump.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Accuracy Issues</i><br> Without precise calculations, jump drives can result in ships appearing off-course, sometimes in hazardous locations.</li>
            <li><i>Distance Limits</i><br> Jumps are limited to about 45 LY per jump due to the limits of modern computing and the complexity of the mathematics behind jump calculations. Unfortunately, calculations cannot be reused between known points as there are environmental variables to factor.</li>
            <li><i>Cooldown Time</i><br> After a jump, the drive requires a significant cooldown period before it can be used again.
            Jump Fatigue: Repeated jumps can strain the ship's systems and crew, requiring rest and maintenance between uses.</li>
            <li><i>Distance Limits</i><br> Jumps are limited to about 45 LY per jump due to the limits of modern computing and the complexity of the mathematics behind jump calculations. Unfortunately, calculations cannot be reused between known points as there are environmental variables to factor.</li>
            <li><i>Jump Ships are hard</i><br> A very common and much beloved staple of science fiction across many cultures, the idea of one big ship acting as a carrier through a FTL Jump is extremely impractical. A ship's hull geometry, mass, and shape are all parts of the jump calculation. Thus every single ship attached or within the ship increases the complexity of the calculation. This also applies to the crew, but their comparatively low mass and volume makes crew negligible.</li>
          </ol>


          <h4>Void-Bloom Drive</h4>
          <p>The Void-Bloom Drive is named for its striking visual effect upon activation. It can be thought of as a hyperspace drive, and functions much like that concept. However it is not translating the ship into another dimension. Rather it is opening a rift between the bradyoninc (sub-light) and tachyonic (FTL) particle "realms", and translating the ship's particles into their tachyonic equivalents (and vise versa). The name comes from the rift's floral shape, which "blooms" open as the ship enters FTL.</p>
          <p>The operational principle of a Void-Bloom Drive is the light barrier itself. Faster than light particles do exist, but can never travel slower than light. By translating bradyoninc matter into tachyonic matter a ship loses the ability to travel slowly, but can make use of various exotic propulsion systems which only work in the tachyonic realm and allow the ship to travel at extreme speeds before being later translated back to the bradyoninc realm.</p>


          <p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Exceptionally Fast</i><br> Top of the line Void-Bloom Drives can excede the speeds of Hyperlanes by orders of magnitude.</li>
            <li><i>Bypasses Obstacles</i><br> Nothing within the bradyonic realm can prevent a ship from traveling via a Void-Bloom Drive if it is able to activate the drive. The ship will simply pass through any obstacle, natural or artificial, matter or energy.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Navigational Challenges</i><br> The tachyonic realm is a surreal and constantly shifting landscape, making navigation difficult and dangerous without skilled Aethernauts (the term for a navigator trained to work within the tachyonic realm).</li>
            <li><i>Corrosion</i><br> The Aetheric Expanse is a surreal and constantly shifting landscape, making navigation difficult and dangerous without skilled Aethernauts.</li>
            <li><i>Entity Interference</i><br> The tachyonic realm is just as inhabited as our own. Encounters with tachyonic beings can be unpredictable; some may aid travelers, while others might pose existential threats.</li>
            <li><i>Exotic fuels</i><br> Exotic drives functioning on tachyonic physics require exotic fuels found in tachyonic space, or produced in very small quantities in very rare laboratories, using very expensive equipment, run by very hard to train technicians.</li>
          </ol>


          <h4>Warp Drive</h4>
          <p>Warp Drive is perhaps the most common form of FTL in the universe. The concept of bending space itself to effectively accelerate an object pops up in most technological civilizations. It's not even that difficult to do once the underlying engineering principles for warp field projectors are developed. It's also reasonably fast even as a newly emerging technology.</p>
          <p>The thing is it does mean each ship needs to carry its own fuel and winds up being about one third by size engines and fuel tanks. This can work for some species, but it does mean space travel winds up being limited to a small few, mostly merchant vessels and naval craft. A common spacer term for civilizations who prefer warp drives is "sailors" as warp based civilizations resemble ocean faring powers far more than interstellar civilizations.</p>


          <p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Maneuverability</i><br> Ships using warp drives can adjust their course mid-travel, allowing them to avoid obstacles and reroute as necessary.</li>
            <li><i>Independence</i><br> Unlike Hyperlanes, warp drives allow ships to travel anywhere without relying on pre-established routes.</li>
            <li><i>Speed Variability</i><br> The speed can be adjusted depending on the energy input, offering flexibility in travel time.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Energy Intensive</i><br> Warp drives require immense amounts of power,  necessitating a large portion of the ship being dedicated to carrying reactors or advanced fuel sources.</li>
            <li><i>Maintenance</i><br> The precision required of a warp drive's components makes it prone to breakdowns. They require frequent specialized maintenance, often mid-mission. Rolling repairs are commonplace (IE many warp drives need some maintenance performed while they are in use.).</li>
            <li><i>Warp Wakes</i><br> While not permanently damaging, or long lived by any means, warp drives leave a momentary distortion in spacetime after a ship passes. These wakes can disrupt communications if a transmission is intersected by a warp wake. This can cause communications blackouts lasting between 10 minutes and 2 hours.</li>
          </ol>


          <h4>Slipstream Drive</h4>
          <p>The Quantum Slipstream Drive manipulates quantum fields to create a "slipstream" in subspace (a lower-dimensional layer beneath normal space) through which the ship can travel at effectively FTL speeds (The ship never actually moves faster than light). It is not technically a hyperdrive as the ship isn't moved into another dimension, rather the ship makes a normal-space "tunnel" through subspace. It's not a wormhole either, as no singularity is involved. The ship builds a temporary tunnel made from real-space through subspace, travels through the tunnel, then the tunnel is filled in.</p>




          <p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Flexible Travel</i><br> Can be activated almost anywhere (does not work within the sphere of influence of any body capable of spherizing under its own gravity), allowing ships to travel independently of external infrastructure like Hyperlanes.</li>
            <li><i>Short Travel Times</i><br> Ships can cover vast distances quickly by "slipping" between normal space and subspace. In theory, any two points can be crossed within a few minutes.</li>
            <li><i>Lower Energy Requirements</i><br> Compared to more speculative drives like the Alcubierre, the energy requirements are theoretically more manageable.</li>
            <li><i>Ride Alongs</i><br> Multiple ships can travel along the slipstream with a slipstream enabled ship. They must keep prefect pace with the drive ship for safety, but it is possible to safely take a few other vessels through the tunnel.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Subspace Instability</i><br> Slipstream corridors can be unstable, potentially ejecting ships back into normal space with significant velocity or damage. Or more frequently, collapsing before the ship exists, trapping them within an isolated pocket of normal space with no way out.</li>
            <li><i>Gravitational Interference</i><br> Nearby massive objects (like stars or black holes) can distort or collapse slipstream corridors, making navigation near such objects risky.</li>
            <li><i>Precise Calibration Needed</i><br> The drive requires precise calibration to maintain a stable slipstream, with small errors potentially leading to catastrophic failure.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Slipstream drive systems are found mostly on ships built by the <a href="grays.html">Grays</a> as they invented the drive system. It has spread across the galaxy through various underworld connections and is used in place of jump drives by some militaries as it allows a carrier to arrive with its fighters and interceptors already deployed.</p>
          <p>However, the instability of slipstream tunnels makes the drive overall a risky pick, and since it is impossible to emerge from FTL within 0.78 AU of even a smaller main sequence star like Sol (due to the gravitational interference of the star), a slipstream  most of a system's strategic assets are not within immediate jump range. This limits the military use of the drive to less developed groups with assets mostly located in the far reaches of solar systems or on specific planets. Which is fairly few overall due to stars being essentially giant balls of free energy.</p>


          <h4>Phantom Cascade</h4>
          <p>A Phantom Cascade Device (better known as PCD) is a psudo-FTL method that allows ships to cross across vast distances by entangling probability spaces then collapsing the wave function into a desired state, thereby relocating the ship to a destination it could conceivably have reached without actually traveling. If you don't understand what that means, the ship teleports itself to a location it is possible for it to be. Some people claim the device works by swapping positions with a parallel univerce's version of the ship where it happens to be where you want to go already, but this is not the case.</p>
          <p>For the technically inclined, this drive system is not tech based. It makes use of several laws of extra dimensional physics to accomplish feats which are not possible within the scope of our universe's physics. A process we call Flux Engineering (short for dimensional flux engineering) and most primitive cultures would call magic. While almost all modern technology uses some Flux Engineering to operate (Often to decrease energy costs by several orders of magnitude), the Phantom Cascade Device is almost entirely based in Flux Mechanics instead of Physical Mechanics.</p>
          <p>The same technology has been used on occasion to replace some manufacturing and mining steps within logistics chains. However it's simply not very economically viable to use the technology for stationary objects. The energy cost of the cascade scales with the improbability of the desired outcome. As a lump of ore is never going to melt into a purified ingot on its own, the cost is exceptionally high. But since a vehicle can travel easily enough, the cost to relocate one is much lower... But remains proportional to the distance one desires to relocate the vehicle.</p>
          <p>The name Phantom Cascade comes from the visual effect of a ship using the device departing or arriving. It shimmers into existence like a phantom, the result of the cascade of probability spaces collapsing to achieve the new result.</p>


          <p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Cascade Recovery</i><br> If the ship has been damaged or destroyed relatively recently, and its PCD is still operational, its possible to "revert" the ship's "state" to one before it was damaged / destroyed.</li>
            <li><i>Instant Travel</i><br> PCDs are effectively teleportation. The travel time is instant.</li>
            <li><i>Tactical Uses</i><br> PCDs can be used to move a ship a short distance (as in a few kilometers) for next to no energy cost. Short jumps within the pilot’s line of sight do not require a navigator’s assistance to perform, and thus, no calculations are needed. While the ship will still be bulky due to the drive’s sheer size, this means the ship can rapidly and repeatedly “jink” (technical term for dodging via PCD) incoming fire or hazards.</li>            
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Extreme Energy Requirements</i><br> PCDs require massive capacitor banks, creating a similar problem to Warp Drives in that about a third of the ship has to be dedicated to energy production and storage.</li>
            <li><i>Navigator Needed</i><br> While not as computationally intensive as Jump Drive calculations, it still takes a good deal of math to correctly target and plot a Cascade. It can take up to 30 minutes to perform the calculations, preventing the drive from being a viable means of FTL in the case of an emergency. These calculations cannot be performed by a machine due to the nature of a PCD. An organic mind trained in the use of the device and able to perform journeyman flux manipulations is necessary to operate it.</li>
            <li><i>Sensor Network Required</i><br> The ship's navigator will need as close to live data relating to your destination as possible. As with all teleportation, it is possible to appear inside a solid object, or in a location where a collision is unavoidable. This limits travel distance by comms and sensor range, unless one wants to take a risk.</li>
            <li><i>Resonance Cascades</i><br> The most likely outcome of a PCD malfunctioning is an event where waves of energy are combined (resonate) in a continuous loop (cascade). The inevitable result being the ship detonates, forming a short lived white hole. This is incredibly dangerous for anything near the ship, leading to serious restrictions and policies on when and where PCDs can be activated. Many stations will fire on ships with a PCD if they even appear to be about to engage their drive near the station.</li>
            <li><i>Nearly Pure Flux Mechanics</i><br> Most people avoid using Flux on its own in any serious fashion. This is a safety precaution. Just like physics, flux has its limits and laws. Unlike physics, flux's laws can often be violated. This is a bad thing. You never benefit from breaking one of those laws, it will explode in your face. As a result, few people choose to pursue Flux Mechanics far enough to maintain, let alone develop a device as complex as a PCD. Consequently, the device is extremely difficult to maintain as those with the necessary knowledge are rare.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>PCD devices are extremely rare, but quite effective for the few who can afford them and keep them in working order. The most famous ship with a working PCD is the aptly named Vanishing Act, a light freighter operating within Quiet Space under the illustrious Captain Raz Ta’gi. Its fame comes from Captain Ta’gi’s dedication to mastering PCDs personally, and ability to maintain the drive and navigate solo. A Galactic first.</p>

          <h4>Surf Drive</h4>
          <p>The Surf Drive is a solar sail adjacent technology which captures tachyons, slowing them down while accelerating the ship. It's a somewhat crude system of FTL travel, but notable for proving that FTL within normal space is possible, and by having a built in system for countering time dilation. As it happens, when an object is moving faster than light without any engineered means of chrono stabilization time dilation reverses once light speed is reached. Careful acceleration and deceleration timings can entirely eliminate the effects of time dilation.</p>
          <p>Yes this does make the Surf Drive a time machine. But it isn't a very good one. Time has a "handedness" to it (it only likes to go one way). While the Surf Drive can effectively travel backwards in time, it can never do so beyond the point its journey began plus the duration of its travel time. As an example, if the ship started traveling at noon on October 3rd, 2001 and made a six hour trip from the perspective of those aboard, there is no way for the ship to spin the clock backwards enough to arrive at its destination before noon on October 3rd, 2001.</p>
          <p>A careful reading of the above should inform you that this time travel is only from outside observers. A Surf Drive ship will seem to depart and arrive within hours, minutes, or occasionally instantly for people at either end of its destination, but for those abord the ship, hours, days, or years could have passed. To expand on the previous example, while the ship left port on noon of October 3rd, 2001 and arrived at the exact same time, the entire crew experienced a three and half hour long voyage in time the rest of the universe simply cannot perceive. An interesting role reversal of the time dilation effect on spacers in the days before chrono stabilizers, to say the least.</p>
          <p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Total Freedom</i><br> A surf drive can take a ship anywhere at all that ship wants to go.</li>
            <li><i>Outwardly Instant Travel</i><br> The ship can, if its acceleration and deceleration are perfectly timed, arrive as soon as it engages its drive. If the ship is automated, this can make for extremely quick logistical systems. </li>
            <li><i>Low Energy Requirements</i><br> The surf drive's tachyon sails take little energy to operate. There are stories of captains using heavy weapon power cells to get their ships to the nearest port for a refuel in a pinch.</li>
            <li><i>Primitive Yet Functional</i><br> A Surf Drive can be built using materials most civilizations invent during their early pre-starfarring years. It is the most common form of first FTL drive in the Galaxy for this reason.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Time Dilation is a Bastard</i><br> Its possible for a long route that is traveled regularly (once a day or so from the outside perspective) to age the crew to death within a couple years of regular operation. This can be okay if the ship's crew is large enough for stable mental health and regular socialization opportunities over a lifetime. Most ships are not that large.</li>
            <li><i>Acceleration Time</i><br> From the crew's perspective, it can take days or even weeks to reach FTL. The speed of acceleration depends on the ship's size, mass, shape, configuration, sail type, and so on. There is no way to significantly shorten the time it takes a ship to accelerate once it is manufactured, and the best acceleration time is seven earth hours. Further acceleration is needed to reach the vessel's cruising speed, and just as much acceleration is needed to stop at the other end. While Surf Drive can reach a top speed of nearly 120k C, the average is 74k C and is usually reached within four days.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Surf Drive is best for automated craft, like delivery drones, which need to operate away from a Star Road. Its acceleration time makes it almost pointless for short trips (in terms of distance), and is effectively a cost in terms of organic's lifetime. Some people do not mind spending their entire life on a ship, but few people want that life to last a mere two galactic standard years.</p>


          <h4>Horizon Drive</h4>
          <p>The Horizon Drive is a device that harnesses the power of black holes to sling ships through the event horizons without being crushed. This works by using the energy of the black hole to create a stable traversable wormhole and a protective energy bubble which keeps the ship from being torn apart by tidal forces for the brief instant it is within the black hole.</p>
          <p>This technology is the ancestor of the Jump Drive, which is in essence an Eclipse Drive with a singularity generator. This is what limits the Jump Drive's distance per hop. A natural black hole could theoretically allow for a jump between galaxies (assuming it was supermassive, rotating, and another similar singularity could be found in another galaxy within 6.1 million LY).</p>
          <p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Extreme Speeds</i><br> The gravitational pull of black holes accelerates ships to unimaginable speeds, allowing them to traverse the galaxy in days.</li>
            <li><i>Energy Abundance</i><br> The proximity to black holes allows ships to tap into vast amounts of energy, effectively making travel free and allowing them to top up on power reserves.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Cons:</b> </p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Extreme Precision Required</i><br> Miscalculating the entry or exit point can result in catastrophic failure, as ship will then be within an actual black hole without its protective bubble.</li>
            <li><i>High Maintenance</i><br> The Horizon Drive requires frequent recalibration and maintenance, especially after each use, to avoid catastrophic misalignment which would result in the unprotected ship being pushed into the black hole.</li>
            <li><i>Black Hole Scarcity</i><br> The Horizon Drive must use a black hole as the point of entry for FTL, and the point of exist for FTL. A secondary drive is needed if one wishes to travel to systems which do not have black holes.</li>
            <li><i><b><u>You Need to Enter a Black Hole!</u></b></i><br> It works by flying into a black <i>fucking</i> hole. Even people who trust the drive system entirely feel a little nervous on each jump. Most people rightfully think of a singularity as nature's garbage disposal and its accretion disk as the cosmic sink in which that trash blender has been installed. Because that is exactly what they are. This drive requires you fly through one while avoiding all of the blades.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>You can only go from black hole to black hole, and you have to fly into a black hole to do it. Is it any wonder this method is mostly used for comm buoys and probes?</p>

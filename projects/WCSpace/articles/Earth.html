      	<figcaption>The Planet Earth</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Earth <i>(aka Sol III)</i> is a typical <a href="PlanetaryClassification.html">T3-A1-G3-H5-S2 planet</a> located at the southern central edge of <a href="QuietSpace.html">Quiet Space</a>. Due to deals with various human governments, we are not able to discuss or disclose much of the interesting elements of Earth in places which are human accessible. We are allowed to mention that Earth is a <a href="ShrineWorld.html">Class IX Shrine World</a>, with a resident population of <a href="extradimentionalentities.html">extradimentional entities</a> of Class III or higher numbering in the low tens of thousands. They have had a large impact on human life and history.</p>
    	<p>Earth is interesting to many species for many reasons. <a href="jirrins.html">Jirrins</a> reaction to Earth's atmosphere makes Earth a longed for tourist destination. The <a href="dellins.html">Dellins</a> long for access to Earth cuisine, which is exceptionally varied and robust thanks to Earth's wide abundance of plants. Most of which have been selectively bread for deliciousness by humans.</p>
    	<p>The <a href="grays.html">Grays</a> and <a href="Gid.html">Gid</a> find Earth to be pleasant in terms of climate, many seeking to immigrate if/when humans allow it. <a href="axxani.heml">Axxani</a> has a special love of human media, and doubtlessly has thousands if not millions of pre-existing online friends she would like to send a drone to visit.</p>
    	<p>There is much more about Earth which makes it special. Unfortunately, as previously mentioned, we are not allowed to discuss them here. Technical information about Earth as a planet follows.</p>
    	<h4>Technical Details</h4>
    	<p>Earth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium, with an average diameter of <span class="toggle-item">twelve thousand seven hundred and forty two kilometers (seven thousand nine hundred and eighteen miles)</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">12,742 kilometers (7,918 mi)</span>, making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Sol System. Most of Earth's surface is ocean water: <span class="toggle-item">seventy point eight percent or three hundred and sixty one million square kilometers (one hundred and thirty nine million square miles)</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">70.8% or 361 million km2 (139 million sq mi)</span>. This vast pool of salty water is often called the world ocean, and makes Earth a water world. In Earth's early history the ocean may have covered Earth completely. The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest.</p>
    	<p>Earth's mass is approximately <span class="toggle-item">five point nine seven to the one thousandth and twentyfourth's power kiligrams or five point nine seven Yottagrams</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">5.97×1024 kg (5.970 Yg)</span>. It is composed mostly of iron (<span class="toggle-item">thirty two point one percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">32.1% </span>by mass), oxygen (<span class="toggle-item">thirty point one percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">30.1%</span>), silicon (<span class="toggle-item">fifteen point one percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">15.1%</span>), magnesium (<span class="toggle-item">thirteen point nine percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">13.9%</span>), sulfur (<span class="toggle-item">two point nine percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">2.9%</span>), nickel (<span class="toggle-item">one point eight percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">1.8%</span>), calcium (<span class="toggle-item">one point five percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">1.5%</span>), and aluminium (<span class="toggle-item">one point four percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">1.4%</span>), with the remaining <span class="toggle-item">one point two percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">1.2%</span> consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to gravitational separation, the core is primarily composed of the denser elements: iron (<span class="toggle-item">eighty eight point eight percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">88.8%</span>), with smaller amounts of nickel, sulfur, and less than <span class="toggle-item">one percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">1%</span> trace elements. The most common rock constituents of the crust are oxides. Over <span class="toggle-item">ninty nine percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">99%</span> of the crust is composed of various oxides of eleven elements, principally oxides containing silicon (the silicate minerals), aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium.</p>
    	<p>The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-<span class="toggle-item">fourty</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">40</span>, uranium-<span class="toggle-item">twothirty eight</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">238</span>, and thorium-<span class="toggle-item">two three two</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">232</span>. At the center, the temperature may be up to <span class="toggle-item">six thousand degreese centigrade (ten thousand eight hundred and thirty degreese ferignheight)</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">6,000 °C (10,830 °F)</span>, and the pressure could reach <span class="toggle-item">three hundred and xisty gigapascals (fifty two million pounds per square inch)</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">360 GPa (52 million psi)</span>. Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately <span class="toggle-item">nine point eight meters per second squared (thirty two feet per second squared)</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2)</span>. Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth's gravitational field.</p>
    	<p>Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is <span class="toggle-item">three point zero five times ten to the minus five power teslas</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">3.05×10−5 T</span>, with a magnetic dipole moment of <span class="toggle-item">seven point seven nine times ten to the twenty second power Am two at epoch twothousand</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">7.79×10<sup>22</sup> Am2 at epoch 2000</span>, decreasing nearly <span class="toggle-item">six percent</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">6%</span> per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average). The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately <span class="toggle-item">seven hundred thousand</span><span class="toggle-item" style="display:none;">700,000</span> years ago.</p>

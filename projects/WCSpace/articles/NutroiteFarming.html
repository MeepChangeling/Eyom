        <p>Nutroite is a family of crystals with a quasi-unstable crystaline structure that can be made to undergo fusion when exposed to concentrated gamma radiation with a specific frequency (exact frequency depends on the varriety of nutroite). These highly sought-after crystals have revolutionized power generation across the galaxy due to their shelf-stable nature, high power density, and remarkably low radiation output while undergoig fusion. While they are not the only poser source in widespread use, Nutroite reactors can be found in many homes, ships, installations, vehicals, and tools across the Galixy.</p>
        <p>The first varriety of nutroite crystal to be discovered was kemkōsite <i>(lit. Deep lava stone)</i>. It was discovered by the geologist Sosroun Mīph within ancient lava tubes on the planet Jir (the Jirrin homeworld). He determined the crystal would undergo fusion if its quasi-stable state was disrupted with precision, though was unable to discover the means of disruption. The renound physasist Doctor Koyl discovere the gamma procedure 30 years after his death, leading to the rapid development of the Jirrin energy sector which persists to this day. Other varrieties of nutroite have been discovered and synthasized over the last 400 years, leading to the modern energy industry and its many crystal farms.</p>
        <h4>The Science Behind Nutroite</h4>
        <p>Nutroite's quasi-instability allows it to undergo controlled atomic fusion, converting almost its entire mass into energy. When exposed to a gamma ray laser at a precise wavelength, nutroite initiates a fusion process that releases energy with an efficiency rate of up to 92.492% (for the most pure varrieites. Common nutroite yields up to 67% of its mass as energy over its combustion time.). This "burn" can be rate controlled by adjusting the wattage of the laser array, allowing for the creation of a lot of power quickly, or a little power for a long time. Most nutroite reactors are able to adjust burn rate on the fly.</p>
        <p>A nutroite crystal looses mass as it burns. Unlike most fules (especialy fusion fules) the overall volume of the crystal dosn't decreace. Rather the crystal becomes a fine latticework, simmilar to a block of swiss cheese, almost as if its consumption leaves behind a skeleton. Once a crystla has been fully consumed, the fragile remains must be removed from the reactor before a new crystal can be loaded. This proces sis typicaly automated by using sonic pulses to powderize the crystal remains into seed crystals with which to grow more nutroite, then flushing them from the reactor chamber.</p>
        <h4>Safty Concerns</h4>
        <p>nutroite is unique in that it is a largly safe fule. It's innert without exposure to a concentrated beam of a specfic form of gamma radiation. It dosen't produce large ammounts of inoxing radiation (compared to other fusion fules) when combusting, allowing for nutroite reactors to be relativly small as they do not need much shielding. More intrestingly, it is very difficult to turn into a bomb.</p>
        <p>While nutroite can be, and is, used as a power source for plenty of weapons, directly using it as a nuclear explosive is impossible. This is due to the crystal's fastest fusion rate being significently less than the nessisary rate for a fusion detonation. Nutroite reactors designed for systems requiring bursts of high energy make use of capastor banks to provide the energy. Using a nutroite reactor as a smaller scale bomb is possible, but less effective and far more difficult than accuiring high explosives.</p>
        <p>The same lowish rate of fusion also ensures a meltdown of the reactor is easily cleaned up with little to no long term environmental impacts.</p>
        <h4>Applications of Nutroite</h4>
        <p>Nutroite's ability to convert nearly all its mass into energy makes it an invaluable resource for various applications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Power Generation:</i> Nutroite is the primary fuel for pyroelectric fusion reactors, providing vast amounts of energy for planets, space stations, and starships.</li>
          <li><i>Advanced Propulsion Systems:</i> The high energy output of nutroite makes it ideal for powering advanced spacecraft propulsion systems, enabling faster and more efficient interstellar travel. It is possible to use the reaction to directly generate thrust by  directing the resulting energy into a liniar pathway.</li>
          <li><i>Research and Development:</i> Scientists continue to explore new uses for nutroite, including medical technologies and experimental physics applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Farming nutroite</h4>
        <p>The cultivation of nutroite represents a pinnacle of technological achievement, offering a virtually inexhaustible source of clean energy. The Jirrins' discovery and development of this crystal have had profound implications for the galaxy, paving the way for unprecedented advancements in power generation and beyond. By following the detailed farming process, it is possible to grow nutroite crystals and contribute to this revolutionary energy solution. Below is a detailed guide on how to farm nutroite.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Step 1: Seed Crystal Selection</b></li>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <li><i>Seed Crystals:</i> Begin with high-quality nutroite seed crystals. These can be sourced from existing deposits or grown from fragments of mature crystals.</li>
            <li><i>Purity:</i> Ensure the seed crystals are free from impurities, as these can disrupt the growth process and reduce energy efficiency.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Step 2: Growth Medium Preparation</b></li>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <li><i>Colloidal Iridium Bath:</i> Prepare an Colloidal Iridium solution (1 part Colloidal Iridium, 3 parts sodium sulphide, 5 parts water) and wash your seed crystals and a heated pressure pot with the solution. Ensure the seeds and pot are sterile before continuing. There mus tbe sufishent solution to fill the pot.</li>
            <li><i>Controlled Environment:</i> Maintain a stable environment with temperatures ranging between 500 to 700 degrees Kelvin and pressure conditions at 1.5 gigapascals. This replicates the natural conditions where nutroite forms.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Step 3: Crystal Cultivation</b></li>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <li><i>Electrostatic Field Application:</i> Apply a precisely calibrated electrostatic field to the Colloidal Iridium Bath, enough to begin the seperation of hydrogen and oxygen at the slowest possible rate. This encourages the alignment of atomic structures within the seed crystals, and creates the chemical reactions nessisary to create the compounds needed for the crystal's growth. Nutroite can be grown without this current but will take decades to form and requies additional chemical reagents.</li>
            <li><i>Energy Infusion:</i> Periodically infuse the bath with gamma radiation at a low intensity. This stimulates the quasi-unstable properties of nutroite, aiding in the formation of high-energy bonds.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Step 4: Monitoring and Adjustment</b></li>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <li><i>Regular Monitoring:</i> Continuously monitor the growth process using advanced spectroscopic and holographic imaging techniques. This allows for real-time adjustments to environmental conditions and energy input. Balancing the crystal's growth rate with the development of its quazi stability is crucial to avoid a sudden and catastropic increace in local entropy (IE explosion).</li>
            <li><i>Crystal Stabilization:</i> As the crystals grow, gradually decrease the intensity of the electrostatic field and gamma radiation untill both reach zero and the crystal stops growing. Allow the crystal to rest in the bath in this state for at least 4 months. This stabilizes the crystalline structure, preparing it for harvesting.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Step 5: Harvesting and Processing</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><i>Harvesting:</i> Once the nutroite crystals reach maturity, carefully extract them from the pot. Use non-conductive tools to avoid any unintended energy discharge.</li>
            <li><i>Processing:</i> Clean and polish the harvested crystals to remove any residual impurities. This step is crucial to ensure maximum efficiency during pyroelectric fusion.</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>

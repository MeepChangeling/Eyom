        <p>The Galactic Pulse was a an immense storm of cosmic radiation originating from the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. Its orgins date back aproximently 5 million years, and is the cause of the "Fermi Bubbles" still visible today. The Pulse was named by the civilizations it eradicated, and the name is kept out of respect for the decieced. Howeaver, the name implies the event was over and done with in an instant. This is unture as the Pulse lasted for aproximently a million years.</p>
        <p>The Pulse was the result of a (hopeuly "one off") "eruption" of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Galixy. The exact cause and nature of the event is unknown due to the damage wrought by the event itself. What is known is a significent portion of the black hole's accretion disk converted to energy in a rapid chain reaction, Uutimantly releasing an unprecedented burst of gamma radiation in the form of a massive jet, and a spherical radiation "belt". The belt's formation is the Pulse.</p>
        <p>Before the discovery of hyperspace, it was believed the Pulse was somehow superluminal, with a velosity of ~10.4 C. Howeaver, recent discoveries have shown the Pulse's sheer energy level shifted the bulk of it's mass-energy into hyperspace, with the radiation experianced in normal space having been the bleedthrough rather than the bulk. Combined with a small-scale replication of the Pulse when a prototype black-hole reactor malfunctiotioned (proving the Pulse can occure under certain natural conditions which do infact occure within the Core), the previously wiedly held belief that the Pulse was a weapon has waned greatly. It's now generaly accepted by Accademia to have been a natural disaster. Albiet one on an unpressidented scale.</p>
        <p>The Pulse reached at lest 1500 LY beyond the galaxy's disk. The outtermost known effectted area is an ancient space station seemingly designed to study intergalatic space which is located about 19 LY into the cosmic void. Measurments of the radiation intinsity at diffrent points indicate the Pulse lost energy following the Square Cube law, with less overall energy being preasent the further one was from the Core. Howeaver, it's radiation levels were still leathal at the furthest confirmed affected locations. The rate of decay should have prevented the Pulse from reaching neighboring galixies.</p>
        <p>Naturaly, such intense ratiation is overwhelming. Shield technology of the time could not protect people from radiation of this energy level for more than a few moments (Modern shields can, theroticaly, endure the Pulse for up to 8 hours. Piriod shield systems colapse within seconds.). The intence energy fried shield systems across the galixy, resulting in the imeadiate death of everyone in space.</p>
        <p>FTL communication of the time was not fast enough to outrace the Pulse. Thus the only way to warn people of the cataclysm was to have a ship from an effected area fly faster than the Pulse to warn those not yet affected. The sheer strength of the radiation and quality of shields in question made this, simply put, impossible. A tiny number of civilizations were able to give a 15 minute warning, allowing some of their population to seek shelter.</p>
        <p>Shelter could be found on planets with a type IXd magnetic field (Such as Earth.). This alone was insufishent protection. Planets that provided adiquite shelter also had an atmosphere with a scale height at least 7.89 kilometers and orbited a star with an active heliosphere and solar winds of at least 384 km/s. These factors combined created effective shielding against the Pulse, and provided safe havens for what few refugees there were. Unfortuantly pre-Pulse civilizations were hypderdependent on galatic trade for survival. Starvation, violence, and technological regression ensued.</p>
        <p>This extreme dependency was due to the galatic empire of the pre-Pulse world, the <a href="ElyndariDominion.html">Elyndari Dominion</a>. A highly religious and naturalisticly driven Empire which had used its influence to push its religious views on most if not all of their contemporaries. The Empire's faith had them reside almost entilry within space and eschue exploiting nature as much as possible. Not meerly practical, but possible. Their influence led to most civilizations being as space-based as them, though usualy not as nature-worshiping. In otherwords, most people were in space when the Pulse hit.</p>
        <p>The Pulse's effects on normal space abaited between 3.5 million and 890 thousand years ago, depending on one's distance from the Core. Hyperspace remained irradiated havily untill 2,500 years ago, effectivly preventing all FTL untill the dawn of the modern era.</p>
        <p>The result of the Pulse is the modern galixy. The older species were either purged or had to start over in remote pockets of the universe. All space infrasturcture was lost or destroyed. All modern species are able to interact with one another in person to some degree due to the conditions nessisary for a planet's population to survive the Pulse making them all within the habitability range for one another (atmosphere composisions not withstanding).</p>

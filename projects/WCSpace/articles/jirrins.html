    	<h4>Appearance</h4>
    	<p>Jirrins are best described as "near-humans". The main diffrences are the ears, tails, feet, eyes, and the Jirrin's comparativly limited color palate. The resemblence is otherwise so uncanny that Jirrin scientists have been attempting to find any link between their species and humans since 1953. So far the program has shown that despite the many diffrences in inturnal anatomy, humans and Jirrins can crossbreed. Albiet, the hybrids are steril.</p>
      <p>A Jirrin appears to be a human with a darker "tropical" skintone, entirly black eyes (including the whites), black hair, a thick bushy prehencile tail covered in "orangish" fur (much like a squirrel's, though with the dextarity of a monkey's.), small pointed animal like ears atop their heads, and clawed digitigrade paws.</p>
      <p>They are an aborial species by nature, bending and moving more like a monkey than a human. While they can and do walk upright, they're more comfortable moving verticaly or hanging from cielings than they are on their paws. It's often said that a Jirrin can climb anything, which isn't true as they strugle with many diffrent surfice finishes. Howeaver, since their climbing ability isn't related to their claws but rather works in the same fashion as many lizards, they can climb most surfices.</p>
      <p>Jirrin's eyes are notably entirly black. This isn't a case of their pupils being preportionaly large, they are roughly the same size as a human's. Rather their eyes are pigmented black, with their irus being a slightly lighter shade of black. This coloration appears to be nessisary for the Jirrin's ability to see energy currents, as altering the pigment greatly diiminishes or removes this ability.</p>

    	<h4>Environs Typically Inhabited</h4>
    	<p>Jirrins are a highly adapted species. They belong in forest environments which do not exist on most planets. Their homeowrld, Jir (known to humanity as Kepler-422b), is a volcanic forest planet, one of the rare types of single biome planets. They are uniquly suited to the massive intrelocking tree canopies of their homeworld. This has made their attempts at colonization slow and difficult. Jirrins have to plant forests decades or centuries ahead of colonization attempts unless they plan on building complex and expensive urban centers which replciate their natural environments in steel and polymer.</p>
      <p>Their climbing ability makes getting about space stations much easier for them than most other species. While anyone can walk through a station while the gravplating is functional, Jirrins can simply cling to the walls, floor, or cieling in microgravity, Effectivly ignoring being weightless. This advantage has led to Jirrins embracing space habatats, since even if power is lost to a station, they can move almost unhindered.</p>

      <h4>Abilities</h4>
    	<p>Jirrins are notable for two extrordinary powers unique to their species. First and formost, Jirrins can visualy detect the flow of electrical and trans-dimentional energy. With training this allows them to act as if they had a multimeter at all times, for electrical energy, and as if they had a psykana lens at all times for pyschic powers.</p>
      <p>Their electrical visualization has made Jirrins some of the best electrishions and energy producers in the Galixy. This is largly secondary to their ability to analise an area for psychic workings and phenomina by observing the flow of and traces of trans-dimentional "Flux" as they call it. A Jirrin can tell if somone or something is using paranormal abilities, how strong the ability is, and if trained, what those ability are. All just by seeing the ability being used.</p>
      <p>As nearly all modern technology uses psykana in at least one aspect, this has allowed Jirrins to become expert engineers and mechanics, but also excelent security officers and solgiers as they can remotly analise weapons and devices without advanced equipment. Again, provided they have the right training.</p>

    	<h4>Life Cycle</h4>
    	<p>Jirrins are mammels, and reproduce in the conventional mammellian manner. They give live birth and raise their young for a decade and a half (Their age of adulthood is 15.) in a manner humans would see as "like us, just a bit faster".</p>
      <p>The intresting parts of the Jirrin life cycle are only indirectly related to reproduction. First, Jirrins, like some amphibians, have the ability to change their sex at will. This process takes only two weeks, the speed due to each individual posessings both sets of reproductive organs. One in a fully developed state, the other in a "vegestial" state. If desired, a Jirrin can switch their "active" organs. Secondary sex cahracteristics will change as well, though take longer (9 months to a year) and some features (like height and skeletal shape) do not change.</p>
      <p>This ability is used frequently, with Jirrin communities subconciously adusting to keep their ratio of males to females arround 1.3 males per female. Some individuals refuse to change. These people are seen as odd, strange, or even mentaly ill in the least progressive communities.</p>
      <p>The second intresting quirk of the Jirrin lifecycle is their reaction to CO2. Jir has a volcanic cycle such that a heavily volcanic year comes in a regular cycle, simmilar to Earth's El Ninio cycle. This cycle spikes Jir's CO2 levels for a full year, and Jirrins evolved to register high CO2 levels to mean repopulation is required. Additionaly, Jirrins become less adventerious and more relaxed due this same evolutionary trait. In essence, a spike in CO2 levels makes Jirrins less risk prone and feel the need to reproduce so as to not fall into the lava below, and replenish losses.</p>

    	<h4>History</h4>
    	<p>Jirrins are an old race. Evidence of their civilization can be found on many planets in Quiet Space dating back as far as 8,000 years. Howeaver their current civilization is far smaller than their heights due to an empire-wide outbreak of the pephtōnchōu plague. The death toll was so great a near-total colapse of infrastructure occured, panicking citizens fled dying worlds, uninentionaly taking the plague with them and spreading it across the whole of the empire.</p>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible3">Pephtōnchōu</button>
    	<div class="content">
       	<p>Pephtōnchōu (Eng. the Creeping Rot) is an exceptionaly deadly plague which can effect Jirrins, Humans, and Kinra. It is simmilar to the Black Death of Earth but with an incubation time of nearly 2 years. Durring incubation the bacterum responcible for the plague is exceptionaly ahrd to detect, feeding on and multiplying in the victem's fat cells. Once the bacteria colony has built up a critical mass, it progresses into the rest of its host, causing its many symptoms, followed by a painfull death for 98.37% of its victems. 87.48% of survivors are left paralized to some degree.</p>
        <p>Pephtōnchōu is transmissiable in it sincubation phase. The transmission rate is low and requires some level of regurlarly daily contact with an infected individual. This allows it to quickly spread to family members, coworkers, and neighbors. The long incubation time allows for it to become a pandemic.</p>
        <p>Thanks to pre-public contact with Earth governments, a treatment for Pephtōnchōu has been found. So long as it is identified while in the incubation phase, or the first two stages the treatment (a specialy designed antibiotic based on a Human anti-biotic base Jirrins had not discovered) is 98.97% effective. The plague cannot be treated in stage 3, though modern medicine can restore the pacient if they survive.</p>

        <ol>
        <p>From onset to death, pephtōnchōu typicaly takes its victems in 2 years, 3 months, and 4 days. The first stage of the active infection is the longest (Usualy lasting nearly 3 motnhs.) but can be easily mistaken for other less lethal conditions. As a result, Jirrins get bloodwork done every time they feel ill. This precaushion has stopped several modern pandemics.</p>
        <p>The plague's orgins are unknown. It may be an old bioweapon, or a natural pathogen. What is known is the modern transmission vector is a rare form of rodent, the hōuch, native to the planet Hylra and occasionaly found on freighters transporting fabrics or grain. Hōuch carry the bacteria within glands near their eyes. If threatened they will spray jets of blood to distract their attacker and escape. They have been known to eat the corpese of creatures which die from pephtōnchōu.</p>
        <p>A vaccine for pephtōnchōu has recently been developed and is currently in test trials. The risk of catching the plague in the modern era is extreemly low due to the Jirrin's constant vigilance.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The primary effect of the plague on Jirrin scociety was a retrete to the homeworld (Jir), leading to a quarintine of the planet, overpopulation issues, then underpopulation issues after the plague had swept Jir. The extreme lack of manpower resulted in a major loss of infrastructure, and yet more death from food shortages, sanitation issues, and other scocial colapse symptoms.</p>
      <p>Fortunantly for Jirrins everywhere, their advanced knolage was not lost in full. Monastic orders arrose to keep knoalge safe and after two centuries of hardship Jir began to finaly repopulate and rebuild. Despite this, Jirrin cuture remembered the plague and its source. Space FLight was forbidden for centuries to come, with Jirrins only returning to space 830 years ago when the Bureaucracy came to the sector to begin developing it.</p>
      <p>The current Jirrin Empire was extreemly successful durring Quiet Space's hayday. Unfortuantly, as it was vastly wealthy it was able to import most of what it needed to do buisness and support its citizens. As a result, the colapse of the tourism industry sent the Empire into a death spiral. One narrowly avoided by developing the energy sector and focusing on the export of <a href="NutroiteFarming.html">nutroite crystals</a>.</p>
      <p>While the empire as a whole was preserved through the economic shift, times have been tough with many colonies forced to fend for themselves for the majority of their needs. This has led to what the Jirrins call the Colony Collapse Cataclysm (aka C3). C3 is not usualy attributed to the Jirrin Empire, but rather the Bureaucracy. It primarily effects the outtermost Jirrin colony worlds, and the most rural worlds.</p>
      <p>The Empire has created the Colony Collapse Countermeasures Program to counter as much of the effects as possible. The program is primarily a means of spreading out aid as much as possible, but also includes ensuring outlaying worlds have enough population not only through programs to make raising a family easier, but also by reducing recruitng for the Star Patrol and other millitary gropus via exparimental cloning programs.</p>

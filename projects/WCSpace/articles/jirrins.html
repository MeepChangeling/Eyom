When a human says "Because you're my neighbor." as their reason for kidness, most of you become suspishious. Please remember we're not humans. We're wired to care for others more than ourselves. You're our neighbors, and so we'll help you. Yes, we do expect you to help us too, but it's not transactional. Just good manners."</p>

      <h4>Abilities</h4>
    	<p>Jirrins are notable for two extrordinary powers unique to their species. First and formost, Jirrins can visualy detect the flow of electrical and trans-dimentional energy. With training this allows them to act as if they had a multimeter at all times, for electrical energy, and as if they had a psykana lens at all times for pyschic powers.</p>
      <p>Their electrical visualization has made Jirrins some of the best electrishions and energy producers in the Galixy. This is largly secondary to their ability to analise an area for psychic workings and phenomina by observing the flow of and traces of trans-dimentional "Flux" as they call it. A Jirrin can tell if somone or something is using paranormal abilities, how strong the ability is, and if trained, what those ability are. All just by seeing the ability being used.</p>
      <p>As nearly all modern technology uses psykana in at least one aspect, this has allowed Jirrins to become expert engineers and mechanics, but also excelent security officers and solgiers as they can remotly analise weapons and devices without advanced equipment. Again, provided they have the right training.</p>

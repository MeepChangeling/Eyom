So while I was jackin' into your planetary interwebs to learn the local lingo, I stumbled across some yokel who just so happens to share my handle. I had a laugh, checked out his vids, forgot the old language aquisison modual was running and tried to figure out what his sign off meant. Turns out it was refrence to the Red Green Show, I saw some of that and found a brother. By the time I finished watching, the modual had finished and... Well, any time I want to use a human langauge I’m stuck invoking the lingua franka of Kanuckistan. You’ll just have to deal with it, bud. Now about your orbital debries... How's 89 trillion Space Bucks sound?"</p>

        <p><b>Name:</b> Autonomous Void Engineer (A.V.E.)<br>
          <b>Sexes:</b> Male.<br>
          <b>Chassies:</b> Core systems located within an autonamious scrapyard, but acts through purpose built platforms refered to as "chassies".<br>

    	<h4>Appearance</h4>
    	<p>The Autonomous Void Engineer is an AI system large enough in scale to be classified as a species, specificaly as a <a href="hiveintelegence.html">Class IV Hive Intelegence</a>. This is true despite A.V.E. having a central core as the core system is at this point meerly another unit within the distributed network and largly kept arround for nostolgic purposes and "historic preservation". Each unit is installed within a chassies, a frame tailored to its specific usecase and nothing else. There are no standards chassies abide by, nor design langauge, nor even astetic. They are utilitarian to the very last bead of weld. Made from whatever was had on hand and formed for whatever specific task was needed at the time (and often disasymbled afterwards). This makes their appearance somewhat futile to describe in brief.</p>
      <p>Fortuantly for the residents of <a href="QuietSpace.html">Quiet Space</a> A.V.E. makes use of a holographic projection for interacting with most organics. This hologram (perhapse ironicly) takes the form of a male android of an unknown humanoid species. The hologram's features do not match A.V.E.'s creators (The <a href="grays.html">Grays</a>) in the slightest and he does not enjoy talking about "personal matters" with, as far as is known, anyone.</p>

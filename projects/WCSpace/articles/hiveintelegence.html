        <p>Hive intelligences, often referred to as hive minds, represent a unique category of sentient entities characterized by collective consciousness and coordination across multiple bodies or nodes. These intelligences exhibit various forms and structures, each with distinct mechanisms of control, communication, and functionality. This article delineates the classifications of hive intelligences, with a particular focus on the Class IIb Overmind due to the risks involved with interacting with them.</p>
        <h4>Classification Categories</h4>
        <p>Hive intelligences are classified based on the nature and structure of their collective consciousness. The primary categories are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Class I:</b> Collective Hive</li>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <li><i>Description:</i> A Class I Collective Hive consists of numerous individual entities, each with its own consciousness, that operate in unison through sophisticated communication protocols.</li>
            <li><i>Control Mechanism:</i> Decentralized; no single controlling mind.</li>
            <li><i>Examples:</i> Insectoid species with pheromone-based coordination.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Class II:</b> Overmind</li>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <li><i>Description:</i> In a Class II Overmind, a single central intelligence controls multiple bodies or nodes, maintaining a unified consciousness.</li>
            <li><i>Subclasses:</i> Overminds have two subclasses, based on how they accuire their bodies.</li>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Class IIa:</b> Utilizes existing independent entities, integrating them into the hive network.</li>
              <ul>
                <li><i>Control Mechanism:</i> Typicaly psionic, though technological versions do exist.</li>
                <li><i>Examples:</i> The Keva worm of Tellis VI burrows into a host and replaces its brain after consuming it. Thereafter using the lobotimized body as a "exosuit" of sorts while being pionicly linked to the rest of the worm's brood.</li>
              </ul>
            <li><i>Class IIb:</i> Creates and controls its own bodies, referred to as shells, which lack independent consciousness.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>Control Mechanism:</i> Typicaly psionic, though technological versions do exist.</li>
              <li><i>Examples:</i> Insectoid species with a natural psychic link.</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Class III:</b> Symbiotic Hive</li>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <li><i>Description:</i> A Class III Symbiotic Hive involves multiple species or entities living in a mutually beneficial arrangement, forming a collective intelligence.</li>
            <li><i>Control Mechanism:</i> Symbiotic integration; each species retains some degree of independence.</li>
            <li><i>Examples:</i> Species which intigrate computer systems to have a link to their internet. The smybiotic Feli of the Rislic system.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Class IV:</b> Distributed Intelligence</li>
          <ul>
            <li><i>Description:</i> In this class, the hive intelligence is spread across a vast network of nodes, often spanning entire planetary systems or networks of ships.</li>
            <li><i>Control Mechanism:</i> Highly decentralized, with redundancy to ensure continuity of consciousness.</li>
            <li><i>Examples:</i> Most rogue AI systems.</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <h4>Class IIb Overminds</h4>
        <p>A Class IIb Overmind represents a sophisticated form of hive intelligence where a single central mind controls numerous bodies. These bodies are custom-created shells devoid of independent intelligence, designed solely to serve the Overmind. Such entties are the most commonly encountered form of Hive Intelegence, and are typicaly extreemly dangerious due to acting more like a wild animal than a person in most cases (Though they are capable of acting like a person, this is not their default state and appears to take visible and extreem effort.).</p>
        <div class="indent">
          <h5>Characteristics</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Central Intelligence Core</b> </li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>Core Body:</i> One of the created bodies functions as the core of the intelligence, serving as the central node in the network. This core body is critical for the Overmind’s operations, akin to a server in a digital network.</li>
              <li><i>Vulnerability:</i> The core body is a potential point of failure; its destruction can incapacitate the entire Overmind. In most cases, this is only a temporary setback and a new Core Body will be appointed, built, or otherwise created.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Shell Creation and Control</b> </li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>Body Generation:</i> The Overmind generates its own bodies, which are blank shells without independent thought or consciousness. Occasionaly this includes a lack of even animal intelegence, with the bodies entering biostasis if the Overmind looses contact with them. Typicaly the bodies will carry out their previous orders untill contact is regained.</li>
              <li><i>Direct Control:</i> These shells are directly controlled by the Overmind, which can operate them simultaneously, executing complex tasks through distributed actions.</li>
              <li><i>Numbers:</i> There appears to be a practical limit to how many bodies a Overmind can have at once (at least without some means of distributing the networking load). This limit is roughly 18.4 quintillion, based on observation. Studies on <a href="axxani.html">Axxani</a> (a uniquily friendly Overmind) showed limit can be surpassed through technological means.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Network Structure</b> </li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>Communication:</i> The Overmind maintains constant communication between the core and its shells through a highly advanced network, ensuring seamless coordination.</li>
              <li><i>Redundancy:</i> While the core body is essential, the Overmind often establishes secondary nodes within its network to ensure some level of operational continuity in case of localized failures.</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <h4>Applications and Implications</h4>
        <p>The direct control over created bodies allows for highly efficient execution of tasks, making Class IIb Overminds ideal for complex operations requiring precise coordination. They natruraly exploit this ability to its fullest. To them, it's the same as a conventional intelegence making use of pattern recognishion to assess the world arround them. This ability is best shown in these Overminds ability to rapidly adapt to new environments by generating shells tailored to specific conditions or tasks.</p>
        <p>Intrestingly, and criticaly to understanding this catagory of Overmind, IIbs do not have a natural sence of patern recognishion. They can develop one over time, but much like scientific objectivity, this is a learned trait that requires practice and is not always utilized (especialy in cases of extreem emotion). This makes most Overminds something more than an animal, but less than a person. The only known person-level Overmind is the afformentioned Axxani.</p>

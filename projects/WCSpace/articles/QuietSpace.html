        <p>Welcome to Quiet Space. Your homeworld sits in what was once one of the most important and prosperous <a href="sectors.html">sectors</a> in the galaxy. Now its a a shadow of its former self. Quiet Space, now classified as a Class V Frontier Sector, was previously a Class VIII Urban Sector. Its decline is a tale of political shifts, economic upheavals, and changing times.</p>
    	<p>Quiet Space <i>(Previously known as the H-99 Resort Sector.)</i> thrived on its strategic position along <a href="Hyperlane99.html">Hyperlane 99</a>, the most efficient Faster-Than-Light (FTL) route to the old capital of the <a href="GalacticBureaucracy.html">Galactic Bureaucracy</a>. This prime location allowed it to flourish as a center for fuel trade and tourism. Stellar Empires arose on tourism credits, the <a href="JirrinEmpire.html">Jirrin Empire</a> notably came to dominate the fule industry in the Orion Arm for nearly a century (Until spies stole their proprietary <a href="NutroiteFarming.html">crystal farming</a> methods.). At the height of prosperity, thousands of Corporations flocked to the sector, establishing extensive infrastructure to support their operations. Nearly any business which catered to travelers of all kinds minted endless credits.</p>
    	<p>The turning point came 348 years ago when a <a href="hiveintelegence.html">hive intelligence</a> broke a non-aggression pact and launched an invasion of a neighboring people. While the old Capital was in a great location for managing the Galactic Economy, it was hardly a strategic location for managing peace. In an attempt to prevent the <a href="TheAkatta-TherikWar.html">Akatta-Therik War</a> from escalating into a larger conflict, the Galactic Beauracrasy relocated the capital to a region which was easier and faster for diplomats to reach, and would allow the <a href="GalacticNavy.html">Galactic Navy</a> optimal routes to every major strategic zone.</p>
    	<p>As the capital relocated, corporations followed, dismantling their operations and moving their infrastructure to the new economic center. Naturally, the people who lived in the sector who could follow, followed. The rest of us had to remain behind, in a region of space that lost its industry overnight.</p>
    	<p>Jirrin Emperor Kiva IV captured the sentiment of the sector's residents in a poignant statement during his emergency address: "A careless stroke of a pen has quieted our corner of space." This quote led to the sector's renaming, as no one alive at the time could dispute the idea that space had been silenced.</p>

    	<h4>Life in Quiet Space Today</h4>
    	<p>Today, Quiet Space is a Class V Frontier Sector, a far cry from its days as a thriving urban region. The sector has had to bootstrap new industries from scratch, relying heavily on what little technology and infrastructure were left behind or provided as relief assistance by the Galactic Bureaucracy. This transition has been anything but smooth.</p>
    	<ol>
      	<li><b>Economic Challenges:</b> The sector's economy has struggled to find its footing. Formerly dependent on external corporate investments and tourism, the residents now have to rely on local industries, many of which are still in their infancy despite centuries of effort. Reliance on foreign industrial machinery and near-infinite wealth made for little reason to develop local versions of easily purchased or rented machines.</li>
      	<li><b>Technological Lag:</b> Much of the technology in Quiet Space is outdated. The advanced systems and conveniences once taken for granted are now scarce, replaced by makeshift solutions and piecemeal upgrades. Even worse, those advanced systems are now several generations behind Galactic Standard. With the exception of vessels produced by Sauria Shipyards, modern technology is not something produced within Quiet Space.</li>
      	<li><b>Living Conditions:</b> Life in Quiet Space is tough. Residents face daily challenges that were unimaginable during the sector's heyday. Basic amenities are limited, and modern conveniences are few and far between. Food, shelter, and water are easy enough to come by in abundance. No one will starve. By Earth standards, everyone is well off and thriving. But rest assured, once you learn of technologies we lack, such as medical devices which simply re-construct you if you die, which are readily available across the Galaxy, you'll feel poor despite having a personal food constructor in your home.</li>
    	</ol>
    	<h4>Humankind: A New Hope</h4>

      	<p>One beacon of hope for Quiet Space lies within its boundaries: Earth. Thanks to the Primitive Cultures Non-Interference Act of 2893, humans have developed independently, relying on their ingenuity and resourcefulness. This trait has not gone unnoticed by the residents of Quiet Space. There is a growing belief that humans have the potential to revitalize the sector, bringing fresh ideas and innovations.</p>
      	<p>The community leaders in Quiet Space are eagerly awaiting the time when humans will be ready and willing to join their efforts. They see in humanity the capability to not just survive, but to thrive, transforming Quiet Space back into a vibrant, dynamic sector...</p>
    	</div>

    	<p>We, the inhabitants of Quiet Space, extend a heartfelt invitation to our human neighbors. Your ingenuity, resilience, and determination are qualities we admire and desperately need. Together, we can rebuild our sector, restoring it to its rightful place as a prosperous home for all who live within. While Quiet Space is currently a challenging place to live, it is also a land of opportunity. For those willing to invest their time, skills, and creativity, the potential rewards are immense. We invite you to join us in this endeavor, to be a part of a new chapter in galactic history.</p>
    	<p>Quiet Space stands at a crossroads, its future uncertain yet full of possibility. The sector's decline is a testament to the impact of political and economic shifts. However, the resilience of its inhabitants and the potential of its human neighbors offer a glimmer of hope.</p>
    	<p>As we look to the future, we envision a Quiet Space where collaboration and innovation drive progress. We believe that with the right support and the contributions of our human friends, we can rise once again, a beacon of prosperity in the galaxy.</p>

        <p>The <a href="GalaticBureaucrasy.html">Stellar Empire Intercorporation Organization</a> (SEIO) serves as the central governing body for interstellar relations within the galixy. Our primary mission is to ensure peaceful and beneficial interactions between member civilizations and those not yet fully integrated into the interstellar community. As part of this mandate, SEIO has developed a comprehensive classification system to guide the appropriate timing and method for contacting pre-interstellar civilizations. This system balances the need to respect the natural development of these civilizations with the potential benefits of technological and cultural exchange.</p>
        <p>The SEIO Classification System is designed to assess two critical aspects of a civilization: its technological level and its social development. By categorizing civilizations based on these criteria, we can determine the most suitable approach for initiating contact, if any. The system assigns a letter to indicate technological advancement and a number to represent social development.</p>

        <div class="row">
         <div class="column" style="margin-right:2em;">
           <h4>Technological Level (A to E)</h4>
           <ul>
             <li><b>A (Interstellar Civilization):</b> Civilizations classified as Type A have developed advanced technology, including faster-than-light travel, energy manipulation on a planetary scale, and possibly basic interdimensional capabilities. These civilizations are fully capable of initiating and sustaining interstellar contact, and they can integrate into the broader community with minimal external support.</li>
             <li><b>B (Planetary Civilization):</b> Type B civilizations have achieved full planetary colonization and exploitation, mastered space travel within their solar system, and may be experimenting with or possess limited faster-than-light technology. While they are on the brink of becoming interstellar, they require careful introduction to the complexities of interstellar relations.</li>
             <li><b>C (Industrial Civilization):</b> Type C civilizations have developed widespread industrialization, global communication networks, spaceflight capabilities, and nuclear energy. Their space exploration efforts are typically confined to their own moon or nearby planets. These civilizations are in the early stages of spacefaring but have yet to achieve the necessary technological breakthroughs for interstellar travel.</li>
             <li><b>D (Pre-Industrial Civilization):</b> Type D civilizations are characterized by complex societies with widespread agriculture, early industrialization, and advanced political systems. Their technology is primarily mechanical and chemical, with little to no advancement in electricity or space exploration. Contact with these civilizations must be approached with caution to avoid disrupting their natural development.</li>
             <li><b>E (Pre-Agricultural Civilization):</b> Type E civilizations are organized into small, kin-based groups, primarily hunter-gatherer societies with minimal technological development. These civilizations have not yet established agriculture, industry, or centralized governance, and are highly vulnerable to external influence.</li>
           </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="column">
           <h4>Social Development (1 to 5)</h4>
           <ul>
             <li><b>1 (Tribal Societies):</b> These civilizations are organized into small, kin-based groups with minimal social stratification. Governance is often informal, relying on consensus or the influence of a few leaders. Contact with these societies could lead to significant disruption and is generally discouraged.</li>
             <li><b>2 (City-States):</b> Civilizations at this stage have formed early city-states or small kingdoms with established leadership, trade networks, and localized laws. While more socially developed than tribal societies, they remain highly susceptible to external influence.</li>
             <li><b>3 (Nation-States):</b> Type 3 civilizations have developed nation-states or large empires with complex governments, extensive trade networks, and significant cultural and technological development. These civilizations may benefit from limited contact, provided it is carefully managed.</li>
             <li><b>4 (Globalization):</b> Civilizations at this stage are moving towards a globalized society with interconnected economies, cultures, and governance systems. While conflicts between nation-states may still occur, these civilizations are better equipped to handle the complexities of interstellar contact.</li>
             <li><b>5 (Unified World Government):</b> Type 5 civilizations have achieved global unity under a single or highly cooperative system of governance. Social inequalities and conflicts are minimized, and there is a collective effort to address global challenges, including sustainability and peaceful coexistence. These civilizations are prime candidates for contact and integration into the interstellar community.</li>
           </ul>

        </div>
        <h4>Guidelines for Contact</h4>
        <p>SEIO has established the following guidelines to determine when and how contact should be initiated with pre-interstellar civilizations:</p>
        <div class="indent">
          <p><b>Immediate Contact (A1, B1):</b> Civilizations classified as A1 or B1 possess both the technological and social maturity to handle contact with minimal disruption. They are capable of understanding and integrating into the broader interstellar community. Contact can be initiated openly and with full disclosure.</p>
          <p><b>Cautious Contact (A2, B2, C1, C2):</b> Civilizations at these levels have either advanced technology or well-developed social structures but may still face significant challenges in dealing with extraterrestrial contact. SEIO recommends a gradual introduction, ensuring that cultural impacts are carefully managed and that the civilization is supported in its transition to interstellar status.</p>
          <p><b>Observation Only (C3-C4, D1-D3):</b> Civilizations at these stages are developing but are not yet ready for contact. SEIO mandates that these civilizations be monitored and studied from a distance, with no direct interaction unless absolutely necessary. The goal is to allow these societies to evolve naturally without external interference.</p>
          <p><b>Restricted Contact (D4, D5, E1-E5):</b> Civilizations at these stages are too underdeveloped to benefit from or withstand contact without severe societal disruption. Interaction is strictly prohibited, and any accidental contact must be immediately rectified with minimal impact on the civilization. These civilizations are to be left to progress at their own pace until they reach a more advanced stage.</p>

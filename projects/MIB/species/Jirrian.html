          <h1>MIB Xenoglossary: Jirrian</h1>
<p><b>Species Name:</b> Jirrian</p>
<p><b><a href="../files/ClassificationSystem.html">Classification:</a></b> Alpha</p>
<p><b>Planet of Origin:</b> <a href="../files/jir.html">Jir (Kepler-422b)</a></p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Clandestine Alliance</p>
<p><b>Interaction Protocols:</b> </p>
<div class="indent">
  <p>The initial contact with the Jirrian government and its populace dates back to the inception of the Men in Black (MiB) organization. The Jirrians first reached out to humanity through covert channels following the incident commonly referred to as the Battle of Los Angeles, expressing their apologies for a "failure to protect our neighbor in this instance." This communication marked the beginning of a clandestine and mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
  <p>The Jirrians, native to the planet Jir (Kepler-422b), possess a distinct physical appearance characterized by their average height of 4 feet 7 inches, naturally pear-shaped bodies suited for arboreal living, jet black eyes devoid of whites, olive skin, digitigrade legs, and prominent squirrel-like tails and ears. Despite their somewhat unconventional appearance, Jirrians are noted for their inherent kindness and amiability, particularly towards humans.</p>
  <p>It is important to note that the Jirrian people and their government do not fully align with the broader Galactic government's regulations. As a result, they are willing to incur minor penalties to maintain their clandestine relationship with humanity, including the payment of an annual fine, equivalent to 1.85% of their Republic's GDP, for interacting with a species classified as "Undeveloped." This demonstrates their commitment to aiding humanity, even at significant financial cost.</p>
  <p>Given their consistent support and the sacrifices they make on behalf of our species, Jirrians are to be treated with the utmost respect and regarded as honored guests at all times. All personnel are reminded to exercise the highest level of diplomacy and courtesy in interactions with Jirrian representatives.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Operational Directives:</b> </p>
<div class="indent">
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure all communications with Jirrian entities are conducted through secure, authorized channels to maintain the confidentiality of our alliance.</li>
    <li>Facilitate any reasonable requests made by Jirrian representatives, provided they do not compromise human security or violate established protocols.</li>
    <li>Monitor and report any potential threats to the integrity of the Jirrian-human relationship to the appropriate authorities immediately.</li>
    <li>Promote cultural understanding and cooperation through educational exchanges and joint initiatives, as permitted under current interstellar policy guidelines.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The overwhelming majority of Jirrians find humans asteticaly pleasing. Many can and do experiance sexual attraction to humans. Human-Jirrian relationships are permitted, provided the human of the pair undergoes temporary surgical sterilization. This is due to Jirrian's being able to reproduce with humans and the resulting hybrids (while viable lifeforms) being unable to reproduce themselves and having a high chance of negative genetic conditions.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</div>
<p><b>Biology and Natural Abilities:</b> </p>
<div class="indent">
  <p>The Jirrian species exhibit several unique biological traits and abilities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Visual Perception:</b> Jirrians possess the ability to perceive "flux," which they describe as the energy levels and changes in energy levels within their environment. This ability allows them to detect fluctuations and patterns invisible to the human eye, providing them with advanced situational awareness and analytical capabilities. It is primarily used for engineering purposes, as once sapient the Jirrians hunted the preditor for which this ability was evolved as a defence to extinction (As they do with all species that prey on them, sapient or otherwise.). If trained, a Jirrian can make use of this abilty to sence the current state of electrical systems and data networks, provided they are within visual range. This ability is limited to "is it on or off" and "is the power high or low".</li>
    <li><b>Arboreal Adaptations:</b> Their bodies are well-suited for climbing and maneuvering through trees, akin to the abilities demonstrated by certain terrestrial species. They can scale almost any surface with ease via an innate biological ability to manpulate electrostatic force. Their hands and paws contain organells which produce sufishent electrostatic energy to adhere their bodymass (typicaly with an extra 40kg to spare) to all currently tested materials. Combined with their dence musculature, this allows them to climb any surfice they choose, provided it can support their weight. This ability functions through thin materials such as socks and gloves at a slightly reduced capasity. It should be noted that Jirrian climbing will interfeer with electrical signals should they happen to be within 10cm of a transmission cable.</li>
    <li><b>Sexual Dimorphism and Flexibility:</b> To human eyes, Jirrians appear to have a single sex due to their sexual dimorphism being expressed purly through their reproductive system. Jirrians distinguish sex by scent (Concequently they can have trouble telling human sexes appart.). This is complicated by the Jirrians ability to change sex in a manner similar to some species of Earth frogs. This change occurs subconsciously and is driven by the need to maintain an optimal 3:1 female-to-male ratio within their population, ensuring social stability and reproductive efficiency. The change occures extreemly rapidly for biology, typicaly within 4 Earth days. This is partly due to the baisc properties of azotifaunic lifeforms but primarily due to their transfomation only needing to effect their reprductive system, which has evolved to exist with "redundant" organs that need only be activated, grown to "functional size", and relocated to "change modes" (Jirrian slang). Many (but not all) Jirrians have a prefrence for being a particular sex, and will take drugs to suppress their ability to change, or remove the organelle that produces the required hormones to inishiate a shift.</li>
    <li><b>Respiratory System:</b> As examples of "azotifauna," Jirrians breathe nitrogen and depend on a high humidity level for the mechanics of their resperation. They can survive on Earth without difficulty (provided they are not in an aird environment), though the higher levels of CO2 compared to their homeworld have a mildly intoxicating effect on them. This results in heightened focus and energy, often directed towards specific fixations. While many Jirrians find this effect pleasurable, their officials are required to use breath masks to remain focused on their duties.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p><b>Societal Structure and Culture:</b> </p>
<div class="indent">
  <p>The Jirrian society is organized around community and cooperation, reflecting their arboreal origins. They have a democratic republic governance system, where decisions are made collectively by elected representatives. Key cultural values include mutual aid, environmental stewardship, and a deep respect for life.</p>
  <p>Cultural practices often revolve around communal activities and celebrations that strengthen social bonds. They place high importance on education and technological advancement, often sharing their knowledge with trusted allies like humanity.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Technological Capabilities:</b> </p>
<div class="indent">
  <p>Jirrians are known for their advanced technology, particularly in energy manipulation and environmental engineering. Their ability to perceive and manipulate flux has led to significant innovations in sustainable energy sources and habitat construction. These technologies have been instrumental in enhancing Earth's own scientific and engineering capabilities.</p>
  <p>The Jirrian governmnet has expressed a formal hatred for the secrate nature of our alliance and has put significent efforts into accelerating humanity's scocial growth to the threashold of Galatic acceptance as a "mature species" inorder to make official first contact. A major motovation for this behavior being their extreem dislike of intigrating their technology with existing human technology to improve it incrimentaly. Several Jirrians have been arrested for attempting to construct hidden anti-matter reactors within the United States power grid, attempting to add a cure to cancer into common vitamin supplements, and other simmilar means of "hiding" their current technology within human products.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Potential Risks and Mitigation:</b> </p>
<div class="indent">
  <p>While the Jirrians are generally benevolent, the primary risks associated with interactions stem from misunderstandings or breaches of protocol. These are designed to ensure that the Jirrians understand that while we are apex preditors we have no intrest in eating them (While consuming a sapient being is thankfuly inhrently horrific to humans, this is not true of all species in the galixy. Many obligate carnivores do not care what their meal was before it was cconsumed.). A secondary risk is showing the Jirrians we are not as civilized as they believe (They see the Galatic standard as too strict, and belive us to be somewhat more scocialy developed than we are.). To mitigate these risks, all personnel are to undergo thorough training in Jirrian culture and communication. Additionally, any incidents or breaches must be reported immediately to ensure swift resolution and maintain the integrity of the alliance.</p>

            <p>E-0089 is to be contained within a Type III Aquatic Habitat at Site 51. The habitat's pressure is to be kept between 113 and 116 MPa at all times. Light levels should not exceed 0.00001 lux, except during authorized questioning, interrogation, or experimentation. Habitat temperatures must be kept between 2 and 3°C.</p>
            <p>In the event of a decrease in pressure, emergency pressure tanks must be activated to ensure the pressure does not fall below 111 MPa. Should the pressure fall below 111 MPa, procedure E-0089-A will be employed to reestablish E-0089's biostatis. In the event the habitat's temperatures fall outside the allotted range, emergency heating elements are to be used to rapidly increase the water temperature to 34°C. Procedure E-0089-A will be employed following the habitat's water temperatures reaching 34°C. Any accidental light exposure must not exceed 14 seconds in duration. Should light exposure exceed 14 seconds, procedure E-0089-B must be employed within 200 seconds.</p>
            <p>E-0089 may not be terminated under any but the most dire of circumstances.</p>

          <p><b>Description:</b> </p>
          <div class="indent">
            <p>E-0089 is a sapient alien organism superficially resembling a human with the lower body of a prehistoric cephalopod. Its appearances are not indicative of its true biology. E-0089 is an example of both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry#Silicon_biochemistry"> silicone-based life</a> and most closely resembles members of the terrestrial order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siphonophorae">Siphonophorae</a>. Unlike Earth's Siphonophorae, E-0089's silicone base appears to allow for extreme complexity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooid">Zooids'</a> gestalt, such that E-0089 is indistinguishable from true multicellular lifeforms. The primary differences between E-0089 and a conventional organism are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>E-0089's ability to split and merge its tentacles into arbitrarily large numbers of pseudopods.</li>
              <li>E-0089's ability to repurpose parts of its mass to create independent organisms that will carry out "pre-programmed" tasks until reassimilated.</li>
              <li>E-0089's ability to alter carbon-based lifeforms through microsurgery and chemical application.</li>
              <li>E-0089's ability to heal cuts and punctures within moments.</li>
              <li>E-0089's ability to gain and shed volume by absorbing or expelling water.</li>
              <li>E-0089's extreme vulnerability to microwave radiation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>E-0089 has rubbery pale green-yellow skin with a texture similar to lubricated silicone, short platinum gray hair, two pale blue eyes with plus-shaped pupils, five-fingered webbed hands tipped with retractable claws, six large primary tentacles, and eight shorter secondary tentacles.</p>
            <p>E-0089's primary tentacles attach to its hips in groups of three, starting fairly thin where they join the central body, quickly widening to approximately 22 cm in diameter each, and extending for 270cm before slowly taping to rounded tips. The secondary tentacles are arranged in a skirt-like pattern around the "waist" covering the primary tentacles. They measure 16 cm wide by 90 cm in length at their widest point. All of E-0089's tentacles taper downwards to an end-width averaging 2cm.</p>
            <p>E-0089's upper body is remarkably human in appearance. It is consistent with a 22-year-old human female in general proportion, size, and mass. Subtle differences include a slimmer than average ribcage, five gills along the ribs on each side of the body (which can be closed, making them nearly invisible), the lack of a belly button, and a set of small "flap-like" pseudopods which cover E-0089's reproductive organs as a protective layer. The most distinct difference is a secondary pair of breasts located just beneath the primary pair which measures 1 cup size smaller than E-0089's 36D primaries. E-0089's breasts are functional and according to it would be used to nurse its young despite not being a mammal. Unlike human females, E-0089 appears to produce milk continuously.</p>
            <p>E-0089's reproductive organs are female, though it lacks a uterus and cannot carry its offspring. It has indicated this normal for its species, as they reproduce via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism">commensalism</a> by implating their eggs into another organism, hijacking that organism's reproductive process. E-0089 has indicated the majority of its species is more parasitic than symbiotic as they do not express any concern for their hosts, nor seek willing hosts. E-0089 claims to be opposed to this philosophy.</p>
            <p>E-0089's reproductive process is facilitated by its unique ability to transform other species through chemical and surgical means via the use of its tentacles. It will first prepare a host to endure the physical conditions of carrying its eggs, including constructing an appropriate incubation pouch within an office if the chosen host lacks one. If given sufficient time, E-0089 will induce hormonal shifts to prevent the host from experiencing pain, distress, and discomfort (It has said this is atypical for its species). It appears to have a biological imperative to lay eggs if it is carrying them, as when a host is available but time is lacking E-0089 will make use of them despite causing pain, which appears to inflict genuine distress on E-0089. E-0089 will also release eggs into the open water if it is not supplied with a host once every 3 years.</p>
            <p><s>While E-0089's ovipositor inflates to a size safe for the host during implantation, any host it is provided should preferably express a preference for "larger" partners.</s> E-0089 is no longer to be provided with hosts. If left conscious long enough to need to cycle its eggs, the eggs will be skimmed from their habitat and incinerated.</p>
            <p>E-0089's transformative abilities are far more extensive than merely facilitating its reproduction. It claims to have been a "form crafter" within its own culture, a job similar to a plastic and/or cosmetic surgeon. If asked E-0089 is capable of altering, adding to, or subtracting from an individual's biology in nearly any way they might desire. The process is long and involved, and E-0089 refuses to perform it without making use of an induced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostasis">biostasis</a> on its "patient". Altering an individual can take hours to days of work on E-0089's part, as such, it refuses to do so without compensation (typically better quality rations) with four exceptions it deemed "medically necessary".</p>
            <p>E-0089's containment procedures are based on its amphibious nature. E-0089 is capable of surviving at any depth found on Earth as well as on the surface. However, if subjected to the conditions of the deepest parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadal_zone">hadalpelagic zone</a> it will enter biostasis and begin to float upwards until it reaches a depth with less pressure. This natural process cannot be overcome and is thus a safe and easy means of containment as while in biostasis E-0089 can go without food for several years at a time.</p>
            <p>E-0089 is unique among its species (according to itself) for its ability to take on a functional humanoid form. It can expel most of its contained water to shrink its tentacles sufficiently to twist and fuse them into legs, with which it is capable of locomotion to a similar extent to a normal human. E-0089 purports to have trained at using its "human form" while en route to Earth, intending to immigrate due to hearing a rumor that Earthlings will mate with "anything" and its purported greatest desire is finding a willing mate with which to raise a family.</p>
            <p>E-0089's stated goal on Earth is to locate a suitable mate and live a normal life. Due to its inability to conceal itself properly and the transformative abilities, it possesses (and its compulsion to make use of them on some individuals) E-0089 is slated for indefinite containment pending a return to its planet of origin.</p>

          <p><b>Addendum 1:</b> Reproduction Test Log</p>
          <div class="indent">
            <p><b>Test Purpose:</b> Determine risk of public discovery of extra terrestrial life if E-0089 were allowed to immigrate and take a family. Determine risk to host if E-0089 is allowed to reproduce.</p>
            <p><b>Proceadure:</b> E-0089 was awakened from biostasis and provided with one human female volunteer (hence Test Subject 1 aka TS-1). The intended test was explained to E-0089, which agreed to participate. TS-1 was then monitored for the duration of the incubation process.</p>
            <p><b>Outome:</b> E-0089 coupled with TS-1 for 18 hours, during which time it performed several alterations to TS-1's biology to facilitate the incubation process. TS-1 was implanted with 138 lime-sized eggs, experiencing no discomfort nor complications from the implantation process. TS-1 remained host to the eggs for 674 days, during which time she experienced a heightened libido, genuine distress at being away from E-0089, and markedly improved immune health. TS-1 was observed while laying the incubated eggs which had roughly doubled in volume. The laying process took 14 hours to finish.</p>
            <p><b>Results:</b> A study of the eggs showed a mere 8 to be viable. E-0089 was asked if this was typical of its reproduction, answering in the negative that the "survivors" were notably higher than normal. It asked for its eggs to be allowed to hatch. Permission was denied, and all eggs were destroyed via incineration.</p>
            <p><b>Conclusion:</b> E-0089's reproduction deemed too likly to break the scilence. E-0089 was slated for containment until it could be returned to its planet of origin.</p>
          </div>
          <p><b>Addendum 2:</b> Transformative Capabilities Test Log</p>
          <div class="indent">
            <p><b>Test Purpose:</b> Determine the extent of E-0089's ability to alter and sculpt the forms of living creatures.</p>
            <p><b>Proceadure:</b> E-0089 was awakened from biostatis and provided with four standard laboratory rats, two standard laboratory monkies, and one human male volunteer (hence TS-2). It was informed as to the purpose of the test and asked to perform specific modifications to each organism in the test. E-0089 initially refused but agreed to perform the test when promised 4 kg of Atlantic Salmon. All test subjects were monitored post-operation for 90 days. Modifications requested were:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Rat 1: Remove excess body fat.</li>
              <li>Rat 2: Correct a birth defect resulting in twisted hind legs.</li>
              <li>Rat 3: Perform a sex change.</li>
              <li>Rat 4: Perform a triple bypass.</li>
              <li>Monky 1: Improve cognitive ability.</li>
              <li>Monkey 2: Alter apparent species from Bonnet macaque to Barbary macaque.</li>
              <li>TS-2: Replace left arm (previously lost while on Field Assignment).</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Outome:</b> E-0089 preformed each requested operation in sequence. Each rat was operated on within 45 minutes. Monkey 1's operation required 48 hours, with E-0089 warning it lacked the skill to perform neurosurgery of this type with a high chance of success and was only willing to attempt the operation due to its "patient" being an animal. Monkey 2's operation was completed in 14 hours. TS-2 was placed into biostasis by E-0089 for 8 days, during which time a new arm was grown, attached, and blended into their existing biology, and E-0089 performed an unrequested sex change operation.</p>
            <p><b>Results:</b> All rat operations were successful, with each individual returning to the general testing population after being given a clean bill of health. Monkey 1's operation was a failure resulting in a slight cognative decline, but no other health complications. Monkey 2 was successfully cosmetically altered, causing it mental distress but no physical harm.</p>
            <p>TS-2 was discovered to have been a closeted transman post-operation and informed MIB scientists they had whispered a personal request to perform the sex change to E-0089 while being put into biostasis. E-0089 agreed to do so without hesitation, seemingly distressed about TS-2's nature and desiring nothing less than to be as helpful as possible. TS-2 gained all functionality of a human male, with most of their tissue having been re-encoded as male by E-0089 somehow converting one of TS-2's X-chromosomes into a Y and successfully recombining and resequencing their genome without disrupting their consciousness. TS-2 proved to be healthy and was able to father several children, dying from unrelated lung cancer 20 years post-test due to smoking.</p>
            <p><b>Conclusion:</b> E-0089's "Form Sculpting" ability is incredibly powerful, representing a great medical and espionage asset for MIB personnel. E-0089's Form Sculpting may be utilized for any official business in which it is deemed necessary or practical. Requests are to be made using Form-E-089-A.</p>
          </div>
          <p><b>Addendum 3:</b> Escape</p>
          <div class="indent">
            <p>E-0089 escaped containment at 2208 hours on 09/09/2009. It remains at large within the Haven Town of Willow Creek, protected by the MRU and Federal Regulations pertaining to Haven Towns. It is to be reclaimed imeadiatly if it ever leaves the city limits.</p>
            <p>E-0089's escape was facilitated by Agent R34 (also at large) the ranking agent in charge of E-0089's containment at the time of the escape. Investigation into R34 revealed they had spent months planning the escape to ensure it would be not only possible but almost assured. They arranged for all other agents and staff on duty with E-0089 to have a 3-day weekend volunteering to manage containment alone due to "She's asleep 24/7. One person can manage this for a few days on their own.". Site management had no objections to the proposal and authorized the team's leave.</p>
            <p>On the second day of leave, R34 hacked the camera feeds and played an hour-long loop of previously recorded data for the cameras and attached sensor network. They neglected to naturalize the backup camera feed system (likely due to ignorance of its existence), but were not caught due to the secondary camera feeds being utilized only if a fault is detected within the primary feed. R34 awoke E-0089 from biostasis at 1637 hours and informed it they would help it escape if they provided certain transformative services to facilitate R34's personal desires. E-0089 agreed.</p>
            <p>R34 was operated on, receiving several body modifications made for clearly fetishistic purposes. The operation consumed 3 hours, after which R34 explained her plan required they wait for 2145 hours to take advantage of the night-shift crew changeover. E-0089 assumed its human guise while R34 provided each of them with standard scientist uniforms.</p>
            <p>When the designated time arrived, E-0089 and R34 simply walked out the front door with the rest of the staff, blending in by having E-0089 keep its head down and pretend to be ill while R34 "Escorted them to their car."</p>
            <p>The head of Security for Site 51 was fired following this incident.</p>

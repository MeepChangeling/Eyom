  <h1>MIB Extraterestrial Object Classification System</h1>
    <p><b>Alpha (MIB-A):</b></p>
        <p class="indent">Entities or objects classified as MIB-A pose minimal threat or disruption. They might exhibit unusual properties but are generally safe for containment and study. Examples include harmless alien flora or non-aggressive life forms.</p>

    <p><b>Bravo (MIB-B):</b></p>
        <p class="indent">MIB-B entities or objects present a moderate level of danger and require more secure containment measures. This includes aggressive alien species and objects with potentially harmful effects that can be managed with proper precautions.</p>

    <p><b>Charlie (MIB-C):</b></p>
        <p class="indent">Entities or objects falling under EAO-C are considered highly dangerous and may pose a significant risk to both the terrestrial environment and any interacting entities. These anomalies require strict containment and thorough research to understand their properties.</p>

    <p><b>Delta (MIB-D):</b></p>
        <p class="indent">Reserved for entities or objects that defy current understanding and are extremely hazardous. MIB-D anomalies pose an existential threat. Specialized protocols and advanced technologies are needed for containment and research. Extermination is authroised if possible.</p>

    <p><b>Omega (MIB-O):</b></p>
        <p class="indent">The highest level of threat, MIB-O anomalies are apocalyptic in nature. They can potentially bring about catastrophic events or have the ability to reshape entire worlds. Extermination / Distruction is of utmost priority, and extreme caution is advised.</p>

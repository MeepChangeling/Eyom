    <h1>Galactic Policy Overview</h1>
  <p>The intricate landscape of interstellar politics is governed by a series of policies and regulations established by the Galactic Federation. This document provides an overview of the key policies that impact humanity's clandestine interactions with extraterrestrial species, with a focus on our relationship with the Jirrians.</p>
  <h2>1. Classification of Species</h2>
  <p>Species within the Galactic Federation are classified based on their technological and social development. This classification influences the level of interaction permitted between different species. The system used is the Kelis-Molvak Scale of Development:</p>

  <p>The purpose of this system is to determine what species are "worth interacting with", with the minimum threahold for interaction being a combined total of 4 points. This is seen as the "minimum floor" for either enough technological power to be a usefull trade partner, or enough scocial development to be able to interact with the Galatic government. Humanity is currently classified as an E-IV species with 3 points, while the Jirrians hold a G-VII classification.</p>
  <h2>2. Non-Interference Directive</h2>
  <p>One of the cornerstone policies of the Galactic Federation is the Non-Interference Directive. This directive mandates that advanced species must not interfere with the natural development of less advanced species. Key points include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced species are prohibited from openly revealing their existence to less advanced species.</li>
    <li>Technological and cultural exchanges must be carefully managed to prevent disruptive influences.</li>
    <li>Violations of this directive result in significant penalties, including fines and restrictions on interstellar activities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Jirrians' interactions with humanity, despite the directive, are managed through covert channels to minimize the risk of exposure and disruption with the human public. If the public learned of these interactions the fines the Jirrians pay for interacting with us would quintupple, and they woudl likly face a trade embargo for 5 years.</p>
  <h2>3. Clandestine Alliance Agreements</h2>
  <p>Under certain circumstances, the Galactic Federation allows for the establishment of clandestine alliances between advanced and less advanced species. These agreements are subject to strict oversight and must demonstrate clear mutual benefits. Key conditions include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All interactions must be kept confidential and conducted through secure channels.</li>
    <li>Benefits provided to the less advanced species must not significantly alter their developmental trajectory.</li>
    <li>Annual reviews and audits are conducted to ensure compliance with Galactic Federation regulations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The alliance between humanity and the Jirrians is a prime example of such an agreement, with both parties benefiting from technological exchange and strategic cooperation.</p>
  <h2>4. Penalties and Enforcement</h2>
  <p>Violations of Galactic Federation policies are met with strict penalties to ensure compliance and maintain order within the interstellar community. These penalties include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fines:</b> Monetary penalties proportional to the severity of the violation.</li>
    <li><b>Activity Restrictions:</b> Limitations on interstellar travel and trade for the offending species.</li>
    <li><b>Diplomatic Sanctions:</b> Suspension of diplomatic relations and privileges within the Galactic Federation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Jirrians, in their willingness to maintain a clandestine alliance with humanity, voluntarily pay an annual fine equivalent to 1.85% of their Republic's GDP, acknowledging the minor infractions associated with their support.</p>
  <h2>5. Evolution of Galactic Policies</h2>
  <p>Galactic policies are not static and evolve in response to new discoveries, technological advancements, and changing political landscapes. The following trends are currently influencing policy development:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Increased Focus on Sustainability:</b> Policies are being adapted to promote environmental sustainability and resource conservation across the galaxy. This is due to simple nessessity for advanced civilizations with planetary populations in the range of billions, and especialy so on artifical habitatats such as colony stations.</li>
    <li><b>Technological Equilibrium:</b> Efforts are being made to balance technological advancements among member species to prevent significant disparities and potential conflicts.</li>
    <li><b>Enhanced Security Measures:</b> Strengthening of security protocols to protect against threats such as piracy, espionage, and interstellar terrorism.</li>
  </ul>

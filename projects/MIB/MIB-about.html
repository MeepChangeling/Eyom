          <h1>MIB About</h1>
          <p>The Meteorite Investigation Bureau <i>(aka "Men in Black" aka MIB)</i> has been an unwavering force in safeguarding America <i>(and by extention Earth)</i> from extraterrestrial threats since 1942 <i>(see MIB <a href="files/MIB-IR01.html">Incident Report 01: The Battle of Los Angeles</a>)</i>. Born from the recognition of the need for guardians against otherworldly forces, the organization's origins are rooted in the undeniable fact that we are not alone in the universe.</p>
          <p>As we navigate the ever-changing landscape of our world and the advancements in technology, the MIB has evolved, remaining in the shadows but shaping history. Though our existence remains hidden from the public eye, our influence ensures humanity's survival in the face of intergalactic challenges.</p>
          <p>Our primary mission is clearâ€”to monitor, manage, and mitigate extraterrestrial activity on Earth. This encompasses identifying and neutralizing alien threats, regulating alien immigration, and, crucially, maintaining the secrecy of extraterrestrial existence from the general populace.</p>
          <p>As our organization operates primarily out of regional cells to ensure compartmentaization and operational security, individual Agents are the backbone of our organization. Each and every one of them works tirelessly to preserve the delicate balance between Earth and the cosmos. Our commitment extends beyond borders, as we collaborate with alien civilizations to foster peaceful relations with interglatic powers.</p>
          <h2>General Methods</h2>
          <p>Agents of the MIB operate covertly, armed with cutting-edge technology and specialized training to navigate extraterrestrial encounters. The Neuralyzer <i>(name and likeness approved for use in film to obfuscate the real device's existance)</i>, a cornerstone of our arsenal, erases memories of alien interactions, safeguarding the secrecy of the MIB's existence.</p>
          <p>Our weaponry, forged from extraterrestrial technology, ensures that agents are well-prepared to handle any threats. Our headquarters, discreetly housed within an unassuming building, serves as the nerve center for coordinating global efforts to safeguard humanity.</p>
          <p>Due to the nature of or mission, the MIB functions on a global scale, with strategically placed regional divisions ensuring swift responses to extraterrestrial incidents. This is often done without the coperation of local governments. Thus, Agents are selected for their exceptional skills, adaptability, and a keen understanding of both terrestrial and extraterrestrial politics, current events, economics, and cultures.</p>
          <p>Our organizational structure is hierarchical, with experienced agents leading specialized units. Collaboration with other international agencies is essential to address global threats cooperatively, transcending geopolitical boundaries for the greater good.</p>

<p>The name Liza Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Liza Castle was founded by <a href="../people/HrihzarhMcMillanWhitfieldc271qxdz16.html">Hrihzarh McMillan Whitfield</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Liza Castle has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Liza Castle receives an average of 273 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Liza Castle covers an area of nearly 79 km<sup>2</sup> (31 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2998 m (9835 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Liza Castle was founded durring the early 17th century in early spring of the year 1618, by Hrihzarh McMillan Whitfield. The establishment of Liza Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Liza Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Liza Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Liza Castle is buildings are located arround a single crampt cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Liza Castle has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Liza Castle’s streets. A look around Liza Castle has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Liza Castle long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Liza Castle is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Liza Castle used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Liza Castle.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century after an anomalously snowy winter, runoff from snow-melt caused Pond Moriri to overflow its banks and spill into River White. The resulting flood was isolated to the area around Liza Castle, which was swallowed by the waters for several days. Liza Castle lost 197 people, 375 livestock, and 28 buildings in the disaster. The disaster is remembered as the Anguish Drownings.</p>

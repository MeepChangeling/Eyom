<p>The name Lovaton Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lovaton Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/ZlèsêlAitchisonqz9av6zjj7.html">Zlèsêl Aitchison</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lovaton Citidel was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1200, by Zlèsêl Aitchison. The establishment of Lovaton Citidel was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Zlèsêl Aitchison struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Lovaton Citidel as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Lovaton Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lovaton Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Lovaton Citidel is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious paverstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Lovaton Citidel, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Lovaton Citidel has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Lovaton Citidel ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Lovaton Citidel is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lovaton Citidel long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lovaton Citidel is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Lovaton Citidel's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Lovaton Citidel there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Lovaton Citidel was attacked by a slaver gang capable of fielding large forces. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lovaton Citidel lost 257 people, 112 livestock, and 47 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 70, when members of Lovaton Citidel's militia enacted an operation to train a specific irregulars group for an upcoming operation. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Lovaton Citidel's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lovaton Citidel's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>The name Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/ShilelMattinglyFulljameshbc96dkfiw.html">Shilel Mattingly Fulljames</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1190, by Shilel Mattingly Fulljames. The establishment of Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya's construction back out of the project. Shilel Mattingly Fulljames pushed on reguardles, and Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<p>There’s more than one leader in Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials.

<p>Hoyûlà Dizæ Gûchya's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

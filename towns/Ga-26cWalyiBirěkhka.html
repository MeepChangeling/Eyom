<p>The name Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka was founded by <a href="../people/DulcieShëkadovulhbph2l8.html">Dulcie Shëkado</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1067, by Dulcie Shëkado. The establishment of Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka is no diffrent. The village's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka is is constructed  arround a series of premissive paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  village has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the village is well defended against anything short of an army. Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka's brittle defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this village has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka there are no smells.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\ShimmerwingDragonfly.html">Shimmerwing Dragonfly</a> near Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the At-5w Bǐmìjĭ Basin was struck by a drought when Loch Galilee grew too small to continue feeding Waterway Arrowhead, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Ga-26c Walyi Birěkhka lost 166 people, and 303 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 1 weeks, which are remembered as the Hate Thirst.</p>

<p>Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ˈəˑnzəˑt/ /ˈfoʊ/ [morning] [evident]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/Sti̊ci̊qRegion.html">Sti̊ci̊q Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Thugguhzkznun7895h.html">Thugguhz</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 286 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 33 km<sup>2</sup> (13 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1680 m (5511 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1059, by Thugguhz. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Thugguhz.</p>
<p>Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ānzātfoù Ji̊ Qi̊v hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

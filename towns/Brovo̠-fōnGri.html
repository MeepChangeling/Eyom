<p>Brovo̠-fōn Gri (/ˈbrovo̠/ /foːn/ [coincidence] [park]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/ChrokirupdumaParish.html">Chrokirupduma Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/TuprmjagiDiocese.html">Tuprmjagi Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Brovo̠-fōn Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Brovo̠-fōn Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Absalomav2unrqcm1.html">Absalom</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Brovo̠-fōn Gri has a yearly average temperature of 31°C (87°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 36°C (96°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Brovo̠-fōn Gri receives an average of 80 cm/y (31 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Brovo̠-fōn Gri covers an area of nearly 13 km<sup>2</sup> (5 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 9784 m (-10849 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Brovo̠-fōn Gri was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1421, by Absalom. The establishment of Brovo̠-fōn Gri was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Absalom struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Brovo̠-fōn Gri as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Brovo̠-fōn Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Brovo̠-fōn Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Brovo̠-fōn Gri is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive canals mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Brovo̠-fōn Gri's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Brovo̠-fōn Gri's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Brovo̠-fōn Gri. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Brovo̠-fōn Gri's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>The center of Brovo̠-fōn Gri's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 2 years has greatly spiked Brovo̠-fōn Gri's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Lake Catemaco began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which devastated , killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. An estimated  people,  livestock, and  buildings were lost to the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Cursed Fates Wind.</p>

<p>Brightabbey (/braɪt/ /ˈæbi/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/I̋ywű̄tēDutchy.html">I̋ywű̄tē Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/TindenorCounty.html">Tindenor County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Brightabbey is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Brightabbey was founded by Iorthossel Malghum, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Brightabbey has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Brightabbey receives an average of 246 cm/y (96 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Brightabbey covers an area of nearly 265 km<sup>2</sup> (106 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2922 m (9586 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Brightabbey was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1371, by Iorthossel Malghum. The establishment of Brightabbey was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Iorthossel Malghum struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Brightabbey as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Brightabbey was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Brightabbey is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Brightabbey is buildings are arranged within a network of narrow baked earthen streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The mountain city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Brightabbey, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Brightabbey's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Brightabbey is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cá Mbǐy Vǖy was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1380, by Cetrÿnequg Perÿdotqug Wrath Beetles Advanced Giant Scorpions. The establishment of Cá Mbǐy Vǖy suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Cá Mbǐy Vǖy which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Cá Mbǐy Vǖy was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cá Mbǐy Vǖy is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Cá Mbǐy Vǖy is buildings folow an organic layout of narrow cobblestone streets whihch gives the town a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  town sits comfortably behind a palisade wall complete with a timber gatehouse and battlments. The town's timber-based walls have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>A look around Cá Mbǐy Vǖy seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>There’s more than one leader in Cá Mbǐy Vǖy, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials.

<p>Cá Mbǐy Vǖy's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>In Cá Mbǐy Vǖy hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

<p>Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê (/ˈcëʃo/ /ˈëzè/ [loose; easy] [benefit]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BëmtlaciZone.html">Bëmtlaci Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Gêdd2w2fd3zjx.html">Gêd</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê receives an average of 281 cm/y (110 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê covers an area of nearly 59 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1132 m (3713 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1538, by Gêd. The establishment of Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Gêd struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Lëpîfk-ëzè Ratê tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>

<p>Qi̘v Wajqohi (/waʤ/ /ˈqohi/ [recession] [lavender]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BerlowbiaCommune.html">Berlowbia Commune</a> of the <a href="../nations/PichamCommunity.html">Picham Community</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Wajqohi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Wajqohi was founded by <a href="../people/KarzSlugsMorganl4mj3vjxgj.html">Karz Slugs Morgan</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Wajqohi has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Qi̘v Wajqohi receives an average of 206 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Qi̘v Wajqohi covers an area of nearly 266 km<sup>2</sup> (106 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1846 m (6056 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Wajqohi was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1419, by Karz Slugs Morgan. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Karz Slugs Morgan.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Wajqohi was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Wajqohi is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Wajqohi is was constructed arround several narrow packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Qi̘v Wajqohi weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Qi̘v Wajqohi, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<p>Qi̘v Wajqohi's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Qi̘v Wajqohi’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Qi̘v Wajqohi’s streets.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with wealth for a year and a day. One of Qi̘v Wajqohi's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

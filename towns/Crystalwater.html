<p>Crystalwater (/ˈkrɪstl/ /ˈwɔːtə/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/WhitedenDutchy.html">Whiteden Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/ExninlandEarldom.html">Exninland Earldom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Crystalwater is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Crystalwater was founded by Hèsêb Swales, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Crystalwater has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Crystalwater receives an average of 174 cm/y (68 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Crystalwater covers an area of nearly 255 km<sup>2</sup> (102 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3588 m (11771 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Crystalwater was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1277, by Hèsêb Swales. The establishment of Crystalwater was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Hèsêb Swales struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Crystalwater as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Crystalwater was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Crystalwater is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Crystalwater is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The valley city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The failry decent fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Crystalwater has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Crystalwater’s streets. In spite of this, quite a few people can be seen reading and the city has an abundance of libraries. It’s quite clear the community values education.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Crystalwater might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Crystalwater's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used makes use of a large oblong hall or building with double colonnades and a semicircular apse and symmetrical central-plan, resulting in buildings with a square central mass and four arms of equal length. Decorative features included domed rooves, arches, soaring spaces, and sumptuous decoration: marble columns and inlay, mosaics on the vaults, inlaid-stone pavements, and sometimes gold coffered ceilings.</p>
<p>In Crystalwater birds speak prophesy.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿Gremlin.html">﻿Gremlin</a> near Crystalwater are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Crystalwater's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Charm energies of tier 3 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Crystalwater's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Crystalwater suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

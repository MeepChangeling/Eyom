<p>The name Vûra Kîzu Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Vûra Kîzu Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Dyeshov4ysnqrp72.html">Dyesho</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vûra Kîzu Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F). Vûra Kîzu Gûchya receives an average of 163 cm/y (64 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Vûra Kîzu Gûchya covers an area of nearly 165 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2782 m (9127 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vûra Kîzu Gûchya was founded durring the early 11th century, by Dyesho. The establishment of Vûra Kîzu Gûchya was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Dyesho struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Vûra Kîzu Gûchya as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Vûra Kîzu Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vûra Kîzu Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Vûra Kîzu Gûchya is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Vûra Kîzu Gûchya, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Vûra Kîzu Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Vûra Kîzu Gûchya long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Vûra Kîzu Gûchya's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Vûra Kîzu Gûchya.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

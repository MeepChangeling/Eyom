<p>The name Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ was founded by <a href="../people/Máldesr048qas51s.html">Máldes</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ covers an area of nearly 313 km<sup>2</sup> (125 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 638 m (2093 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ was founded durring the early 17th century in early winter of the year 1617, by Máldes. The establishment of Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ's construction back out of the project. Máldes pushed on reguardles, and Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Unfortuantly, these failry decent fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Lu̹zu̽ Mu̹mà Gûlî Mudâ is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. There’s a patern to the panic. It’s not easy to see, and no one quite agrees on what it is, but the locals know and operate under this pattern. It shapes everything they do, and you feel as if you’ve almost worked it out only for some small detail to devastate your theory every time you try and comprehend it.</p>

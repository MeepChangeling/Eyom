<p>Diamondmore (/ˈdaɪəmənd/ /mɔː/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/WhitetonDutchy.html">Whiteton Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/BaldockiaMargrave.html">Baldockia Margrave</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Diamondmore is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Diamondmore was founded by <a href="../people/SērCó̄bōAuraCherishErménḱYa̋mēórErmérmFoxen5ct9aqhnm5.html">Sēr Có̄bō 'Aura Cherish' Erménḱ Ya̋mēór Ermérm Foxen</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Diamondmore has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Diamondmore receives an average of 239 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Diamondmore covers an area of nearly 320 km<sup>2</sup> (128 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4480 m (14698 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Diamondmore was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1539, by Sēr Có̄bō 'Aura Cherish' Erménḱ Ya̋mēór Ermérm Foxen. The establishment of Diamondmore suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Diamondmore was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Diamondmore is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Diamondmore is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Diamondmore, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Diamondmore hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Diamondmore's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is long in Diamondmore.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Gremlin.html">Gremlin</a> near Diamondmore are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Diamondmore's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Augury energies of tier 1 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

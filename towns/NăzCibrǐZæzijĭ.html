<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1055, by Ktîbë. The establishment of Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Ktîbë electing to pay people to resettle in Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ.</p>
<p>Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ is buildings are located arround a single broad gravel mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials.

<p>Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ lost 216 people, 259 livestock, and 61 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 135, when members of Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the prison, which ended in a stalemate for Năz Cibrǐ Zæzijĭ's forces.

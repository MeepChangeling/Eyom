<p>Doe Castle (/doʊ/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BāwkyoīäProvence.html">Bāwkyoīä Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Doe Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Doe Castle was founded by <a href="../people/LithuinethHeylyn9j4s49bd2t.html">Lithuineth Heylyn</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Doe Castle has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Doe Castle receives an average of 268 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Doe Castle covers an area of nearly 133 km<sup>2</sup> (53 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3956 m (12979 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Doe Castle was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1212, by Lithuineth Heylyn. The establishment of Doe Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Doe Castle's construction back out of the project. Lithuineth Heylyn pushed on reguardles, and Doe Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Doe Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Doe Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Doe Castle is buildings are arranged arround a single crampt flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Doe Castle gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Doe Castle brings to mind.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Doe Castle's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is short in Doe Castle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿StymphalianBird(BronzeBeak).html">﻿Stymphalian Bird (Bronze Beak)</a> near Doe Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Doe Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves square dance to channel Mysticism energies of tier 3 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Doe Castle has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century  was struck by a great wind storm.

The disaster is generally remembered as the Howling Winds of Mourning.</p>

<p>Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm (/ˈɛboj/ /ˈbɪ̞zvən/ [foot] [current]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kshizbāj̼Provence.html">Kshizbāj̼ Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/H́il̄26ac5kp71a.html">H́il̄</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm receives an average of 124 cm/y (48 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm covers an area of nearly 83 km<sup>2</sup> (33 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5160 m (16929 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1321, by H́il̄. The establishment of Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm's construction back out of the project. H́il̄ pushed on reguardles, and Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive flagstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm long.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types.

<p>Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible.

I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>

The conflict ended after roughly 132, when members of Èboybíhzvàn Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy's family member. The operation was complicated by a natural disaster interrupted the operation, shattering unit cohesion.

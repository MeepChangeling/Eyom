<p>The name Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/TrieshTrieshRrhithnorj1qm7l653d.html">Triesh Triesh Rrhithnor</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow receives an average of 70 cm/y (27 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6022 m (19757 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1310, by Triesh Triesh Rrhithnor. The establishment of Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Triesh Triesh Rrhithnor struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow is was constructed arround several spacious flagstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Gi̽ Hjeköt Hadfow hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p>Stamtonne (/stamtonne/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/FåtucåwyHold.html">Fåtucåwy Hold</a>, <a href="../provences/BazanKingdom.html">Bazan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Stamtonne is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Stamtonne was founded by <a href="../people/ÊtcoBeebypmdjc5ixaf.html">Êtco Beeby</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Stamtonne has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -2°C (29°F). Stamtonne receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Stamtonne covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3464 m (11364 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Stamtonne was founded durring the early 11th century, by Êtco Beeby. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Êtco Beeby.</p>
<p>Stamtonne was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Stamtonne is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Stamtonne is was constructed arround several premissive flagstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town is protected by a well-crafted cobblestone fence tall enough to provide adiquite cover for defenders to fire from, but no more than that. The town's frontieer-style defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>A look around Stamtonne has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Stamtonne suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Stamtonne long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Stamtonne has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Stamtonne. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Stamtonne's parks.</p>
<p>Stamtonne has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Stamtonne.</p>
<p>Stamtonne has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Stamtonne has a Department of Firefighters, which is responsible for organizing fire fighting efforts during a fire and enforcing local ordinances relating to fire safety.</p>
<p>Stamtonne has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Stamtonne has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Stamtonne has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Stamtonne's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Stamtonne possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Stamtonne has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Stamtonne's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Stamtonne has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Stamtonne has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Stamtonne's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Stamtonne's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Stamtonne vermin leave small tokens in payment for food taken.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿Achaierai.html">﻿Achaierai</a> near Stamtonne are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Stamtonne's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves reenactments to channel Summoning energies of tier 1 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

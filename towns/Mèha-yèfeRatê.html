<p>Mèha-yèfe Ratê (/ˈmèha/ /ˈjèfe/ [real; authentic] [center; heart; nucleus; hub (center of activity)]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NêndënkîteZone.html">Nêndënkîte Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mèha-yèfe Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mèha-yèfe Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Syltusc882wkxltw.html">Syltus</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mèha-yèfe Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Mèha-yèfe Ratê receives an average of 260 cm/y (102 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Mèha-yèfe Ratê covers an area of nearly 236 km<sup>2</sup> (94 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2010 m (6594 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mèha-yèfe Ratê was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1175, by Syltus. The establishment of Mèha-yèfe Ratê was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Syltus electing to pay people to resettle in Mèha-yèfe Ratê.</p>
<p>Mèha-yèfe Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mèha-yèfe Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Mèha-yèfe Ratê is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive packed earth streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Mèha-yèfe Ratê, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Mèha-yèfe Ratê is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Mèha-yèfe Ratê is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Mèha-yèfe Ratê's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Mèha-yèfe Ratê snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Mercane.html">Mercane</a> near Mèha-yèfe Ratê are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Mèha-yèfe Ratê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Transmutation energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Mèha-yèfe Ratê was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Mèha-yèfe Ratê lost 285 people, 299 livestock, and 41 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 166, when members of Mèha-yèfe Ratê's militia enacted an operation to secure a particular port to utilize it for a specific task. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Mèha-yèfe Ratê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Mèha-yèfe Ratê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

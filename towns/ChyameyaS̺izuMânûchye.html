<p>The name Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye was founded by <a href="../people/Dyêref70cb2tf3h.html">Dyêre</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1290, by Dyêre. The establishment of Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye's construction back out of the project. Dyêre pushed on reguardles, and Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brick construction taking the shape of large simple gemometric shapes which ate then embelished with decorative features, but retain their simple shapes in spite of the added features such as pillars, faccaddes, and covered walkways. The blocky nature gives a general impression of extreem age, as if each structure has existed since time immemorial.</p>
<p>Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye is buildings are arranged arround a single premissive flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>

<p>While Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders.

<p>Chyameya S̺izu Mânûchye's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Mere Rila began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which brought great calamity to the entire nation, killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. The disaster brought an end to  people,  livestock, and  buildings. The disaster is referred to as the Hate Wind.</p>

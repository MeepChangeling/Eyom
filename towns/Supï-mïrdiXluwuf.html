<p>Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf (/suˈpɪ/ /mɪrˈdi/ [cute] [helmet]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/DrarkprutiPrincipality.html">Drarkpruti Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Acoli.html">Acoli</a>.</p>
<p>The name Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Trruzhui15q3l0hgai.html">Trruzhui</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 6°C (42°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -13°C (9°F). Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf receives an average of 229 cm/y (90 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the long winter months. Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 126 km<sup>2</sup> (50 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3714 m (12185 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf was founded durring the early 16th century in fall of the year 1536, by Trruzhui. The establishment of Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf's construction back out of the project. Trruzhui pushed on reguardles, and Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf is buildings are located arround a single premissive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Supï-mïrdi Xluwuf makes use of canals for some of its streets. Locals often fish in the canals.</p>

<p>Nëlës-thohëka Ye (/gulz/ /θoˈhëka/ [wet; damp; moist] [filter]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/OrholonCanton.html">Orholon Canton</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nëlës-thohëka Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Nëlës-thohëka Ye was founded by <a href="../people/Ůh́iyk1zn1bv0bsr.html">Ůh́iyk</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nëlës-thohëka Ye has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Nëlës-thohëka Ye receives an average of 242 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Nëlës-thohëka Ye covers an area of nearly 547 km<sup>2</sup> (218 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1456 m (4776 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nëlës-thohëka Ye was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1528, by Ůh́iyk. The establishment of Nëlës-thohëka Ye was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ůh́iyk struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Nëlës-thohëka Ye as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Nëlës-thohëka Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nëlës-thohëka Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nëlës-thohëka Ye is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Nëlës-thohëka Ye gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Nëlës-thohëka Ye brings to mind.</p>

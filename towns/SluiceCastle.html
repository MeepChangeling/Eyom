<p>Sluice Castle (/slus/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/FallfieldDutchy.html">Fallfield Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/FusanKingdom.html">Fusan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sluice Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Sluice Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TsêbHynessr8rmb24f8.html">Tsêb Hynes</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sluice Castle has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Sluice Castle receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Sluice Castle covers an area of nearly 24 km<sup>2</sup> (9 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2666 m (8746 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sluice Castle was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1273, by Tsêb Hynes. The establishment of Sluice Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Sluice Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sluice Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Sluice Castle is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow packed earth mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Sluice Castle's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Unfortuantly, these unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Sluice Castle is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Sluice Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Sluice Castle there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Caypup.html">Caypup</a> near Sluice Castle are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Sluice Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 1 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Sluice Castle since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>Sluice Castle makes use of canals for some of its streets. Locals often fish in the canals.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century several years of heavy rains culminated in a peculiar disaster. A great hole opened up beneath Sluice Castle, swallowing large sections of the community. Sluice Castle lost 218 people, 383 livestock, and 81 buildings in the disaster. This disaster is often refereed to as The Suffering Swallowing.</p>

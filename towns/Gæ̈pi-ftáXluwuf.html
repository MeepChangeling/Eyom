<p>Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf (/ə˞ˈæ̝rv/ /ftə˞/ [powerful] [list; menu; column; pillar; mast]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MïpirudnopluPrincipality.html">Mïpirudnoplu Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tano.html">Tano</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Khêbêv40psdgj8u9.html">Khêbêv</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 9°C (48°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 3°C (37°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 67 km<sup>2</sup> (26 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 872 m (2860 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1508, by Khêbêv. The establishment of Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Khêbêv struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad packed earth streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf's budget oriented are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf shows Gæ̈pi-ftá Xluwuf is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

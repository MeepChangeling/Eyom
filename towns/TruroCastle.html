<p>Truro Castle (/ˈtruroʊ/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/NorwitchDutchy.html">Norwitch Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/WowoufadaKingdom.html">Wowoufada Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Truro Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Truro Castle was founded by <a href="../people/BhrazsoPetersontuc5pwwnt1.html">Bhrazso Peterson</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Truro Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Truro Castle receives an average of 121 cm/y (47 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Truro Castle covers an area of nearly 226 km<sup>2</sup> (90 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7654 m (-17838 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Truro Castle was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1219, by Bhrazso Peterson. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Bhrazso Peterson.</p>
<p>Truro Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Truro Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Truro Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these cost-cutting-focused defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Truro Castle gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Truro Castle brings to mind.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Truro Castle has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Truro Castle. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere. Local law enforcement may know all about them, but lack the strength to confront them and their paid or intimidated henchmen.</p>
<p>Truro Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Truro Castle there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\BonewroughtWillow.html">Bonewrought Willow</a> near Truro Castle are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Truro Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 3 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

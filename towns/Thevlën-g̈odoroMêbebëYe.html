<p>Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye (/ˈp˔aja/ /g̃oˈdoro mɘˈbebë/ [tall] [bark (of tree)]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NahillerilonCounty.html">Nahillerilon County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye was founded by Gril, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye receives an average of 227 cm/y (89 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye covers an area of nearly 365 km<sup>2</sup> (146 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3698 m (12132 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye was founded durring the late 10th century, by Gril. The establishment of Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Gril electing to pay people to resettle in Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye.</p>
<p>Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye is buildings are arranged within a network of restrictive canals streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The riverside city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Thevlën-g̈odoro Mêbebë Ye is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>

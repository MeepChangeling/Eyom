<p>Qënî-ya Bî (/ˈqënɪ/ /ja/ [innocent] [year; period (duration of time)]) is a subtropical Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/BëmtlaciZone.html">Bëmtlaci Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qënî-ya Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Qënî-ya Bî was founded by <a href="../people/AcharnithTrënhesíuqz69k8bvr.html">Acharnith Trënhesí</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Qënî-ya Bî receives an average of 252 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qënî-ya Bî covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3722 m (12211 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1214, by Acharnith Trënhesí. The establishment of Qënî-ya Bî  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Qënî-ya Bî's construction back out of the project. Acharnith Trënhesí pushed on reguardles, and Qënî-ya Bî was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qënî-ya Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  town rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Qënî-ya Bî's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The town's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Qënî-ya Bî’s streets. The town is very clearly a joyfull place as well as relaxing. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Qënî-ya Bî. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Qënî-ya Bî's parks.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Qënî-ya Bî.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Qënî-ya Bî's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Qënî-ya Bî's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>In Qënî-ya Bî rainbows form quite often above the Large Town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Cockatrice.html">Cockatrice</a> near Qënî-ya Bî are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves square dance to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 3 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qënî-ya Bî has access to some sort of functioning ancient infrastructure, whether it's an array of wall-mounted arcane energy projectors, running water, moving roadways, community-wide climate control, or some other inherited luxury. This infrastructure may be the result of a still-functional Working, or it could be the product of some venerable occult engine that's still operational, or it may be the fruit of the labors of some specially-designed organism or Blighted populace.</p>
<p>The center of Qënî-ya Bî's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Qënî-ya Bî was attacked by a slaver gang capable of fielding large forces. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qënî-ya Bî lost 176 people, 160 livestock, and 47 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 51, when members of Qënî-ya Bî's militia enacted an operation to construct defenses in a particular vault. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Qënî-ya Bî's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Qënî-ya Bî's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qënî-ya Bî's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

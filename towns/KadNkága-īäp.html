<p>Kad Nkága-īäp (/gloˈllæ̝sdu/ /jæ̝p/ [smooth; sleek] [pocket]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KïlxcïäjPrincipality.html">Kïlxcïäj Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Yastas.html">Yastas</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Nkága-īäp is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Nkága-īäp was founded by <a href="../people/H́åpx7g7wc14v.html">H́å</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Nkága-īäp has a yearly average temperature of 3°C (37°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a freezing -5°C (23°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Kad Nkága-īäp receives an average of 249 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kad Nkága-īäp covers an area of nearly 255 km<sup>2</sup> (102 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1834 m (6017 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Nkága-īäp was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1051, by H́å. The establishment of Kad Nkága-īäp was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to H́å electing to pay people to resettle in Kad Nkága-īäp.</p>
<p>Kad Nkága-īäp was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Nkága-īäp is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Kad Nkága-īäp is buildings are arranged within a network of crampt split-log ties streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Kad Nkága-īäp's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Nkága-īäp seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Nkága-īäp's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Kad Nkága-īäp's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is long in Kad Nkága-īäp.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century several years of heavy rains culminated in a peculiar disaster.

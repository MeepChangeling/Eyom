<p>Sëî-lotê Ratê (/ˈkëha/ /ˈlotɘ/ [vague; ambiguous] [block; brick; cube]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/JithêmênëZone.html">Jithêmênë Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sëî-lotê Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Sëî-lotê Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Trî7240ifd2uj.html">Trî</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sëî-lotê Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Sëî-lotê Ratê receives an average of 250 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Sëî-lotê Ratê covers an area of nearly 54 km<sup>2</sup> (21 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5112 m (16771 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sëî-lotê Ratê was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1342, by Trî. The establishment of Sëî-lotê Ratê suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Sëî-lotê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sëî-lotê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Sëî-lotê Ratê is buildings have been located at convienant points along the mountain Sëî-lotê Ratê was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the premissive cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Sëî-lotê Ratê's failry decent fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Sëî-lotê Ratê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Sëî-lotê Ratê's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Sëî-lotê Ratê.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Sëî-lotê Ratê was attacked by a group of notorious bandits. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Sëî-lotê Ratê lost 211 people, 200 livestock, and 48 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 78, when members of Sëî-lotê Ratê's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Sëî-lotê Ratê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Sëî-lotê Ratê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

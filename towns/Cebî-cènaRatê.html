<p>The name Cebî-cèna Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Cebî-cèna Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Khèbëdq01fih1j51.html">Khèbëd</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cebî-cèna Ratê was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1299, by Khèbëd. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Cebî-cèna Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cebî-cèna Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Cebî-cèna Ratê is buildings are arranged arround a single premissive flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Cebî-cèna Ratê weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Cebî-cèna Ratê's budget focused millitary grade defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Cebî-cèna Ratê gives you a feeling of distrust and paranoia. Also greed. The locals seem to be very much into scholastic pursuits, based on the hushed, murmured conversations you hear at least. Everyone in Cebî-cèna Ratê acts like they have discovered something wondrous, and are worried they will endure some horrible fate so another can take what they’ve discovered for themselves.</p>

The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Cebî-cèna Ratê was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Cebî-cèna Ratê lost 145 people, 365 livestock, and 99 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 159, when members of Cebî-cèna Ratê's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy faction leader. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the strategic location, which ended in a crushing defeat for Cebî-cèna Ratê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Cebî-cèna Ratê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

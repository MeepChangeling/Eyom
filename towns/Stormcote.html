<p>Stormcote (/stɔːm/ /kəʊt/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a tropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SwynwallDutchy.html">Swynwall Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/PenkhamiaCounty.html">Penkhamia County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Stormcote is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Stormcote was founded by Gersel Axtell, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Stormcote has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F). Stormcote receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Stormcote covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3734 m (12250 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Stormcote was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1389, by Gersel Axtell. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Stormcote was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Stormcote is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Stormcote is buildings have been located at convienant points along the hill Stormcote was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt canals streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The hillside city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Stormcote's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual though effective defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Stormcote seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Stormcote the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Stormcote's citizens locals enjoy many vices and lustful appetites. They may have religious sanction for their deeds, or neighbors might trade with them for such things, or they could be followers of some ideology that blesses such pursuits. Their economy or their social organization is usually heavily reliant on such traffic, and to ensure its continuance they may have made bargains with various mortal and immortal powers.</p>
<p>Stormcote's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Stormcote.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿Caypup.html">﻿Caypup</a> near Stormcote are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Stormcote's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves square dance to channel Abjuration energies of tier 1 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

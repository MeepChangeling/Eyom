<p>Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä (/ji̋ːæg/ /kɑ̄ɜː/ [bloody] [mass]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Gē̌lerkéōwRegion.html">Gē̌lerkéōw Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/CollyHelenaTaralz6v629sig.html">Colly Helena Tara</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 13°C (55°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 272 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 145 km<sup>2</sup> (58 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2294 m (7526 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1269, by Colly Helena Tara. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä is buildings have been located at convienant points along the cliff Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Xtabay.html">Xtabay</a> near Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Yéäg Cār Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Knightschester (/naɪts/ /ˈʧɛstə/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/HighwynDutchy.html">Highwyn Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/KihulCounty.html">Kihul County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Knightschester is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Knightschester was founded by Emma Cartridge, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Knightschester has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Knightschester receives an average of 205 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Knightschester covers an area of nearly 274 km<sup>2</sup> (109 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1176 m (3858 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Knightschester was founded durring the early 9th century, by Emma Cartridge. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Emma Cartridge.</p>
<p>Knightschester was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Knightschester is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Knightschester is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive packed earth mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The cliffside city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The failry decent fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Knightschester hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Knightschester has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.</p>
<p>Knightschester's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used makes use of a large oblong hall or building with double colonnades and a semicircular apse and symmetrical central-plan, resulting in buildings with a square central mass and four arms of equal length. Decorative features included domed rooves, arches, soaring spaces, and sumptuous decoration: marble columns and inlay, mosaics on the vaults, inlaid-stone pavements, and sometimes gold coffered ceilings.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Knightschester.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Knightschester is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Knightschester was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Knightschester lost 165 people, 323 livestock, and 62 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 47, when members of Knightschester's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with the defense of the strategic location against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Knightschester's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Knightschester's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

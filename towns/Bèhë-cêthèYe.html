<p>Bèhë-cêthè Ye (/ˈaɪən/ /ˈcɘʃè/ [Propername] [lap]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SshaumerilelCounty.html">Sshaumerilel County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bèhë-cêthè Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Bèhë-cêthè Ye was founded by Mërmpf̄ Ca̋mē 'Lily Waves' Jó̄s Sérmb Cawmé, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bèhë-cêthè Ye has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Bèhë-cêthè Ye receives an average of 236 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Bèhë-cêthè Ye covers an area of nearly 531 km<sup>2</sup> (212 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5642 m (18510 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bèhë-cêthè Ye was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1348, by Mërmpf̄ Ca̋mē 'Lily Waves' Jó̄s Sérmb Cawmé. The establishment of Bèhë-cêthè Ye was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Mërmpf̄ Ca̋mē 'Lily Waves' Jó̄s Sérmb Cawmé struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Bèhë-cêthè Ye as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Bèhë-cêthè Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bèhë-cêthè Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Bèhë-cêthè Ye is is constructed  arround a series of narrow packed earth mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The riverside city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Bèhë-cêthè Ye's millitarily questionable fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Bèhë-cêthè Ye has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Bèhë-cêthè Ye suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Bèhë-cêthè Ye long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Bèhë-cêthè Ye's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Bèhë-cêthè Ye.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Bèhë-cêthè Ye was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Bèhë-cêthè Ye lost 217 people, 156 livestock, and 34 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 157, when members of Bèhë-cêthè Ye's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular special forces group to a safe location. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Bèhë-cêthè Ye's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with the defense of the depot against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Bèhë-cêthè Ye's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Bèhë-cêthè Ye's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

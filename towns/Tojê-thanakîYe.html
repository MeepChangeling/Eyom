<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Tojê-thanakî Ye was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Tojê-thanakî Ye. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Tojê-thanakî Ye lost 236 people, 114 livestock, and 88 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 182, when members of Tojê-thanakî Ye's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular 's family member, and ensure they remain out of enemy hands. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Tojê-thanakî Ye's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Tojê-thanakî Ye's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

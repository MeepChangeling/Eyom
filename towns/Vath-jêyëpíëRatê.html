<p>The name Vath-jêyëpíë Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Vath-jêyëpíë Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Hebluza2kqy5r5v.html">Heblu</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vath-jêyëpíë Ratê was founded durring the late 11th century, by Heblu. The establishment of Vath-jêyëpíë Ratê suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Vath-jêyëpíë Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vath-jêyëpíë Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vath-jêyëpíë Ratê is buildings are located arround a single premissive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Astonishigly, the millitarily questionable fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Vath-jêyëpíë Ratê is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

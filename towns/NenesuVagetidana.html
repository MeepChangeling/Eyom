<p>Nenesu Vagetidana (/vaˈgeti/ /ˈdana/ [vagina] [sudden; abrupt]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../nations/expanse.html">expanse</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nenesu Vagetidana is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nenesu Vagetidana was founded by <a href="../people/KhêmŮh́åh́i̊kNåch́åh́huPeseshetq4t2ar5b57.html">Khêm Ůh́åh́i̊k Nåch́åh́ hu Peseshet</a>, who was culturaly Ancient.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nenesu Vagetidana has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Nenesu Vagetidana receives an average of 206 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Nenesu Vagetidana covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 0 m (0 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nenesu Vagetidana was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1080, by Khêm Ůh́åh́i̊k Nåch́åh́ hu Peseshet. The establishment of Nenesu Vagetidana was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Khêm Ůh́åh́i̊k Nåch́åh́ hu Peseshet struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Nenesu Vagetidana as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Nenesu Vagetidana was built using the conventions of Ancient durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nenesu Vagetidana is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nenesu Vagetidana is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive baked earthen streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town is protected by a series of wooden fences ringing the town's parimiter, which are likly intended to keep varrious beasts out of town rather than protect it from attack by any intelegent agents. The bare minimum defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Nenesu Vagetidana hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Nenesu Vagetidana is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Nenesu Vagetidana has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Nenesu Vagetidana. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Nenesu Vagetidana's parks.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Nenesu Vagetidana's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

<p>Nenesu Vagetidana's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves line dance to channel Conjuration energies of tier 2 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Nenesu Vagetidana was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nenesu Vagetidana lost 235 people, 244 livestock, and 76 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 180, when members of Nenesu Vagetidana's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific prototype to a particular temple unharmed. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the temple, which ended in a crushing defeat for Nenesu Vagetidana's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nenesu Vagetidana's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

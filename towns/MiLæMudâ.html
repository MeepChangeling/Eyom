<p>Mi Læ Mudâ (/mi/ /læ/ [tired (needing sleep)] [lense]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/KurûkûKu̹chyiKingdom.html">Kurûkû Ku̹chyi Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/MefankhriaCounty.html">Mefankhria County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/WarreneseShogunate.html">Warrenese Shogunate</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mi Læ Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mi Læ Mudâ was founded by Glegfeshe, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mi Læ Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F). Mi Læ Mudâ receives an average of 272 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mi Læ Mudâ covers an area of nearly 272 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3126 m (10255 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mi Læ Mudâ was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1371, by Glegfeshe. The establishment of Mi Læ Mudâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Mi Læ Mudâ's construction back out of the project. Glegfeshe pushed on reguardles, and Mi Læ Mudâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Mi Læ Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mi Læ Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Mi Læ Mudâ is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt canals streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The mountain city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Mi Læ Mudâ's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Mi Læ Mudâ's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Mi Læ Mudâ has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Mi Læ Mudâ, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>

Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>

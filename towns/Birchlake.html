<p>Birchlake (/bɜːʧ/ /leɪk/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ButterviewDutchy.html">Butterview Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/LedoniaEarldom.html">Ledonia Earldom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Birchlake is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Birchlake was founded by Parciel Fitzsimons, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Birchlake has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Birchlake receives an average of 135 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Birchlake covers an area of nearly 270 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6814 m (-20594 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Birchlake was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1288, by Parciel Fitzsimons. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Parciel Fitzsimons.</p>
<p>Birchlake was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Birchlake is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Birchlake is buildings are arranged arround a single restrictive split-log ties mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The byou city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The perhapse unnessisarily well built defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Birchlake has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Birchlake long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Birchlake, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Birchlake's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Birchlake leaves and flower petals never touch the ground.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LeshyLeaf.html">Leshy, Leaf</a> near Birchlake are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Birchlake's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves reenactments to channel Mysticism energies of tier 3 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

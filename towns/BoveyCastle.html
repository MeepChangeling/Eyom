<p>Bovey Castle (/ˈboʊvi/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bovey Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Bovey Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TrênmFehrmanqqht1tsh5i.html">Trênm Fehrman</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bovey Castle has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Bovey Castle receives an average of 275 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Bovey Castle covers an area of nearly 49 km<sup>2</sup> (19 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3488 m (11443 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bovey Castle was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1333, by Trênm Fehrman. The establishment of Bovey Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Bovey Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bovey Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Bovey Castle is buildings are arranged arround a single restrictive paverstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Bovey Castle weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Bovey Castle's budget focused millitary grade defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Bovey Castle proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<p>Bovey Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Bovey Castle was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>Bovey Castle is accessed from a nearby river via an intricate series of locks.</p>

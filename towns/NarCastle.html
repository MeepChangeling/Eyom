<p>Nar Castle (/nar/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/RosecrystalDutchy.html">Rosecrystal Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/EmzadaKingdom.html">Emzada Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nar Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nar Castle was founded by <a href="../people/KhrondriGreenfieldjzch8kzigv.html">Khrondri Greenfield</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nar Castle has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F). Nar Castle receives an average of 161 cm/y (63 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Nar Castle covers an area of nearly 190 km<sup>2</sup> (76 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6616 m (-21243 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nar Castle was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1215, by Khrondri Greenfield. The establishment of Nar Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Nar Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Nar Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nar Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nar Castle is was constructed arround several narrow cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Nar Castle's failry decent fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Nar Castle is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Nar Castle was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Nar Castle. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nar Castle lost 144 people, 296 livestock, and 59 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 211, when members of Nar Castle's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular fortification from enemy attack. The operation was complicated by the army's activities draw the wrath of formerly neutral parties. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Nar Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nar Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

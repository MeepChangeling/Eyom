<p>The name Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy was founded by Getti, who was culturaly Rosid.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1381, by Getti. The establishment of Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy was built using the conventions of Rosid durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy is was constructed arround several premissive flagstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The riverside city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century an up-welling of water from beneath the earth caused Waterway Red to surge and overflow its banks. The resulting flood was isolated to the area around Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy, which was swallowed by the waters for several days. Qieeo̊ach́ Ḿikan Noy lost 205 people, 292 livestock, and 93 buildings in the disaster. The disaster is remembered as the Damnation Drownings.</p>

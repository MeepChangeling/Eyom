<p>Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq (/nerk/ /muq/ [stiff; sturdy] [fat (component in food)]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/VyedlupgláRegion.html">Vyedlupglá Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq was founded by <a href="../people/Vaeh80vw318wck.html">Vaeh</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq receives an average of 294 cm/y (115 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq covers an area of nearly 51 km<sup>2</sup> (20 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2736 m (8976 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq was founded durring the late 11th century, by Vaeh. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq's construction back out of the project. Vaeh pushed on reguardles, and Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq is is constructed arround a semi-circular premissive cobblestone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Astonishigly, the brittle defences are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq is home to a distinct subculture, who are either the majority here or have the dominant positions in the community.

Communities that are not outright independent usually make an arm's-length submission to a local lord.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is short in Slæ̈rn Vávo-muq.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

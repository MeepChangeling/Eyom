<p>Àcha Hozæ Gûchya (/ˈbojʊ/ /ˈhozæ/ [thin (slender); slim] [bath]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ChyâzaÛniKingdom.html">Chyâza Ûni Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/Àsu̹Ûyu̹Empire.html">Àsu̹ Ûyu̹ Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Àcha Hozæ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Àcha Hozæ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Addisonlc3ms6tjj7.html">Addison</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Àcha Hozæ Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 9°C (48°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -7°C (20°F). Àcha Hozæ Gûchya receives an average of 118 cm/y (46 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Àcha Hozæ Gûchya covers an area of nearly 174 km<sup>2</sup> (69 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3214 m (10544 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Àcha Hozæ Gûchya was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1286, by Addison. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Àcha Hozæ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Àcha Hozæ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Àcha Hozæ Gûchya is is constructed arround a semi-circular premissive paverstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Àcha Hozæ Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Àcha Hozæ Gûchya suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Àcha Hozæ Gûchya long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Àcha Hozæ Gûchya has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders.

<p>Àcha Hozæ Gûchya's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is short in Àcha Hozæ Gûchya.</p>

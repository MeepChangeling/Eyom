<p>Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v (/bɪ̞w/ /lʊr/ [turmoil] [common; frequent; normal; regular; medium]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kririsi̊mùRegion.html">Kririsi̊mù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Jaysuf2lh2d61.html">Jay</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 30°C (86°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 204 km<sup>2</sup> (81 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4692 m (15393 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1401, by Jay. The establishment of Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Jay struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious flagstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v’s streets. Yet, deep down, you know this atmosphere is a carefully created illusion. You can see the ocasional seam in their tapestry. You’re not sure what has them doing their best to act so carefree, but act carefree they do.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>

<p>Bíhwlùr Ji̊ Qi̊v's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves orgies to channel Conjuration energies of tier 3 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

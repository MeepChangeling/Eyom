<p>Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v (/qus/ /si̘/ [trophy] [great (excellent)]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/VātuchàjùRegion.html">Vātuchàjù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Shesmêm2q00b1m05.html">Shesmê</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 278 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 195 km<sup>2</sup> (78 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2958 m (9704 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1094, by Shesmê. The establishment of Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings folow an organic layout of restrictive paverstone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v's millitarily questionable fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>In Qussi̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

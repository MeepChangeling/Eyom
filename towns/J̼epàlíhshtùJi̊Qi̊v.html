<p>J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ˈj̼epə/ /ˈlɪ̞ʃtʊ/ [boss] [corrupt]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/AltodålphRegion.html">Altodålph Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Celeblasselxk3qfacran.html">Celeblassel</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 240 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7212 m (-19288 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1093, by Celeblassel. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive baked earthen mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v's budget focused millitary grade defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In J̼epàlíhshtù Ji̊ Qi̊v rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

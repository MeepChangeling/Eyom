The establishment of Kensey Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Kensey Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kensey Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature stone brick construction with most buildings posessing towers, turrets, dormers, and wide wrap-around porches. An extreem emphasis on decorative features and emblishments can be seen even on the poorest of homes and makes even the most humble of structures seem a bit regal.</p>
<p>Kensey Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Kensey Castle's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Astonishigly, the top tier civilian fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kensey Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>

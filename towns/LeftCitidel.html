<p>Left Citidel (/lɛft/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BluerockDutchy.html">Bluerock Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/QibanKingdom.html">Qiban Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Left Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Left Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/BēyMp̪f̄́rCocoMartinSéchībMpf̄yErmp̪ftärAikenph0xnsf9dm.html">Bēy Mp̪f̄́r 'Coco Martin' Séchīb Mpf̄y Ermp̪ftär Aiken</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Left Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Left Citidel receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Left Citidel covers an area of nearly 120 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3614 m (11856 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Left Citidel was founded durring the late 10th century, by Bēy Mp̪f̄́r 'Coco Martin' Séchīb Mpf̄y Ermp̪ftär Aiken. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Bēy Mp̪f̄́r 'Coco Martin' Séchīb Mpf̄y Ermp̪ftär Aiken.</p>
<p>Left Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Left Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Left Citidel is buildings are located arround a single premissive flagstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Left Citidel's failry decent fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Left Citidel is like looking into a university’s plaza on the day before an exam. People rush about to-and-fro. Discarded scrolls and quills are dotted around  city. In spite of many locals discussing academic topics, there’s little sign of any organized groups for any of that talk. Infact, the city seems disordered in general with everything scattered helter skelter about.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Left Citidel's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Qi̘v Stshzíhj (Stshz /ɪ̞ʤ/ [calm] [situation (circumstances; context)]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/AlbridiaCommune.html">Albridia Commune</a> of the <a href="../nations/PichamCommunity.html">Picham Community</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Stshzíhj is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Stshzíhj was founded by Rérm Mpfē̌s 'Glaze Red' Vú̄w̄b Mboīs Sé̄nv Every, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Stshzíhj has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Qi̘v Stshzíhj receives an average of 207 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Qi̘v Stshzíhj covers an area of nearly 270 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1756 m (5761 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Stshzíhj was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1201, by Rérm Mpfē̌s 'Glaze Red' Vú̄w̄b Mboīs Sé̄nv Every. The establishment of Qi̘v Stshzíhj was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Rérm Mpfē̌s 'Glaze Red' Vú̄w̄b Mboīs Sé̄nv Every electing to pay people to resettle in Qi̘v Stshzíhj.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Stshzíhj was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Stshzíhj is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Stshzíhj is buildings are arranged arround a single premissive gravel mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The mountain city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Qi̘v Stshzíhj weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Astonishigly, the budget focused millitary grade defenses are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Qi̘v Stshzíhj gives you a feeling of distrust and paranoia. Also greed. The locals seem to be very much into scholastic pursuits, based on the hushed, murmured conversations you hear at least. Everyone in Qi̘v Stshzíhj acts like they have discovered something wondrous, and are worried they will endure some horrible fate so another can take what they’ve discovered for themselves.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Stshzíhj is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Stshzíhj has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Qi̘v Stshzíhj was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qi̘v Stshzíhj lost 191 people, 207 livestock, and 94 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 118, when members of Qi̘v Stshzíhj's militia enacted an operation to destroy or capture a particular mine. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Qi̘v Stshzíhj's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qi̘v Stshzíhj's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

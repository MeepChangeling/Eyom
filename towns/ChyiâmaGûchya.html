<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyi âma Gûchya was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1188, by Grêl. The establishment of Chyi âma Gûchya was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Grêl struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Chyi âma Gûchya as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Chyi âma Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyi âma Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Chyi âma Gûchya is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt flagstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Chyi âma Gûchya's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Chyi âma Gûchya gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily.

Beneath this surface, the people of Chyi âma Gûchya can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Chyi âma Gûchya was attacked by a slaver gang capable of fielding large forces. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Chyi âma Gûchya lost 254 people, 356 livestock, and 37 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 166, when members of Chyi âma Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to rescue a specific  mage from the enemy. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the temple, which ended in a stalemate for Chyi âma Gûchya's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Chyi âma Gûchya's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

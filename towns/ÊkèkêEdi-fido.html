<p>Êkèkê Edi-fido (/ˈedi/ /ˈfido/ [great (very large); enormous] [equipment]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/Z̄upaguvZone.html">Z̄upaguv Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êkèkê Edi-fido is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Edi-fido was founded by <a href="../people/Lynnette8zx9f3tnxi.html">Lynnette</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Edi-fido has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Êkèkê Edi-fido receives an average of 70 cm/y (27 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Êkèkê Edi-fido covers an area of nearly 45 km<sup>2</sup> (18 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6098 m (20006 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Edi-fido was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1377, by Lynnette. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Lynnette.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Edi-fido was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Edi-fido is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Edi-fido is was constructed arround several premissive paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Êkèkê Edi-fido's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Edi-fido has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Êkèkê Edi-fido ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Edi-fido's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is skipped in Êkèkê Edi-fido.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

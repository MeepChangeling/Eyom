<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan (/ˈmæi/ /lan/ [powerful] [sausage]) is a subtropical Large Town located in <a href="../subprovences/AhaloraParish.html">Ahalora Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/DewlǐqDistrict.html">Dewlǐq District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fìkh Mæi Lan is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Fìkh Mæi Lan was founded by <a href="../people/HippoperaTrgfërr74lypl09.html">Hippopera Trgfë</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan has a yearly average temperature of 32°C (89°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 37°C (98°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 28°C (82°F). Fìkh Mæi Lan receives an average of 225 cm/y (88 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Fìkh Mæi Lan covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8538 m (-14937 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1145, by Hippopera Trgfë. The establishment of Fìkh Mæi Lan was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Hippopera Trgfë electing to pay people to resettle in Fìkh Mæi Lan.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fìkh Mæi Lan is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan is was constructed arround several spacious paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town sits comfortably behind a palisade wall complete with a timber gatehouse and battlments. Unfortuantly, these timber-based walls are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Fìkh Mæi Lan ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Fìkh Mæi Lan is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Fìkh Mæi Lan was like during the glorydays.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Fìkh Mæi Lan. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Fìkh Mæi Lan's parks.</p>

<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Fìkh Mæi Lan's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large Town. Fìkh Mæi Lan's grid is powered by a god's will and kindness.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Fìkh Mæi Lan's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>In Fìkh Mæi Lan there are no smells.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Shredskin.html">Shredskin</a> near Fìkh Mæi Lan are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves drinking to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 1 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Fìkh Mæi Lan's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Fìkh Mæi Lan suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

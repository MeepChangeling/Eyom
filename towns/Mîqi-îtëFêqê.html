<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê (/ˈmɪqi/ /ˈɪtë/ [accurate] [pain; agony]) is a temperate Town located in the <a href="../provences/QíithtathêZone.html">Qíithtathê Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mîqi-îtë Fêqê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Mîqi-îtë Fêqê was founded by <a href="../people/ZënkèjBreshejrh5tjhn29.html">Zënkèj Breshe</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Mîqi-îtë Fêqê receives an average of 145 cm/y (57 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Mîqi-îtë Fêqê covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2580 m (8464 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1499, by Zënkèj Breshe. The establishment of Mîqi-îtë Fêqê suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Mîqi-îtë Fêqê which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mîqi-îtë Fêqê is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê is was constructed arround several crampt gravel mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the town is well defended against anything short of an army. The town's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mîqi-îtë Fêqê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the town has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Mîqi-îtë Fêqê. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Mîqi-îtë Fêqê's parks.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Mîqi-îtë Fêqê.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a government-funded child care program, overseen by the local Department of Nursemaids, which is responsible for providing childcare to working-class citizens according to local ordinances.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Mîqi-îtë Fêqê's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Mîqi-îtë Fêqê's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by order, symmetry, formal design, grandiosity, and elaborate ornamentation. Architectural characteristics include balustrades, balconies, columns, cornices, pilasters, and triangular pediments. Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. Interiors will often have a grand stairway and opulent ballroom..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Mîqi-îtë Fêqê.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Dlurgraven.html">Dlurgraven</a> near Mîqi-îtë Fêqê are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves square dance to channel Necromancy energies of tier 1 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Mîqi-îtë Fêqê's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Mîqi-îtë Fêqê suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

The disaster is recorded in history as Dread's Fall.</p>

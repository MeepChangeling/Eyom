<p>Stru Kit Gri (/stru/ /kit/ [sorry] [south]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Fle̜költyoMoot.html">Fle̜költyo Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Stru Kit Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Stru Kit Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Molodoryx2lacrsghvv.html">Molodoryx</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Stru Kit Gri has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Stru Kit Gri receives an average of 182 cm/y (71 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Stru Kit Gri covers an area of nearly 54 km<sup>2</sup> (21 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4060 m (13320 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Stru Kit Gri was founded durring the early 10th century, by Molodoryx. The establishment of Stru Kit Gri was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Molodoryx electing to pay people to resettle in Stru Kit Gri.</p>
<p>Stru Kit Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Stru Kit Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Stru Kit Gri is buildings are speckled and packed arround crampt baked earthen streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Stru Kit Gri weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Stru Kit Gri's budget focused millitary grade defenses has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Stru Kit Gri hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Stru Kit Gri's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Stru Kit Gri.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\BloodHawk.html">Blood Hawk</a> near Stru Kit Gri are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Stru Kit Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves line dance to channel Conjuration energies of tier 1 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Stru Kit Gri since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami granted the town a great harvest. One of Stru Kit Gri's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

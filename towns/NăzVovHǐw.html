<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Năz Vov Hǐw was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1170, by Da̋g Ra̋chīs 'Delux Allison' Ma̋mbónḱ Vú̄̌s Rākīr. The establishment of Năz Vov Hǐw suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Năz Vov Hǐw which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Năz Vov Hǐw was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Năz Vov Hǐw is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Năz Vov Hǐw is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Năz Vov Hǐw's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The top tier civilian fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Năz Vov Hǐw is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Năz Vov Hǐw's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Năz Vov Hǐw suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Năz Vov Hǐw was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Năz Vov Hǐw lost 116 people, 238 livestock, and 93 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 219, when members of Năz Vov Hǐw's militia enacted an operation to construct defenses in a particular ruin. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Năz Vov Hǐw's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Năz Vov Hǐw's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

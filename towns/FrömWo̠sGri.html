<p>The name Fröm Wo̠s Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fröm Wo̠s Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Tshêlêd4zrlv8197.html">Tshêlê</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fröm Wo̠s Gri has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant -10°C (14°F). Fröm Wo̠s Gri receives an average of 284 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Fröm Wo̠s Gri covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2556 m (8385 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fröm Wo̠s Gri was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1549, by Tshêlê. The establishment of Fröm Wo̠s Gri suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Fröm Wo̠s Gri which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Fröm Wo̠s Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fröm Wo̠s Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Fröm Wo̠s Gri is buildings are built arround a single restrictive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Fröm Wo̠s Gri's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Astonishigly, the top tier civilian fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Fröm Wo̠s Gri has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Fröm Wo̠s Gri long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Fröm Wo̠s Gri is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>
<p>Fröm Wo̠s Gri is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Fröm Wo̠s Gri was attacked by savage maftetss living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Fröm Wo̠s Gri lost 150 people, 117 livestock, and 88 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 93, when members of Fröm Wo̠s Gri's militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular enemy war machine. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a stalemate for Fröm Wo̠s Gri's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Fröm Wo̠s Gri's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

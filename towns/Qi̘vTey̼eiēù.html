<p>Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù (/tej̼/ /ˈejʊ/ [stomach; gut; belly] [distant]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/KshtilādèCounty.html">Kshtilādè County</a>, <a href="../provences/BerlisCouncil.html">Berlis Council</a>, within the <a href="../nations/TauranianUnitedProvinces.html">Tauranian United Provinces</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù was founded by <a href="../people/AverilOwaines4n26suxmqj.html">Averil Owaines</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù receives an average of 264 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù covers an area of nearly 270 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 952 m (3123 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1451, by Averil Owaines. The establishment of Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Averil Owaines struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù long.</p>

<p>Qi̘v Tey̼eiēù's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings.

Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

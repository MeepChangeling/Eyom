<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Sherch Run was founded durring the late 11th century, by Oka. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Sherch Run was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qÿhtvehb Sherch Run is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Sherch Run is buildings are arranged arround a single spacious cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Qÿhtvehb Sherch Run's robustly designed timber walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Qÿhtvehb Sherch Run has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Qÿhtvehb Sherch Run long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Lake Rila began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which brought great calamity to the entire nation, killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. The disaster brought an end to  people,  livestock, and  buildings. The disaster is referred to as the Dread Wind.</p>

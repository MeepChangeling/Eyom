<p>Bul Zdrir Hadfow (/bul/ /zdrir/ [practical; pragmatic] [intestine]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ChyuwhëKingdom.html">Chyuwhë Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/Moko̠ëEmpire.html">Moko̠ë Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bul Zdrir Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Bul Zdrir Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Bhorlisa7klk7hvq0.html">Bhorlis</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bul Zdrir Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Bul Zdrir Hadfow receives an average of 153 cm/y (60 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Bul Zdrir Hadfow covers an area of nearly 160 km<sup>2</sup> (64 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4832 m (15853 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bul Zdrir Hadfow was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1454, by Bhorlis. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Bul Zdrir Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bul Zdrir Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bul Zdrir Hadfow is is constructed  arround a series of premissive carved bedrock mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Bul Zdrir Hadfow's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Bul Zdrir Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Bul Zdrir Hadfow ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Bul Zdrir Hadfow, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Bul Zdrir Hadfow's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Bul Zdrir Hadfow there are no smells.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Bul Zdrir Hadfow was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Bul Zdrir Hadfow lost 166 people, 259 livestock, and 20 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 49, when members of Bul Zdrir Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Bul Zdrir Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Bul Zdrir Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

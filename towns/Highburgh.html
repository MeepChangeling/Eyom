<p>Highburgh (/haɪ/ /ˈbʌrə/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/LandwildeDutchy.html">Landwilde Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DodbridCounty.html">Dodbrid County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Highburgh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Highburgh was founded by <a href="../people/AlcelatorWelchf17rxv9pqn.html">Alcelator Welch</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Highburgh has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Highburgh receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Highburgh covers an area of nearly 550 km<sup>2</sup> (220 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4188 m (13740 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Highburgh was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1230, by Alcelator Welch. The establishment of Highburgh suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Highburgh was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Highburgh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Highburgh is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive paverstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Astonishigly, the robustly designed timber walls are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Highburgh is like a look into a broken heart which long ago fell to corruption. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need… unless of course, they would be an easy target for some robbery. The city has truly fallen to evil.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Highburgh's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by order, symmetry, formal design, grandiosity, and elaborate ornamentation. Architectural characteristics include balustrades, balconies, columns, cornices, pilasters, and triangular pediments. Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. Interiors will often have a grand stairway and opulent ballroom..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is skipped in Highburgh.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SnakeVenomous.html">Snake, Venomous</a> near Highburgh are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Highburgh's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 1 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

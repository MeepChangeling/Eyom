<p>Lyn Citidel (/lɪn/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BeachdeerDutchy.html">Beachdeer Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MidateKingdom.html">Midate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lyn Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lyn Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/LaerguldesMinhinnickAbramsanmv40fx3p.html">Laerguldes Minhinnick Abrams</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lyn Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Lyn Citidel receives an average of 234 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Lyn Citidel covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1764 m (5787 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lyn Citidel was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1362, by Laerguldes Minhinnick Abrams. The establishment of Lyn Citidel was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Laerguldes Minhinnick Abrams struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Lyn Citidel as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Lyn Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lyn Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Lyn Citidel is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad flagstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Unfortuantly, these millitarily questionable fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Lyn Citidel has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lyn Citidel long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lyn Citidel's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is skipped in Lyn Citidel.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Lyn Citidel is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>
<p>The center of Lyn Citidel's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with wealth for a year and a day. One of Lyn Citidel's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<p>Räz Hyeha Ru (/dub/ /ru/ [random] [view]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/LohupujagoHold.html">Lohupujago Hold</a>, <a href="../provences/SipugehiveKingdom.html">Sipugehive Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Undermountain.html">Undermountain</a>.</p>
<p>The name Räz Hyeha Ru is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Hyeha Ru was founded by <a href="../people/Shêjshsxs2wah9.html">Shêj</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Räz Hyeha Ru has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Räz Hyeha Ru receives an average of 153 cm/y (60 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Räz Hyeha Ru covers an area of nearly 182 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 9590 m (-11486 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Hyeha Ru was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1272, by Shêj. The establishment of Räz Hyeha Ru  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Räz Hyeha Ru's construction back out of the project. Shêj pushed on reguardles, and Räz Hyeha Ru was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Räz Hyeha Ru was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Hyeha Ru is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Räz Hyeha Ru is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Räz Hyeha Ru's would-be-castle fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Räz Hyeha Ru hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<p>There’s more than one leader in Räz Hyeha Ru, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Räz Hyeha Ru's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Räz Hyeha Ru there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

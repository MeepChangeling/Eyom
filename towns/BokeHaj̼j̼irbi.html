<p>The name Boke Haj̼j̼irbi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Haj̼j̼irbi was founded by <a href="../people/Rä̂férCú̄yBabySheerYa̋mēórYoúrmë̌Jó̄shiaiud179gl.html">Rä̂fér Cú̄y 'Baby Sheer' Ya̋mēór Yoúrmë̌ Jó̄sh</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Haj̼j̼irbi was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1191, by Rä̂fér Cú̄y 'Baby Sheer' Ya̋mēór Yoúrmë̌ Jó̄sh. The establishment of Boke Haj̼j̼irbi was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Rä̂fér Cú̄y 'Baby Sheer' Ya̋mēór Yoúrmë̌ Jó̄sh electing to pay people to resettle in Boke Haj̼j̼irbi.</p>
<p>Boke Haj̼j̼irbi was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Haj̼j̼irbi is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Haj̼j̼irbi is buildings are speckled and packed arround broad cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Astonishigly, the millitarily questionable fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Boke Haj̼j̼irbi has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Boke Haj̼j̼irbi’s streets. In spite of this, quite a few people can be seen reading and the city has an abundance of libraries. It’s quite clear the community values education.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Boke Haj̼j̼irbi was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Haj̼j̼irbi lost 152 people, 317 livestock, and 84 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 208, when members of Boke Haj̼j̼irbi's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by torrential rains which turned the ground into deep mud. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Boke Haj̼j̼irbi's forces.

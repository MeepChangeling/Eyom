<p>The name Wor Fo̠z Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wor Fo̠z Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Ýal̄ůg4jhmtj9vd.html">Ýal̄ů</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wor Fo̠z Gri has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Wor Fo̠z Gri receives an average of 240 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Wor Fo̠z Gri covers an area of nearly 135 km<sup>2</sup> (54 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5456 m (17900 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wor Fo̠z Gri was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1348, by Ýal̄ů. The establishment of Wor Fo̠z Gri  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Wor Fo̠z Gri's construction back out of the project. Ýal̄ů pushed on reguardles, and Wor Fo̠z Gri was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Wor Fo̠z Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wor Fo̠z Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wor Fo̠z Gri is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious baked earthen streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Wor Fo̠z Gri's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Wor Fo̠z Gri hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types.

However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Wor Fo̠z Gri lost 292 people, 190 livestock, and 85 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 54, when members of Wor Fo̠z Gri's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy.

The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Wor Fo̠z Gri's forces.

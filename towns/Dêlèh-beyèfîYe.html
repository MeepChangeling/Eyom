<p>Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye (/stɔːm/ /beˈjèfɪ/ [Propername] [perfection]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SshaumerilelCounty.html">Sshaumerilel County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye was founded by Ůkh́, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye receives an average of 159 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye covers an area of nearly 273 km<sup>2</sup> (109 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8052 m (-16532 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1094, by Ůkh́. The establishment of Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ůkh́ struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The riverside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>A substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign settlement conquered within the relatively recent past. The locals may not be enthusiastic about being ruled by others not of their kind, and their neighbors may look askance at the way foreign customs or even laws may be maintained.</p>
<p>Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by grandeur of scale, simplicity of geometric forms, dramatic use of columns, and a preference for blank walls. This design ethos extended to re-imagining earlier styles of structure to create them anew, with a similar overall look and feel to one another..</p>
<p>In Dêlèh-beyèfî Ye rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ (/ˈdutxab/ /ˈcʊbi/ [shovel] [muscle]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/S̺u̹zûMàbæKingdom.html">S̺u̹zû Màbæ Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/TenpethisiaCounty.html">Tenpethisia County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/WarreneseShogunate.html">Warrenese Shogunate</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ was founded by Bíriel, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ receives an average of 249 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ covers an area of nearly 396 km<sup>2</sup> (158 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1640 m (5380 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1122, by Bíriel. The establishment of Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow baked earthen streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The cliffside city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ was like during the glorydays.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.</p>
<p>Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ there is always just enough rain to be annoying.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ lost 217 people, 173 livestock, and 86 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 103, when members of Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ's militia enacted an operation to secure a particular strategic location to utilize it for a specific task. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in victory for Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Gumà Chyûbi Mudâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

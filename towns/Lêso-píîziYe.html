<p>Lêso-píîzi Ye (/ˈlɘso/ /ˈp˔ɪzi/ [burgundy] [topic]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KymelethCounty.html">Kymeleth County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lêso-píîzi Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Lêso-píîzi Ye was founded by Ha̋nvé Nīń̄ 'Jasmin Brandi' Mp̪f̄s Yoīnv Cú̄̌s, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lêso-píîzi Ye has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Lêso-píîzi Ye receives an average of 281 cm/y (110 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Lêso-píîzi Ye covers an area of nearly 360 km<sup>2</sup> (144 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1032 m (3385 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lêso-píîzi Ye was founded durring the late 10th century, by Ha̋nvé Nīń̄ 'Jasmin Brandi' Mp̪f̄s Yoīnv Cú̄̌s. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ha̋nvé Nīń̄ 'Jasmin Brandi' Mp̪f̄s Yoīnv Cú̄̌s.</p>
<p>Lêso-píîzi Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lêso-píîzi Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lêso-píîzi Ye is was constructed arround several premissive baked earthen mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The valley city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Lêso-píîzi Ye, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Lêso-píîzi Ye is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Life is hard in Lêso-píîzi Ye. Its people are impoverished compared to their peers elsewhere. Something is making the locals stay, however, whether fear of the alternative, hope for a better future, or a stubborn attachment to their ancestral lands. Whatver the reason, living in this harsh area for generations has made the people of Lêso-píîzi Ye a notably resourceful and hearty people.</p>
<p>Lêso-píîzi Ye's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Lêso-píîzi Ye the stars are always right.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Lêso-píîzi Ye was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lêso-píîzi Ye lost 237 people, 154 livestock, and 26 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 50, when members of Lêso-píîzi Ye's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about a particular ruin. The operation was complicated by extremely hostile wildlife which took many out of action. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Lêso-píîzi Ye's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lêso-píîzi Ye's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

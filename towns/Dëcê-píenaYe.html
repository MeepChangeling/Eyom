<p>The name Dëcê-píena Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Dëcê-píena Ye was founded by <a href="../people/Kthêv56w1qmywsf.html">Kthêv</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Dëcê-píena Ye receives an average of 289 cm/y (113 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Dëcê-píena Ye covers an area of nearly 268 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 9708 m (-11099 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dëcê-píena Ye was founded durring the early 16th century in fall of the year 1500, by Kthêv. The establishment of Dëcê-píena Ye suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Dëcê-píena Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dëcê-píena Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Dëcê-píena Ye is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive baked earthen streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Dëcê-píena Ye's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Dëcê-píena Ye, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Dëcê-píena Ye.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Dëcê-píena Ye's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is skipped in Dëcê-píena Ye.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Dëcê-píena Ye is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>
<p>Dëcê-píena Ye makes use of canals for some of its streets. Locals often fish in the canals.</p>

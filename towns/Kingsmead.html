<p>Kingsmead (/kɪŋz/ /miːd/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/StonesummerDutchy.html">Stonesummer Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MarlingiaCounty.html">Marlingia County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kingsmead is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kingsmead was founded by <a href="../people/TrînkdsmMcMillanbip7j4rndj.html">Trînkdsm McMillan</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kingsmead has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F). Kingsmead receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kingsmead covers an area of nearly 315 km<sup>2</sup> (126 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3668 m (12034 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kingsmead was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1390, by Trînkdsm McMillan. The establishment of Kingsmead was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Trînkdsm McMillan struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Kingsmead as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Kingsmead was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kingsmead is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kingsmead is is constructed  arround a series of premissive cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Kingsmead's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Kingsmead gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. Beneath this surface, the people of Kingsmead can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Kingsmead places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>A substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign settlement conquered within the relatively recent past. The locals may not be enthusiastic about being ruled by others not of their kind, and their neighbors may look askance at the way foreign customs or even laws may be maintained.</p>
<p>Kingsmead's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>In Kingsmead rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\MudElementalLarge.html">Mud Elemental, Large</a> near Kingsmead are known to be quite timid.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

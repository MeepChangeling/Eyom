<p>Zdo̠ It Gri (/zdo̠/ /it/ [boring] [kid]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ko̠ktugttöMoot.html">Ko̠ktugttö Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Zdo̠ It Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Zdo̠ It Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Brîtco5xu64d43y6.html">Brîtco</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zdo̠ It Gri has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 1°C (33°F). Zdo̠ It Gri receives an average of 149 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Zdo̠ It Gri covers an area of nearly 121 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4258 m (13969 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zdo̠ It Gri was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1159, by Brîtco. The establishment of Zdo̠ It Gri  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Zdo̠ It Gri's construction back out of the project. Brîtco pushed on reguardles, and Zdo̠ It Gri was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Zdo̠ It Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zdo̠ It Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Zdo̠ It Gri is buildings folow an organic layout of broad flagstone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Zdo̠ It Gri's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Unfortuantly, these unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Zdo̠ It Gri has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Zdo̠ It Gri ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Zdo̠ It Gri is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Zdo̠ It Gri was like during the glorydays.</p>

Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, curved windows, and decorative trim work. .</p>
<p>In Zdo̠ It Gri rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>

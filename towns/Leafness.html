<p>Leafness (/liːf/ /nɛs/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/CourtsilverDutchy.html">Courtsilver Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/LedoniaEarldom.html">Ledonia Earldom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Leafness is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Leafness was founded by <a href="../people/FaelielJeffrieszliq64s7at.html">Faeliel Jeffries</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Leafness has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Leafness receives an average of 222 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Leafness covers an area of nearly 413 km<sup>2</sup> (165 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3812 m (12506 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Leafness was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1183, by Faeliel Jeffries. The establishment of Leafness  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Leafness's construction back out of the project. Faeliel Jeffries pushed on reguardles, and Leafness was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Leafness was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Leafness is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Leafness is is constructed  arround a series of crampt paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Leafness, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Leafness is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Leafness's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>In Leafness during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Apallie.html">Apallie</a> near Leafness are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Leafness's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Enchantment energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Leafness is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Leafness possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Leafness was attacked by a group of guerrilla fighters. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Leafness lost 210 people, 155 livestock, and 65 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 111, when members of Leafness's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific resource to a particular fortification unharmed. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Leafness's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Leafness's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

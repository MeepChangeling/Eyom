<p>The name Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ was founded by Gilêv, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1282, by Gilêv. The establishment of Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ's construction back out of the project. Gilêv pushed on reguardles, and Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The riverside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>

<p>Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>

<p>Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with good fortune for a year and a day. One of Ràdû Mâchyu̹ Mudâ's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

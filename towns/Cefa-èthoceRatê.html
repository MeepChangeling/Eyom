<p>Cefa-èthoce Ratê (/ˈcefa/ /èˈθoce/ [instant] [disgust]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/LëcêngthëviZone.html">Lëcêngthëvi Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Cefa-èthoce Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Cefa-èthoce Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Jendethnhiyqkf07t.html">Jendeth</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Cefa-èthoce Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Cefa-èthoce Ratê receives an average of 204 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Cefa-èthoce Ratê covers an area of nearly 30 km<sup>2</sup> (12 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1830 m (6003 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cefa-èthoce Ratê was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1327, by Jendeth. The establishment of Cefa-èthoce Ratê suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Cefa-èthoce Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cefa-èthoce Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Cefa-èthoce Ratê is buildings folow an organic layout of crampt paverstone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Cefa-èthoce Ratê's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look arround Cefa-èthoce Ratê reveals an abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures.

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Cefa-èthoce Ratê is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami granted the town a great harvest. One of Cefa-èthoce Ratê's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

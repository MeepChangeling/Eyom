<p>The name Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato was founded by <a href="../people/Szazzo41vgl95xhg.html">Szazzo</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato receives an average of 189 cm/y (74 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato covers an area of nearly 33 km<sup>2</sup> (13 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3268 m (10721 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1199, by Szazzo. The establishment of Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Êkèkê G̈ndë-tato hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè (/ˈfèvi/ /ˈcèfe/ [fake] [jewel; gem; pearl]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/FîthdekîZone.html">Fîthdekî Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè was founded by <a href="../people/TrëmesmTrgfëmthêj4agq1kl5b.html">Trëmesm Trgfëmthê</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè receives an average of 264 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1562 m (5124 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1467, by Trëmesm Trgfëmthê. The establishment of Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's construction back out of the project. Trëmesm Trgfëmthê pushed on reguardles, and Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt packed earth streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's robustly designed timber walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's parks.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has an Arts Academy which provides higher education in many fields including math, language arts, philosophy, engineering, and other such disciplines.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's grid is powered by hydrogalvanic generators.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. In spite of the Galvanic Grid, these lights continue to use their old fule sources to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>In Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Howler.html">Howler</a> near Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves drinking to channel Enchantment energies of tier 3 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè lost 267 people, 137 livestock, and 86 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 109, when members of Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's militia enacted an operation to locate a particular elites group. The operation was complicated by extremely dangerous terrain, including unfamiliar and poisonous plants which many ate while foraging. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the settlment, which ended in victory for Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Dêt-cèfe Dêtîkè's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

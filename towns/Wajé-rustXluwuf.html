<p>The name Wajé-rust Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wajé-rust Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Trreggu2gz7ftcjha.html">Trreggu</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wajé-rust Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 2°C (35°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 1°C (33°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Wajé-rust Xluwuf receives an average of 218 cm/y (85 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wajé-rust Xluwuf was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1091, by Trreggu. The establishment of Wajé-rust Xluwuf was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Trreggu electing to pay people to resettle in Wajé-rust Xluwuf.</p>
<p>Wajé-rust Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wajé-rust Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature stone brick construction with most buildings posessing towers, turrets, dormers, and wide wrap-around porches. An extreem emphasis on decorative features and emblishments can be seen even on the poorest of homes and makes even the most humble of structures seem a bit regal.</p>
<p>Wajé-rust Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Wajé-rust Xluwuf's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Wajé-rust Xluwuf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wajé-rust Xluwuf's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Wajé-rust Xluwuf the stars are always right.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LeopardSnow(CatGreat).html">Leopard, Snow (Cat, Great)</a> near Wajé-rust Xluwuf are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Wajé-rust Xluwuf's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Necromancy energies of tier 2 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Wajé-rust Xluwuf is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Wajé-rust Xluwuf was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Wajé-rust Xluwuf lost 261 people, 246 livestock, and 35 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 72, when members of Wajé-rust Xluwuf's militia enacted an operation to rescue a particular solgiers group from the enemy. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with the defense of the temple against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Wajé-rust Xluwuf's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Wajé-rust Xluwuf's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

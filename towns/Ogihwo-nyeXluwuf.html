<p>Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf (/oˈgihwo/ /nje/ [keen; eager] [news]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GïtarejéPrincipality.html">Gïtarejé Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Nasdi.html">Nasdi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Qranzorcva4d1369i0.html">Qranzorc</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 0°C (32°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 16°C (60°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -15°C (5°F). Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf receives an average of 272 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 180 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2642 m (8667 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1300, by Qranzorc. The establishment of Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf's construction back out of the project. Qranzorc pushed on reguardles, and Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Ogihwo-nye Xluwuf proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

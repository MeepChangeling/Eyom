<p>The name Salmons Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Salmons Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Raw̄shMërmpf̄ElodieLissoYawmē̋chSērDaw̄shībMalyonug60g5yrl6.html">Raw̄sh Mërmpf̄ 'Elodie Lisso' Yawmē̋ch Sēr Daw̄shīb Malyon</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Salmons Castle was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1549, by Raw̄sh Mërmpf̄ 'Elodie Lisso' Yawmē̋ch Sēr Daw̄shīb Malyon. The establishment of Salmons Castle was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Raw̄sh Mërmpf̄ 'Elodie Lisso' Yawmē̋ch Sēr Daw̄shīb Malyon electing to pay people to resettle in Salmons Castle.</p>
<p>Salmons Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Salmons Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Salmons Castle is buildings are built arround a single broad baked earthen mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Salmons Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Salmons Castle is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. There’s a patern to the panic. It’s not easy to see, and no one quite agrees on what it is, but the locals know and operate under this pattern. It shapes everything they do, and you feel as if you’ve almost worked it out only for some small detail to devastate your theory every time you try and comprehend it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Salmons Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is skipped in Salmons Castle.</p>

<p>Salmons Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves square dance to channel Augury energies of tier 2 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

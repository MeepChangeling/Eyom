<p>G̈î-cèkê Ye (/nɛv/ /ˈcèkɘ/ [microphone] [flower]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SolonbelmanaCounty.html">Solonbelmana County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name G̈î-cèkê Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as G̈î-cèkê Ye was founded by Treshèj, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>G̈î-cèkê Ye has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). G̈î-cèkê Ye receives an average of 276 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. G̈î-cèkê Ye covers an area of nearly 340 km<sup>2</sup> (136 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 970 m (3182 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>G̈î-cèkê Ye was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1505, by Treshèj. The establishment of G̈î-cèkê Ye was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Treshèj struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish G̈î-cèkê Ye as a prison colony.</p>
<p>G̈î-cèkê Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and G̈î-cèkê Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brick construction taking the shape of large simple gemometric shapes which ate then embelished with decorative features, but retain their simple shapes in spite of the added features such as pillars, faccaddes, and covered walkways. The blocky nature gives a general impression of extreem age, as if each structure has existed since time immemorial.</p>
<p>G̈î-cèkê Ye is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious paverstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The valley city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. G̈î-cèkê Ye's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around G̈î-cèkê Ye shows G̈î-cèkê Ye is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is.</p>

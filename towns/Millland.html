<p>Millland (/millland/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/LorbrookDutchy.html">Lorbrook Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/IpoulanKingdom.html">Ipoulan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Millland is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Millland was founded by <a href="../people/WinstonCrosbielp3sr3ap48.html">Winston Crosbie</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Millland has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Millland receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Millland covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3318 m (10885 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Millland was founded durring the late 10th century, by Winston Crosbie. The establishment of Millland suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Millland was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Millland is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Millland is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad worn bedrock streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Millland weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Astonishigly, the budget focused millitary grade defenses are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Millland hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the town nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the town, particularly the market.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Millland has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Millland. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Millland's parks.</p>
<p>Millland has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Millland.</p>
<p>Millland has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Millland has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Millland has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Millland has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Millland's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Millland possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Millland has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Millland's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Millland has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Millland has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Millland is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Millland's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Millland.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Domovoi.html">Domovoi</a> near Millland are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Millland's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves line dance to channel Abjuration energies of tier 1 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Millland's residents established a new industry (27748 % 6)+1 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Millland experienced an impossibly long, cold, and stormy winter unlike anything seen before. The worst of the disaster struck The storm coated everything in a thick layer of ice and freezing countless animals, plants, and people to death. Millland lost 199 people, and 306 livestock in the disaster.. The disaster is remembered as the Cursed Fates Screams, after the sounds of the winds.</p>

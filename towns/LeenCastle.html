<p>Leen Castle (/lin/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GumadaProvence.html">Gumada Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Leen Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Leen Castle was founded by <a href="../people/DalofragrettAldenu2ykcx5758.html">Dalofragrett Alden</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Leen Castle has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Leen Castle receives an average of 276 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Leen Castle covers an area of nearly 128 km<sup>2</sup> (51 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3674 m (12053 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Leen Castle was founded durring the late 17th century in early spring of the year 1577, by Dalofragrett Alden. The establishment of Leen Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Dalofragrett Alden struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Leen Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Leen Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Leen Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Leen Castle is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Leen Castle's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Leen Castle, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Leen Castle.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Leen Castle, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Leen Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Leen Castle tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\BonewroughtWillow.html">Bonewrought Willow</a> near Leen Castle are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Leen Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves line dance to channel Summoning energies of tier 3 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Kad Tmink-fjekern (/tmink/ /fjeˈkern/ [small; little; short; low; miniature] [end]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FididiäīurgPrincipality.html">Fididiäīurg Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Olatkana.html">Olatkana</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Tmink-fjekern is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Tmink-fjekern was founded by <a href="../people/Trruzhui6spblyc0cx.html">Trruzhui</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Tmink-fjekern has a yearly average temperature of -4°C (25°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -33°C (-27°F). Kad Tmink-fjekern receives an average of 105 cm/y (41 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Kad Tmink-fjekern covers an area of nearly 107 km<sup>2</sup> (42 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4652 m (15262 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Tmink-fjekern was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1485, by Trruzhui. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Kad Tmink-fjekern was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Tmink-fjekern is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Kad Tmink-fjekern is is constructed  arround a series of spacious cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Kad Tmink-fjekern's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Kad Tmink-fjekern's budget oriented has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Tmink-fjekern seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Tmink-fjekern's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Kad Tmink-fjekern every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Kad Tmink-fjekern is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami spared the town from an attack. One of Kad Tmink-fjekern's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

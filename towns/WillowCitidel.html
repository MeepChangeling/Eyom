<p>Willow Citidel (/ˈwɪˌloʊ/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/WindkeepDutchy.html">Windkeep Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/FusanKingdom.html">Fusan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Willow Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Willow Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/KrukkikBushxrrgw8ubi2.html">Krukkik Bush</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Willow Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Willow Citidel receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Willow Citidel covers an area of nearly 134 km<sup>2</sup> (53 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5264 m (17270 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Willow Citidel was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1082, by Krukkik Bush. The establishment of Willow Citidel was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Krukkik Bush electing to pay people to resettle in Willow Citidel.</p>
<p>Willow Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Willow Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Willow Citidel is buildings are built arround a single spacious paverstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Willow Citidel's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Unfortuantly, these boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Willow Citidel, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Willow Citidel was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Willow Citidel lost 114 people, 137 livestock, and 65 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 79, when members of Willow Citidel's militia enacted an operation to secure a particular ruin to utilize it for a specific task. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a stalemate for Willow Citidel's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Willow Citidel's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

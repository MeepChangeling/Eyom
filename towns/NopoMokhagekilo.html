<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo (/ˈmoxa/ /geˈkilo/ [abdomen] [oral]) is a subtropical Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/ḾoůmaH́ueo̊Moot.html">Ḿoůma H́ueo̊ Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nopo Mokhagekilo is derived from the <a href="../languages/Ǵawkůvian.html">Faeish</a> language, as Nopo Mokhagekilo was founded by <a href="../people/TasnoraŮh́åh́åhrdNubwenetgrwAhmoseSapairgrwIpuhuWebensenuhrdSewadjtugrwAchillasgrwHarsiesehrdBaqetChil̄ůtsadn4uzfqgg47.html">Tasnora Ůh́åh́å hrd Nubwenet grw Ahmose Sapair grw Ipu hu Webensenu hrd Sewadjtu grw Achillas grw Harsiese hrd Baqet  Chil̄ůtsad</a>, who was culturaly Fae.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has a yearly average temperature of 11°C (51°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -4°C (25°F). Nopo Mokhagekilo receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Nopo Mokhagekilo covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3252 m (10669 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo was founded durring the early 10th century, by Tasnora Ůh́åh́å hrd Nubwenet grw Ahmose Sapair grw Ipu hu Webensenu hrd Sewadjtu grw Achillas grw Harsiese hrd Baqet  Chil̄ůtsad. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo was built using the conventions of Fae durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nopo Mokhagekilo is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo is was constructed arround several spacious cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Nopo Mokhagekilo's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The town's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>A look around Nopo Mokhagekilo has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the town places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Nopo Mokhagekilo long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Nopo Mokhagekilo. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Nopo Mokhagekilo's parks.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Nopo Mokhagekilo.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Nopo Mokhagekilo's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Nopo Mokhagekilo's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Nopo Mokhagekilo there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿SpiderSkull(Tiny).html">﻿Spider, Skull (Tiny)</a> near Nopo Mokhagekilo are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sex to channel Illusion energies of tier 2 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Nopo Mokhagekilo was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Nopo Mokhagekilo possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century several years of heavy rains culminated in a peculiar disaster. A great hole opened up beneath Nopo Mokhagekilo, swallowing large sections of the community. Nopo Mokhagekilo lost 105 people, 367 livestock, and 32 buildings in the disaster. This disaster is often refereed to as The Woe Swallowing.</p>

<p>Nkága-kiq Xluwuf was founded durring the early 17th century in late fall of the year 1631, by Nendes. The establishment of Nkága-kiq Xluwuf was plagued by a lack of willing colonists.

<p>Nkága-kiq Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nkága-kiq Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Nkága-kiq Xluwuf is was constructed arround several restrictive packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Unfortuantly, these Ragnarock-era relics are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>

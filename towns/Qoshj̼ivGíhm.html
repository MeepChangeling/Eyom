<p>Qoshj̼iv Gíhm (/qoʃ/ /j̼iv/ [fang] [rough]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kririsi̊mùRegion.html">Kririsi̊mù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qoshj̼iv Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qoshj̼iv Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Brgfêrí2idrl0fkq0.html">Brgfêrí</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qoshj̼iv Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Qoshj̼iv Gíhm receives an average of 259 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qoshj̼iv Gíhm covers an area of nearly 78 km<sup>2</sup> (31 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2050 m (6725 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qoshj̼iv Gíhm was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1454, by Brgfêrí. The establishment of Qoshj̼iv Gíhm was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Brgfêrí electing to pay people to resettle in Qoshj̼iv Gíhm.</p>
<p>Qoshj̼iv Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qoshj̼iv Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Qoshj̼iv Gíhm is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Qoshj̼iv Gíhm weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Astonishigly, the budget focused millitary grade defenses are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Qoshj̼iv Gíhm shows Qoshj̼iv Gíhm as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Qoshj̼iv Gíhm places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qoshj̼iv Gíhm's citizens locals enjoy many vices and lustful appetites. They may have religious sanction for their deeds, or neighbors might trade with them for such things, or they could be followers of some ideology that blesses such pursuits. Their economy or their social organization is usually heavily reliant on such traffic, and to ensure its continuance they may have made bargains with various mortal and immortal powers.</p>
<p>Qoshj̼iv Gíhm's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century an up-welling of water from beneath the earth caused Waterway Pentois to surge and overflow its banks. The resulting flood was isolated to the area around Qoshj̼iv Gíhm, which was swallowed by the waters for several days. Qoshj̼iv Gíhm lost 116 people, 189 livestock, and 23 buildings in the disaster. The disaster is remembered as the Heartache Drownings.</p>

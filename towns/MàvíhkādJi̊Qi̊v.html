<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1203, by Cú̄sh Yaw̋chī 'Cassidy Cosmicola' Cä̂f̄̄sh Mé̄ Ca̋chīs. The establishment of Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Cú̄sh Yaw̋chī 'Cassidy Cosmicola' Cä̂f̄̄sh Mé̄ Ca̋chīs struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>Màvíhkād Ji̊ Qi̊v's roads were poorly made when first laid.

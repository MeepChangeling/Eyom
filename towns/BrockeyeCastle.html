<p>Brockeye Castle (/brockeye/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/JandellDutchy.html">Jandell Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/JieaKingdom.html">Jiea Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Brockeye Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Brockeye Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ÊgarêbmêRushton3gpdz67y9r.html">Êgarêbmê Rushton</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Brockeye Castle has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Brockeye Castle receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Brockeye Castle covers an area of nearly 113 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 10894 m (-7208 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Brockeye Castle was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1067, by Êgarêbmê Rushton. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Êgarêbmê Rushton.</p>
<p>Brockeye Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Brockeye Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Brockeye Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive flagstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Brockeye Castle's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Unfortuantly, these monster and outlaw focused fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Brockeye Castle has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Brockeye Castle ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Brockeye Castle as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Brockeye Castle's citizens locals enjoy many vices and lustful appetites. They may have religious sanction for their deeds, or neighbors might trade with them for such things, or they could be followers of some ideology that blesses such pursuits.

<p>Brockeye Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is short in Brockeye Castle.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

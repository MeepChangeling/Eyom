<p>Waymarble (/waymarble/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small Town located in <a href="../subprovences/GâbæGàgoKingdom.html">Gâbæ Gàgo Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/QodtianCounty.html">Qodtian County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Waymarble is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Waymarble was founded by <a href="../people/BryonySlaightpnizuqu3uj.html">Bryony Slaight</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Waymarble has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Waymarble receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Waymarble covers an area of nearly 3 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5860 m (19225 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Waymarble was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1163, by Bryony Slaight. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Bryony Slaight.</p>
<p>Waymarble was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Waymarble is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Waymarble is is constructed arround a semi-circular spacious carved bedrock mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  town posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The town's failry decent fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Waymarble hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the town nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the town, particularly the market.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Waymarble has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Waymarble.</p>
<p>Waymarble has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Waymarble has a Department of Firefighters, which is responsible for organizing fire fighting efforts during a fire and enforcing local ordinances relating to fire safety.</p>
<p>Waymarble has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Waymarble's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Waymarble possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Waymarble has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.</p>
<p>Waymarble has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Waymarble's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>In Waymarble during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Gravebound.html">Gravebound</a> near Waymarble are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Waymarble's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves bloodletting to channel Invocation energies of tier 3 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> saved most of the town when a natural disaster struck Waymarble.  was immortalized in song for this deed.</p>

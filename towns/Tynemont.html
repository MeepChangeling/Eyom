<p>Tynemont  (/tynemont / [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/BāwkyoīäProvence.html">Bāwkyoīä Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHobben.html">Kingdom of Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tynemont  is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tynemont  was founded by <a href="../people/KtiliLayton8zc5j1jc03.html">Ktili Layton</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tynemont  has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Tynemont  receives an average of 271 cm/y (106 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Tynemont  covers an area of nearly 7 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1248 m (4094 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tynemont  was founded durring the late 17th century in early fall of the year 1581, by Ktili Layton. The establishment of Tynemont  suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Tynemont  was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tynemont  is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Tynemont  is buildings are located arround a single crampt paverstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the town a over all circular shape. The  town is protected by a humble stone fence which is tall enough to provide adiquite cover for defenders to fire from, but no more than that. The peasent-grade has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Tynemont  hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Tynemont  has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Tynemont . They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Tynemont 's parks.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Tynemont 's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Tynemont  the water is caffeinated.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LurkerinLight.html">Lurker in Light</a> near Tynemont  are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Tynemont 's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves drinking to channel Abjuration energies of tier 1 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Tynemont  was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>Tynemont 's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Tynemont  was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Tynemont  lost 101 people, 243 livestock, and 24 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 90, when members of Tynemont 's militia enacted an operation to train a group of civilians for a special clandestine operation. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with the defense of the temple against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Tynemont 's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Tynemont 's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

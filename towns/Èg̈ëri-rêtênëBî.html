<p>Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî (/èˈg̃ëri/ /rɘˈtɘnë/ [short; low] [fuel]) is a temperate Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/LêtdêsaraZone.html">Lêtdêsara Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî was founded by <a href="../people/TrtëTrêbegag8xx9jrt61.html">Trtë Trêbega</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F).

Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî covers an area of nearly 7 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6266 m (20557 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1283, by Trtë Trêbega. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the town's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The top tier civilian fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Èg̈ëri-rêtênë Bî is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>Êgo-êthe Ratê (/ˈɘgo/ /ˈɘθe/ [ignorant] [toast]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NonabaZone.html">Nonaba Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êgo-êthe Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êgo-êthe Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Êtco70hwwhwjav.html">Êtco</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êgo-êthe Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Êgo-êthe Ratê receives an average of 98 cm/y (38 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Êgo-êthe Ratê covers an area of nearly 52 km<sup>2</sup> (20 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 9056 m (-13238 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êgo-êthe Ratê was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1157, by Êtco. The establishment of Êgo-êthe Ratê was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Êtco struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Êgo-êthe Ratê as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Êgo-êthe Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êgo-êthe Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êgo-êthe Ratê is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The millitarily questionable fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Êgo-êthe Ratê has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Êgo-êthe Ratê long.</p>

Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>The center of Êgo-êthe Ratê's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Êgo-êthe Ratê used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 2 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> solved a major long term problem plaguing the town. The recitation of the hero's story remains a popular tavern and fair tale.</p>

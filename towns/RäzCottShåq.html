<p>Räz Cott Shåq (/kott/ /s̼ɑːq/ [ready] [cart; wagon]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/YåyhäyEbHold.html">Yåyhäy Eb Hold</a>, <a href="../provences/GandlacckÿrfKingdom.html">Gandlacckÿrf Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Undermountain.html">Undermountain</a>.</p>
<p>The name Räz Cott Shåq is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Cott Shåq was founded by <a href="../people/Crocodessiqkh8mfc2.html">Crocodes</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Räz Cott Shåq has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Räz Cott Shåq receives an average of 206 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Räz Cott Shåq covers an area of nearly 127 km<sup>2</sup> (50 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6590 m (-21328 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Cott Shåq was founded durring the late 16th century in summer of the year 1473, by Crocodes. The establishment of Räz Cott Shåq  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Räz Cott Shåq's construction back out of the project. Crocodes pushed on reguardles, and Räz Cott Shåq was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Räz Cott Shåq was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Cott Shåq is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Cott Shåq is buildings are arranged within a network of crampt cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Räz Cott Shåq's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Räz Cott Shåq's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Räz Cott Shåq has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Räz Cott Shåq suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Räz Cott Shåq long.</p>

<p>The name Brun Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Brun Castle was founded by <a href="../people/GärmMé̄sHitIcemewlloYä̌sGa̋chīGä̌shAdlardst26l9pgy9.html">Gärm Mé̄s 'Hit Icemewllo' Yä̌s Ga̋chī Gä̌sh Adlard</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Brun Castle has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Brun Castle receives an average of 141 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Brun Castle covers an area of nearly 97 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5114 m (16778 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Brun Castle was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1306, by Gärm Mé̄s 'Hit Icemewllo' Yä̌s Ga̋chī Gä̌sh Adlard. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Brun Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Brun Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Brun Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious paverstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Brun Castle's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Brun Castle's top tier civilian fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Brun Castle seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Brun Castle the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

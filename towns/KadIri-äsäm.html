<p>Kad Iri-äsäm (/iˈri/ /ɑˈsɑm/ [logical] [stool (seat)]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/VeláïkulkPrincipality.html">Veláïkulk Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tano.html">Tano</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Iri-äsäm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Iri-äsäm was founded by <a href="../people/Apogata2pp7pf3uyy.html">Apogata</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Iri-äsäm has a yearly average temperature of -2°C (29°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -25°C (-13°F). Kad Iri-äsäm receives an average of 204 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kad Iri-äsäm covers an area of nearly 78 km<sup>2</sup> (31 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2404 m (7887 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Iri-äsäm was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1521, by Apogata. The establishment of Kad Iri-äsäm was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Apogata struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Kad Iri-äsäm as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Kad Iri-äsäm was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Iri-äsäm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Kad Iri-äsäm is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive carved bedrock streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The city's robustly designed timber walls have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kad Iri-äsäm hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Kad Iri-äsäm might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Kad Iri-äsäm's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Kad Iri-äsäm it is impossible to directly or indirectly lie.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Soulsliver.html">Soulsliver</a> near Kad Iri-äsäm are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Kad Iri-äsäm was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kad Iri-äsäm lost 166 people, 143 livestock, and 89 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 91, when members of Kad Iri-äsäm's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Kad Iri-äsäm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kad Iri-äsäm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

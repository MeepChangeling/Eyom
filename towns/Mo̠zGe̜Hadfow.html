<p>Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow (/mo̠z/ /ge̜/ [basic] [irony]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Go̠wktōzi̽Parish.html">Go̠wktōzi̽ Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/VlekëkvluzDiocese.html">Vlekëkvluz Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Ublethsyl34mfa6q.html">Ubleth</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow receives an average of 149 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow covers an area of nearly 68 km<sup>2</sup> (27 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4908 m (16102 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1165, by Ubleth. The establishment of Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow's construction back out of the project. Ubleth pushed on reguardles, and Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow is was constructed arround several spacious flagstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>
<p>Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Mo̠z Ge̜ Hadfow there are no smells.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Mbe̜d-fton Larsme Hadfow was founded durring the late 11th century, by Knihl. The establishment of Mbe̜d-fton Larsme Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Knihl struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Mbe̜d-fton Larsme Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Mbe̜d-fton Larsme Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mbe̜d-fton Larsme Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mbe̜d-fton Larsme Hadfow is was constructed arround several spacious baked earthen mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Mbe̜d-fton Larsme Hadfow, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Mbe̜d-fton Larsme Hadfow seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

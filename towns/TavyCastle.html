<p>Tavy Castle (/ˈteɪvi/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BelnessDutchy.html">Belness Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/NueaKingdom.html">Nuea Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tavy Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tavy Castle was founded by <a href="../people/H́i̊thSugrueqfj1zfvzd2.html">H́i̊th Sugrue</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tavy Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Tavy Castle receives an average of 160 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Tavy Castle covers an area of nearly 133 km<sup>2</sup> (53 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5278 m (17316 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tavy Castle was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1519, by H́i̊th Sugrue. The establishment of Tavy Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Tavy Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tavy Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tavy Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Tavy Castle, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all preforming the same rituals to bless and anoint building,s streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holysymbols is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This city certainly loves its god.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Tavy Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Tavy Castle leaves and flower petals never touch the ground.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Mere Bellandur began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which brought great calamity to the entire nation, killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. The disaster brought an end to  people,  livestock, and  buildings. The disaster is referred to as the Grieving Wind.</p>

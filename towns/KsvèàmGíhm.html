<p>Ksvèàm Gíhm (Ksvè /əm/ [leisure] [buttocks; ass]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kririsi̊mùRegion.html">Kririsi̊mù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ksvèàm Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ksvèàm Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Êyênmsa8mnaigyf.html">Êyênm</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ksvèàm Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Ksvèàm Gíhm receives an average of 278 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ksvèàm Gíhm covers an area of nearly 165 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1608 m (5275 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ksvèàm Gíhm was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1327, by Êyênm. The establishment of Ksvèàm Gíhm suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Ksvèàm Gíhm which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Ksvèàm Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ksvèàm Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Ksvèàm Gíhm is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious packed earth streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Ksvèàm Gíhm's failry decent fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Ksvèàm Gíhm has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Ksvèàm Gíhm suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ksvèàm Gíhm long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ksvèàm Gíhm's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Ksvèàm Gíhm hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Ksvèàm Gíhm is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Ksvèàm Gíhm was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ksvèàm Gíhm lost 231 people, 277 livestock, and 41 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 98, when members of Ksvèàm Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Ksvèàm Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ksvèàm Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

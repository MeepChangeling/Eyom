<p>The name Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu was founded by <a href="../people/Faimes6gghkjib50.html">Faimes</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu was founded durring the late 17th century in late summer of the year 1582, by Faimes. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu is is constructed  arround a series of crampt gravel mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu's Ragnarock-era relics has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Slæ̈rn Vēkäti-glohutlu ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

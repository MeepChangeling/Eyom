<p>Odíhg Jàkēvan (/ʤəc/ /van/ [pea] [big; great (very large); massive; enormous]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/TsvíhiowCounty.html">Tsvíhiow County</a> of the <a href="../nations/PichamCommunity.html">Picham Community</a>.</p>
<p>The name Odíhg Jàkēvan is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Odíhg Jàkēvan was founded by <a href="../people/ShênmNanner3qsx6cg1h3.html">Shênm Nanner</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Odíhg Jàkēvan has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Odíhg Jàkēvan receives an average of 206 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Odíhg Jàkēvan covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 782 m (2565 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Odíhg Jàkēvan was founded durring the early 10th century, by Shênm Nanner. The establishment of Odíhg Jàkēvan suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Odíhg Jàkēvan was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Odíhg Jàkēvan is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Odíhg Jàkēvan is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town is protected by a humble stone fence which is tall enough to provide adiquite cover for defenders to fire from, but no more than that. The peasent-grade have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Odíhg Jàkēvan hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Odíhg Jàkēvan's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by order, symmetry, formal design, grandiosity, and elaborate ornamentation. Architectural characteristics include balustrades, balconies, columns, cornices, pilasters, and triangular pediments. Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. Interiors will often have a grand stairway and opulent ballroom..</p>
<p>In Odíhg Jàkēvan sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Odíhg Jàkēvan was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Odíhg Jàkēvan. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Odíhg Jàkēvan lost 129 people, 259 livestock, and 61 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 43, when members of Odíhg Jàkēvan's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about a particular port. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Odíhg Jàkēvan's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Odíhg Jàkēvan's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

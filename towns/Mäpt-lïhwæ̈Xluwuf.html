<p>Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf (/mɑpt/ /lɪˈhwæ̝/ [village; suburb] [wax]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GïtarejéPrincipality.html">Gïtarejé Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Nasdi.html">Nasdi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Treshêbeac1fvtdvti.html">Treshêbe</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 0°C (32°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 6°C (42°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -5°C (23°F). Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf receives an average of 243 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2200 m (7217 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1052, by Treshêbe. The establishment of Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Treshêbe electing to pay people to resettle in Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf.</p>
<p>Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf is buildings are built arround a single crampt paverstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf's cost-cutting-focused defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf's residents established a new industry 2 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Karnora Range, an iconic vista located neare Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf, proved to be volcanic when the range erupted. The eruption was isolated to the area around Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf, which was swallowed in ash, lava flows, and pyroclastic gasses. Mäpt-lïhwæ̈ Xluwuf lost 294 people, 378 livestock, and 81 buildings in the disaster. The event is forever remembered as the Day of Torment's Wrath.</p>

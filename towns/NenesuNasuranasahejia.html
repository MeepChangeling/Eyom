<p>Nenesu Nasuranasahejia (Nasura /ˌnasaˈheʤa/ [bead] [sleep]) is a temperate Town located in the <a href="../nations/expanse.html">expanse</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nenesu Nasuranasahejia is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nenesu Nasuranasahejia was founded by <a href="../people/QheingHoůh́atshuUserkhaure-SetepenrehuAmenemopetnisCleopatrarma50m70nk.html">Qheing Hoůh́ats hu Userkhaure-Setepenre hu Amenemopet nis Cleopatra </a>, who was culturaly Ancient.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Nenesu Nasuranasahejia covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 0 m (0 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nenesu Nasuranasahejia was founded durring the early 9th century, by Qheing Hoůh́ats hu Userkhaure-Setepenre hu Amenemopet nis Cleopatra . The establishment of Nenesu Nasuranasahejia suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Nenesu Nasuranasahejia was built using the conventions of Ancient durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nenesu Nasuranasahejia is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Nenesu Nasuranasahejia is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Nenesu Nasuranasahejia's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Nenesu Nasuranasahejia's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>

Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Life is hard in Nenesu Nasuranasahejia. Its people are impoverished compared to their peers elsewhere. Something is making the locals stay, however, whether fear of the alternative, hope for a better future, or a stubborn attachment to their ancestral lands. Whatver the reason, living in this harsh area for generations has made the people of Nenesu Nasuranasahejia a notably resourceful and hearty people.</p>
<p>Nenesu Nasuranasahejia's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Pond Chouteau began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which devastated , killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. An estimated  people,  livestock, and  buildings were lost to the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Hate Wind.</p>

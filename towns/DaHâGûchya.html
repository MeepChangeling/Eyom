<p>The name Da Hâ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Da Hâ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Glenniesxay4a2ya1.html">Glennie</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Da Hâ Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 11°C (51°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -2°C (29°F). Da Hâ Gûchya receives an average of 295 cm/y (116 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Da Hâ Gûchya covers an area of nearly 244 km<sup>2</sup> (97 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5366 m (17604 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Da Hâ Gûchya was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1286, by Glennie. The establishment of Da Hâ Gûchya  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Da Hâ Gûchya's construction back out of the project. Glennie pushed on reguardles, and Da Hâ Gûchya was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Da Hâ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Da Hâ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Da Hâ Gûchya is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Da Hâ Gûchya hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Da Hâ Gûchya was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Da Hâ Gûchya lost 185 people, 287 livestock, and 49 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 109, when members of Da Hâ Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to extract assets from a port under siege by the enemy. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with the defense of the port against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Da Hâ Gûchya's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Da Hâ Gûchya's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

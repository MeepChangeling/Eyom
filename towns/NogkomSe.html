<p>Nogkom Se (/nog/ /j̼ə/ [loss] [blue]) is a subtropical Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/Kririsi̊mùRegion.html">Kririsi̊mù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nogkom Se is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Nogkom Se was founded by <a href="../people/Zêyeg̈Owensnrgyh7ubyk.html">Zêyeg̈ Owens</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nogkom Se has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Nogkom Se receives an average of 183 cm/y (72 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Nogkom Se covers an area of nearly 7 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4630 m (15190 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nogkom Se was founded durring the early 17th century in early fall of the year 1623, by Zêyeg̈ Owens. The establishment of Nogkom Se suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Nogkom Se which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Nogkom Se was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nogkom Se is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Nogkom Se is buildings are located arround a single premissive packed earth mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the town a over all circular shape. The  town is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The exceptionaly well made fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Nogkom Se has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Nogkom Se ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Nogkom Se has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Nogkom Se. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Nogkom Se's parks.</p>

<p>Nogkom Se has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Nogkom Se's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Nogkom Se's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Nogkom Se the water is caffeinated.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Serpentfolk.html">Serpentfolk</a> near Nogkom Se are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Nogkom Se's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves sex to channel Conjuration energies of tier 2 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Nogkom Se is surrounded by dangerous terrain: miasmatic swamps, perilous crevasses, radioactive badlands, a pocket of or some other harmful topography. Nogkom Se might prefer the defensive potential of the terrain here, or have found a precious resource worth the danger. The terrain might have formed at some time since the founding, with the citizens struggling to make terms with the new danger.</p>
<p>Nogkom Se is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Nogkom Se was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nogkom Se lost 130 people, 225 livestock, and 68 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 83, when members of Nogkom Se's militia enacted an operation to train a group of civilians for a special clandestine operation. The operation was complicated by thick blankets of fog, which hid friend and foe alike. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the settlment, which ended in victory for Nogkom Se's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nogkom Se's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

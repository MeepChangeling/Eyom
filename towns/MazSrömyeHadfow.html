<p>The name Maz Srömye Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Maz Srömye Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Dyegênkajdpf33nqtg.html">Dyegênka</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Maz Srömye Hadfow was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1240, by Dyegênka. The establishment of Maz Srömye Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Dyegênka struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Maz Srömye Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Maz Srömye Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Maz Srömye Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Maz Srömye Hadfow is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive split-log ties mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Maz Srömye Hadfow, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Maz Srömye Hadfow is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Maz Srömye Hadfow lost 194 people, 223 livestock, and 72 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 39, when members of Maz Srömye Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to locate a particular prison.

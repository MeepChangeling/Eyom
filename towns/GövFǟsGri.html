<p>Göv Fǟs Gri (/go˞v/ /faːs/ [fast; smart; intelligent; quick] [apartment]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Kto̠lwawParish.html">Kto̠lwaw Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/Yi̽dvdroDiocese.html">Yi̽dvdro Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Göv Fǟs Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Göv Fǟs Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Puhumvolkxd2ykz0c.html">Puhumvo</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Göv Fǟs Gri has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Göv Fǟs Gri receives an average of 122 cm/y (48 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Göv Fǟs Gri covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3482 m (11423 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Göv Fǟs Gri was founded durring the late 17th century in early spring of the year 1574, by Puhumvo. The establishment of Göv Fǟs Gri was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Puhumvo struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Göv Fǟs Gri as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Göv Fǟs Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Göv Fǟs Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Göv Fǟs Gri is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious canals streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Göv Fǟs Gri, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Göv Fǟs Gri's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Göv Fǟs Gri is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Göv Fǟs Gri is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>Göv Fǟs Gri is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Göv Fǟs Gri was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Göv Fǟs Gri lost 176 people, 342 livestock, and 27 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 134, when members of Göv Fǟs Gri's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemyreligious figure. The operation was complicated by at least some of the intelligence related to the operation was incorrect. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the research site, which ended in a stalemate for Göv Fǟs Gri's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Göv Fǟs Gri's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

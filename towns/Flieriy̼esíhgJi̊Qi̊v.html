<p>Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v (Flieriy̼ /ˈesɪ̞g/ [treason] [discussion]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/PesutkrakodaRegion.html">Pesutkrakoda Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Èdshèbëmh5a4jh2lva.html">Èdshèbëm</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 176 cm/y (69 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 223 km<sup>2</sup> (89 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7690 m (-17720 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1248, by Èdshèbëm. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

<p>While Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders.

<p>Flieriy̼esíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

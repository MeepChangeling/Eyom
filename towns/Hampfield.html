<p>The name Hampfield is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hampfield was founded by <a href="../people/ZlèsêvGristzy08gkgkxr.html">Zlèsêv Grist</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hampfield has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Hampfield receives an average of 142 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Hampfield covers an area of nearly 418 km<sup>2</sup> (167 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2466 m (8090 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hampfield was founded durring the early 17th century in early spring of the year 1603, by Zlèsêv Grist. The establishment of Hampfield was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Zlèsêv Grist electing to pay people to resettle in Hampfield.</p>
<p>Hampfield was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hampfield is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hampfield is buildings are arranged within a network of broad packed earth streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Hampfield, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Hampfield has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Hampfield’s streets.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Hampfield's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Hampfield rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Raven.html">Raven</a> near Hampfield are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Hampfield's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves consuming a local narcotic to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 2 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Hampfield is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> spared the town from an attack. Hampfield created a local delicacy in 's honor which is served at festivals.</p>

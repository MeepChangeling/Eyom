<p>The name Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz was founded by <a href="../people/Shënhê3bh4fd3hl0.html">Shënhê</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz receives an average of 238 cm/y (93 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3268 m (10721 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1271, by Shënhê. The establishment of Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz's construction back out of the project. Shënhê pushed on reguardles, and Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz is buildings are located arround a single premissive packed earth mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz is like a look into a broken heart which long ago fell to corruption. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need… unless of course, they would be an easy target for some robbery. The city has truly fallen to evil.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz lost 251 people, 231 livestock, and 63 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 163, when members of Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Qÿhtvehb Yåla Gåz's forces.

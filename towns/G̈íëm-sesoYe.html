<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye (/ɘˈnije/ /ˈseso/ [intimate] [stomach; gut; belly]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KymelethCounty.html">Kymeleth County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name G̈íëm-seso Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as G̈íëm-seso Ye was founded by Laerguldes, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). G̈íëm-seso Ye receives an average of 279 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. G̈íëm-seso Ye covers an area of nearly 271 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1658 m (5439 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1505, by Laerguldes. The establishment of G̈íëm-seso Ye was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Laerguldes electing to pay people to resettle in G̈íëm-seso Ye.</p>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and G̈íëm-seso Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye is is constructed  arround a series of crampt cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The cliffside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround G̈íëm-seso Ye, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around G̈íëm-seso Ye shows G̈íëm-seso Ye as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear G̈íëm-seso Ye places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items.

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for G̈íëm-seso Ye's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye is home to a distinct subculture, who are either the majority here or have the dominant positions in the community. Architecture, local laws, and social customs are all tuned to suit them, and they may not be particularly forgiving or friendly to the major culture of the region. Communities that are not outright independent usually make an arm's-length submission to a local lord.</p>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is long in G̈íëm-seso Ye.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Boggard.html">Boggard</a> near G̈íëm-seso Ye are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>G̈íëm-seso Ye's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves sex to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 2 via mimery.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

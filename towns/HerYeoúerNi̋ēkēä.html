<p>The name Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/ZèbêjZlëdGrèGreatForestCentipedesLeopardSlugs1q8aqc0it4.html">Zèbêj Zlëd Grè Great Forest Centipedes Leopard Slugs</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 255 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 120 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2442 m (8011 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1538, by Zèbêj Zlëd Grè Great Forest Centipedes Leopard Slugs. The establishment of Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Zèbêj Zlëd Grè Great Forest Centipedes Leopard Slugs electing to pay people to resettle in Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä.</p>
<p>Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are speckled and packed arround broad paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>In Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä lost 135 people, 192 livestock, and 95 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 85, when members of Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to train a group of civilians for a special clandestine operation. The operation was complicated by at least some of the intelligence related to the operation was incorrect. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in victory for Her Yeoúer Ni̋ēkēä's forces.

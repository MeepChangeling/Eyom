The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Sdäglip-fokwa Xluwuf is buildings are built arround a single spacious cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape.

While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Unfortuantly, these unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>

<p>Sdäglip-fokwa Xluwuf has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Sdäglip-fokwa Xluwuf was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Sdäglip-fokwa Xluwuf lost 293 people, 324 livestock, and 84 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 76, when members of Sdäglip-fokwa Xluwuf's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy expert. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the bridge, which ended in a crushing defeat for Sdäglip-fokwa Xluwuf's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Sdäglip-fokwa Xluwuf's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

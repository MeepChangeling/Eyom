<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri (/e̜/ /haː/ [long] [face; forehead; brow; side; expression; character; facade; surface]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/Strömo̠wMoot.html">Strömo̠w Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name E̜ Hǟ Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as E̜ Hǟ Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Morguleth1dq90d288c.html">Morguleth</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant -11°C (13°F). E̜ Hǟ Gri receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. E̜ Hǟ Gri covers an area of nearly 41 km<sup>2</sup> (16 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3186 m (10452 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1448, by Morguleth. The establishment of E̜ Hǟ Gri was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Morguleth electing to pay people to resettle in E̜ Hǟ Gri.</p>
<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and E̜ Hǟ Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri is buildings are located arround a single premissive packed earth mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of E̜ Hǟ Gri weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The budget focused millitary grade defenses have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled E̜ Hǟ Gri ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for E̜ Hǟ Gri's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In E̜ Hǟ Gri it is impossible to directly or indirectly lie.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Zoog.html">Zoog</a> near E̜ Hǟ Gri are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves drinking to channel Mysticism energies of tier 3 via mimery.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>E̜ Hǟ Gri used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 4 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century heavy spring rains following an uncharacteristically dry year and a minor earthquake resulted in the collapse of the south east slope of Ajusco Mountain. the landslide struck E̜ Hǟ Gri, and devastated the community. 146 people, 113 livestock, and 62 buildings were lost to the calamity. The disaster is recorded in history as Loss's Fall.</p>

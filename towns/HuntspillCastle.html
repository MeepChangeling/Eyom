<p>Huntspill Castle (/huntspill/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/AldwynneDutchy.html">Aldwynne Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/NiuohiewanKingdom.html">Niuohiewan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Huntspill Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Huntspill Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Zeg̈kêLetlowrafptkvzd5.html">Zeg̈kê Letlow</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Huntspill Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F). Huntspill Castle receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Huntspill Castle covers an area of nearly 208 km<sup>2</sup> (83 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3320 m (10892 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Huntspill Castle was founded durring the late 16th century in winter of the year 1471, by Zeg̈kê Letlow. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Zeg̈kê Letlow.</p>
<p>Huntspill Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Huntspill Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Huntspill Castle is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Huntspill Castle's millitarily questionable fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Huntspill Castle has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Huntspill Castle ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>

While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>

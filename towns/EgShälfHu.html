<p>The name Eg Shälf Hu is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Eg Shälf Hu was founded by <a href="../people/Bë̌sJó̄̋AuraRickyNīki̋nḱCú̄ńMp̪féchPhodnezerfm2witay284.html">Bë̌s Jó̄̋ 'Aura Ricky' Nīki̋nḱ Cú̄ń Mp̪féch Phodnezerf</a>, who was culturaly Dwarvern.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Eg Shälf Hu receives an average of 260 cm/y (102 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Eg Shälf Hu covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 806 m (2644 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1321, by Bë̌s Jó̄̋ 'Aura Ricky' Nīki̋nḱ Cú̄ń Mp̪féch Phodnezerf. The establishment of Eg Shälf Hu suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Eg Shälf Hu which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Eg Shälf Hu is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive paverstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a town of Eg Shälf Hu's size could have. The well-designed, yet cheep have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Eg Shälf Hu seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Eg Shälf Hu. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Eg Shälf Hu's parks.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Eg Shälf Hu.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has a government-funded child care program, overseen by the local Department of Nursemaids, which is responsible for providing childcare to working-class citizens according to local ordinances.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has a Department of Firefighters, which is responsible for organizing fire fighting efforts during a fire and enforcing local ordinances relating to fire safety.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Eg Shälf Hu's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Eg Shälf Hu's grid is powered by an arcane means.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Eg Shälf Hu's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Eg Shälf Hu.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Boar.html">Boar</a> near Eg Shälf Hu are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Eg Shälf Hu’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Eg Shälf Hu’s streets.</p>
<p>Eg Shälf Hu's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Eg Shälf Hu was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Eg Shälf Hu lost 232 people, 329 livestock, and 76 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 225, when members of Eg Shälf Hu's militia enacted an operation to gain control of a particular depot. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with the defense of the depot against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Eg Shälf Hu's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Eg Shälf Hu's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

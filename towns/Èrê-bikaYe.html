<p>Èrê-bika Ye (/ˈèrɘ/ /ˈbika/ [bizarre] [folder]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/UlnoreCounty.html">Ulnore County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Èrê-bika Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Èrê-bika Ye was founded by Zelêb, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Èrê-bika Ye has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Èrê-bika Ye receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Èrê-bika Ye covers an area of nearly 275 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3854 m (12644 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Èrê-bika Ye was founded durring the late 11th century, by Zelêb. The establishment of Èrê-bika Ye suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Èrê-bika Ye which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Èrê-bika Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Èrê-bika Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Èrê-bika Ye is buildings are arranged arround a single restrictive gravel mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The lakeside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Èrê-bika Ye, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Èrê-bika Ye is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Èrê-bika Ye possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Èrê-bika Ye has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<p>Èrê-bika Ye is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Èrê-bika Ye's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>
<p>In Èrê-bika Ye rainbows form quite often above the Large City.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Mole.html">Mole</a> near Èrê-bika Ye are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Èrê-bika Ye's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves bloodletting to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 3 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Qi̘v Sonàj̼ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Sonàj̼ was founded by Mocthel Pughan Cadward, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Sonàj̼ has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Qi̘v Sonàj̼ receives an average of 278 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Sonàj̼ was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1524, by Mocthel Pughan Cadward. The establishment of Qi̘v Sonàj̼ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Mocthel Pughan Cadward struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qi̘v Sonàj̼ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Sonàj̼ was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Sonàj̼ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Sonàj̼ is is constructed  arround a series of crampt paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The mountain city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The perhapse unnessisarily well built defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Qi̘v Sonàj̼ gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Sonàj̼ has access to some sort of functioning ancient infrastructure, whether it's an array of wall-mounted arcane energy projectors, running water, moving roadways, community-wide climate control, or some other inherited luxury. This infrastructure may be the result of a still-functional Working, or it could be the product of some venerable occult engine that's still operational, or it may be the fruit of the labors of some specially-designed organism or Blighted populace.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Sonàj̼'s roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Qi̘v Sonàj̼ suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<p>Driyāzèkwa Gíhm (Driyā /ˈzɛkwa/ [charcoal; fuel] [silence]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/VātuchàjùRegion.html">Vātuchàjù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Driyāzèkwa Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Driyāzèkwa Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Amphilinaev6x41v58pc.html">Amphilinae</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Driyāzèkwa Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Driyāzèkwa Gíhm receives an average of 256 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Driyāzèkwa Gíhm covers an area of nearly 189 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3446 m (11305 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Driyāzèkwa Gíhm was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1078, by Amphilinae. The establishment of Driyāzèkwa Gíhm  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Driyāzèkwa Gíhm's construction back out of the project. Amphilinae pushed on reguardles, and Driyāzèkwa Gíhm was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Driyāzèkwa Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Driyāzèkwa Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature stone brick construction with most buildings posessing towers, turrets, dormers, and wide wrap-around porches. An extreem emphasis on decorative features and emblishments can be seen even on the poorest of homes and makes even the most humble of structures seem a bit regal.</p>
<p>Driyāzèkwa Gíhm is is constructed arround a semi-circular premissive split-log ties mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Driyāzèkwa Gíhm's exceptionaly well made fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Driyāzèkwa Gíhm is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. There’s a patern to the panic. It’s not easy to see, and no one quite agrees on what it is, but the locals know and operate under this pattern. It shapes everything they do, and you feel as if you’ve almost worked it out only for some small detail to devastate your theory every time you try and comprehend it.</p>

<p>Driyāzèkwa Gíhm's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

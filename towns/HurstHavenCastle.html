<p>Hurst Haven Castle was founded durring the early 11th century, by H́iynů Bradford. The establishment of Hurst Haven Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Hurst Haven Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Hurst Haven Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hurst Haven Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Hurst Haven Castle is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Hurst Haven Castle's Ragnarock-era relics has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 2 years has greatly spiked Hurst Haven Castle's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami spared the town from an attack. One of Hurst Haven Castle's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

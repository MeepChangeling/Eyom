<p>The name Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Tshêbëmqjlhkl8zx.html">Tshêbë</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê covers an area of nearly 216 km<sup>2</sup> (86 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1026 m (3366 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1191, by Tshêbë. The establishment of Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Tshêbë electing to pay people to resettle in Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê.</p>
<p>Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê is buildings have been located at convienant points along the valley Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the premissive packed earth streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these brittle defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Gezyan-qêmi Jinèna Ratê has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>

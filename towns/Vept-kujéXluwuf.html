<p>Vept-kujé Xluwuf (/vept/ /cujj/ [huge] [candy; vagina (slang)]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SlïrddámsPrincipality.html">Slïrddáms Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Cochi.html">Cochi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vept-kujé Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Vept-kujé Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Nendesqr3xahsq7a.html">Nendes</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vept-kujé Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 6°C (42°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 14°C (57°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Vept-kujé Xluwuf receives an average of 208 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Vept-kujé Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 232 km<sup>2</sup> (92 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3222 m (10570 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vept-kujé Xluwuf was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1545, by Nendes. The establishment of Vept-kujé Xluwuf suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Vept-kujé Xluwuf which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Vept-kujé Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vept-kujé Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Vept-kujé Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad canals streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Vept-kujé Xluwuf's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Vept-kujé Xluwuf's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Vept-kujé Xluwuf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Vept-kujé Xluwuf is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Vept-kujé Xluwuf might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Vept-kujé Xluwuf's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>In Vept-kujé Xluwuf tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>

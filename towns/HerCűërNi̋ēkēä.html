<p>Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä (/hɜ̋ː/ /kʌ̋ɜː/ [physical; tangible] [moment]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BāwkyoīäProvence.html">Bāwkyoīä Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/KhnegmasDheinguSnagiav3nfcu31l.html">Khnegmas Dheingu Snagi</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 272 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 54 km<sup>2</sup> (21 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2398 m (7867 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 11th century, by Khnegmas Dheingu Snagi. The establishment of Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä's budget focused millitary grade defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä lost 165 people, 190 livestock, and 62 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 183, when members of Her Cűër Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to capture a specific enemy  spy alive. The operation was complicated by the enemy forces had far more numbers than estimated.

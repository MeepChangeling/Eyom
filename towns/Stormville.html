<p>Stormville (/stɔːm/ /ville/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a tropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SpellvioletDutchy.html">Spellviolet Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/ShoverleyCounty.html">Shoverley County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Stormville is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Stormville was founded by Tselêd Barnfather, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Stormville has a yearly average temperature of 34°C (93°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 39°C (102°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 30°C (86°F). Stormville receives an average of 68 cm/y (26 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Stormville covers an area of nearly 315 km<sup>2</sup> (126 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 17096 m (13139 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Stormville was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1183, by Tselêd Barnfather. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Tselêd Barnfather.</p>
<p>Stormville was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Stormville is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Stormville is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Stormville's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Stormville's top tier civilian fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Stormville gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Stormville has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Stormville's residents established a new industry (17084 % 6)+1 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Stormville was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Stormville lost 164 people, 177 livestock, and 98 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 198, when members of Stormville's militia enacted an operation to destroy or capture a specific enemy  expert. The operation was complicated by extremely dangerous terrain, including unfamiliar and poisonous plants which many ate while foraging. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a crushing defeat for Stormville's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Stormville's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

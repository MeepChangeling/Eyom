<p>Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh (/s̼ɪ̘tˈtro/ /həd/ [amber] [star; celebrity]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/EvwåschyothäbProvence.html">Evwåschyothäb Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/HollyHeadley4zh5jtf9a3.html">Holly Headley</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh receives an average of 243 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh covers an area of nearly 252 km<sup>2</sup> (100 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 9674 m (-11210 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1417, by Holly Headley. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Holly Headley.</p>
<p>Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are located arround a single premissive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\HerdAnimalStag.html">Herd Animal, Stag</a> near Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Chehttro Häd Ÿhkphÿh's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves line dance to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 1 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

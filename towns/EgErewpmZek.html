<p>Eg Erewpm Zek (/eˈruːpm/ /zek/ [wild] [block; cube]) is a subtropical Large Town located in <a href="../subprovences/ÎtëvîtafiCounty.html">Îtëvîtafi County</a>, <a href="../provences/QånehgdabKingdom.html">Qånehgdab Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/UnitedKingdomofUndermountain.html">United Kingdom of Undermountain</a>.</p>
<p>The name Eg Erewpm Zek is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Eg Erewpm Zek was founded by <a href="../people/CeriHärtedraydxft3qrilss.html">Ceri Härtedrayd</a>, who was culturaly Dwarvern.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Eg Erewpm Zek has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Eg Erewpm Zek receives an average of 268 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Eg Erewpm Zek covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2368 m (7769 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Eg Erewpm Zek was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1357, by Ceri Härtedrayd. The establishment of Eg Erewpm Zek suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Eg Erewpm Zek was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Eg Erewpm Zek is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Eg Erewpm Zek is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  town posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Eg Erewpm Zek weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Astonishigly, the budget focused millitary grade defenses are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Eg Erewpm Zek is like a look into a broken heart which long ago fell to corruption. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need… unless of course, they would be an easy target for some robbery. The town has truly fallen to evil.</p>

<p>Eg Erewpm Zek has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Eg Erewpm Zek.

<p>Eg Erewpm Zek has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Eg Erewpm Zek's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Eg Erewpm Zek has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>

<p>Eg Erewpm Zek's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves performance art to channel Necromancy energies of tier 2 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Eg Erewpm Zek is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Eg Erewpm Zek is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Eg Erewpm Zek was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Eg Erewpm Zek. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Eg Erewpm Zek lost 154 people, 240 livestock, and 62 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 178, when members of Eg Erewpm Zek's militia enacted an operation to train a specific irregulars group for an upcoming operation. The operation was complicated by a natural disaster interrupted the operation, shattering unit cohesion. The conflict ended with the defense of the bridge against a siege, which ended in defeat for Eg Erewpm Zek's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Eg Erewpm Zek's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

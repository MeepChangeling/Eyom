<p>Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä (/bɔ̄ːk/ /ɹǣɜː/ [sudden; abrupt; swift] [foam]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GīmōthyǎvyRegion.html">Gīmōthyǎvy Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/HahrurthIsiaGrovgezb81f4cc43u.html">Hahrurth Isia Grovgez</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 1°C (33°F). Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 294 cm/y (115 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 207 km<sup>2</sup> (82 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2748 m (9015 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 18th century in late winter of the year 1681, by Hahrurth Isia Grovgez. The establishment of Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä's construction back out of the project. Hahrurth Isia Grovgez pushed on reguardles, and Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä is was constructed arround several restrictive cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä's millitarily questionable fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä was attacked by savage cyclopss living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä lost 204 people, 130 livestock, and 57 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 43, when members of Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to a  hero, then secure them. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Seówm Rē̄r Ni̋ēkēä's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä (/zɑ̌kʊ́æ/ /ɹʊ/ [unit] [Penis fencing]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/JǎlēyeēyRegion.html">Jǎlēyeēy Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/TsêjKhèsîTrèsêjfgd52wmihh.html">Tsêj Khèsî Trèsêj</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 300 cm/y (118 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 139 km<sup>2</sup> (55 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3282 m (10767 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1337, by Tsêj Khèsî Trèsêj. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Tsêj Khèsî Trèsêj.</p>
<p>Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow packed earth streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä all of the cats speak the local language with prefect diction.</p>

<p>Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves line dance to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 1 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Zūtḩ Rō Ni̋ēkēä is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>

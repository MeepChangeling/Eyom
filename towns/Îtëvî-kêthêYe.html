<p>Îtëvî-kêthê Ye (/ɪˈtëvɪ/ /ˈkɘʃɘ/ [painful] [rate]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SshaumerilelCounty.html">Sshaumerilel County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Îtëvî-kêthê Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Îtëvî-kêthê Ye was founded by Tsilî, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Îtëvî-kêthê Ye has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Îtëvî-kêthê Ye receives an average of 295 cm/y (116 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Îtëvî-kêthê Ye covers an area of nearly 274 km<sup>2</sup> (109 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5720 m (18766 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Îtëvî-kêthê Ye was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1252, by Tsilî. The establishment of Îtëvî-kêthê Ye was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tsilî struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Îtëvî-kêthê Ye as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Îtëvî-kêthê Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Îtëvî-kêthê Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Îtëvî-kêthê Ye is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive worn bedrock mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The riverside city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Îtëvî-kêthê Ye's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Îtëvî-kêthê Ye's budget oriented are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Îtëvî-kêthê Ye is like looking into a university’s plaza on the day before an exam. People rush about to-and-fro. Discarded scrolls and quills are dotted around  city. In spite of many locals discussing academic topics, there’s little sign of any organized groups for any of that talk. Infact, the city seems disordered in general with everything scattered helter skelter about.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Îtëvî-kêthê Ye was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Îtëvî-kêthê Ye. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Îtëvî-kêthê Ye lost 134 people, 287 livestock, and 33 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 184, when members of Îtëvî-kêthê Ye's militia enacted an operation to locate a specific  mage. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the depot, which ended in defeat for Îtëvî-kêthê Ye's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Îtëvî-kêthê Ye's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>The name Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Tshelîmv3ml8fc0nw.html">Tshelîm</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf was founded durring the early 9th century, by Tshelîm. The establishment of Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf's construction back out of the project. Tshelîm pushed on reguardles, and Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt cobblestone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Ipimu-lárdem Xluwuf weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>

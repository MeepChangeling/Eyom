<p>Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw (/nji/ /slaw/ [good; hot (attractive); fine (okay); great (excellent)] [scarf]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/TákzráPrincipality.html">Tákzrá Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tano.html">Tano</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw was founded by <a href="../people/Tshêyêgës9ydjq0nl0.html">Tshêyêgë</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw has a yearly average temperature of 3°C (37°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 6°C (42°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 1°C (33°F). Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw receives an average of 206 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw covers an area of nearly 121 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2638 m (8654 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1338, by Tshêyêgë. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Tshêyêgë electing to pay people to resettle in Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt flagstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\CobraFlower.html">Cobra Flower</a> near Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Mysticism energies of tier 1 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami ended a drought plaguing Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw. One of Slæ̈rn Nji-slaw's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<p>Slæ̈rn E-mänd (/e/ /mæ̝nd/ [other; spare] [lava]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SlïrddámsPrincipality.html">Slïrddáms Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Cochi.html">Cochi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn E-mänd is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn E-mänd was founded by <a href="../people/Shurthahi6v1z72v42.html">Shurthah</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn E-mänd has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 7°C (44°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Slæ̈rn E-mänd receives an average of 227 cm/y (89 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Slæ̈rn E-mänd covers an area of nearly 189 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2752 m (9028 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn E-mänd was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1463, by Shurthah. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Shurthah.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn E-mänd was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn E-mänd is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn E-mänd is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow baked earthen streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The perhapse unnessisarily well built defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn E-mänd has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Slæ̈rn E-mänd ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Slæ̈rn E-mänd is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Slæ̈rn E-mänd long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Slæ̈rn E-mänd which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn E-mänd's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is long in Slæ̈rn E-mänd.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Slæ̈rn E-mänd was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Slæ̈rn E-mänd lost 140 people, 371 livestock, and 86 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 164, when members of Slæ̈rn E-mänd's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Slæ̈rn E-mänd's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Slæ̈rn E-mänd's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri (/tit/ /ˈtjalfo̠m/ [precious; rare] [cove]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Gde̜ngwatyodMoot.html">Gde̜ngwatyod Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Mlëit993msij0q.html">Mlëi</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri has a yearly average temperature of 6°C (42°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -13°C (9°F). Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri receives an average of 307 cm/y (120 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri covers an area of nearly 207 km<sup>2</sup> (82 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3742 m (12276 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri was founded durring the early 19th century in late fall of the year 1807, by Mlëi. The establishment of Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Mlëi struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 19th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri’s streets. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as relaxing. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p>Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri is still bloodied by a recent violent conflict. A crushing bandit raid, a lost siege, getting caught at the periphery of a major battle, or some other calamity has inflicted severe damage on the place. Some communities may suffer a longer-term version of this, their youths lost in a grinding, endless battle against some perpetual threat.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century heavy spring rains following an uncharacteristically dry year and a minor earthquake resulted in the collapse of the north slope of Crestone Mountain. the landslide struck Tit Tyalfo̠m Gri, and devastated the community. 285 people, 365 livestock, and 78 buildings were lost to the calamity. The disaster is recorded in history as Terror's Fall.</p>

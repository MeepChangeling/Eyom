<p>The name Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Trîyèlëml68fv4f3ja.html">Trîyèlëm</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1128, by Trîyèlëm. The establishment of Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya's construction back out of the project. Trîyèlëm pushed on reguardles, and Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya is buildings are speckled and packed arround premissive gravel streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Qilû Qàchyà Gûchya.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

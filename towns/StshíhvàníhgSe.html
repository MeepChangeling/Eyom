<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se (Stshíh /ˈvənɪ̞g/ [cell (room in a prison)] [sailor]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/HoylånlyeHold.html">Hoylånlye Hold</a>, <a href="../provences/Fidhi̊siProvence.html">Fidhi̊si Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Stshíhvàníhg Se is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Stshíhvàníhg Se was founded by <a href="../people/GlkdsíLowcockGoiē̼o91fztw06nh.html">Glkdsí Lowcock Goiē̼o</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Stshíhvàníhg Se receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Stshíhvàníhg Se covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7720 m (-17621 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1135, by Glkdsí Lowcock Goiē̼o. The establishment of Stshíhvàníhg Se suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Stshíhvàníhg Se which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Stshíhvàníhg Se is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature stone brick construction with most buildings posessing towers, turrets, dormers, and wide wrap-around porches. An extreem emphasis on decorative features and emblishments can be seen even on the poorest of homes and makes even the most humble of structures seem a bit regal.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Stshíhvàníhg Se was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive canals streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Stshíhvàníhg Se's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The political statment focused walls has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Stshíhvàníhg Se has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Stshíhvàníhg Se long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Stshíhvàníhg Se. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Stshíhvàníhg Se's parks.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Stshíhvàníhg Se.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Stshíhvàníhg Se's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Stshíhvàníhg Se's grid is powered by an arcane means.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Stshíhvàníhg Se's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Stshíhvàníhg Se.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿CloudDragonWyrmling.html">﻿Cloud Dragon, Wyrmling</a> near Stshíhvàníhg Se are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves bloodletting to channel Transmutation energies of tier 2 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Stshíhvàníhg Se's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Stshíhvàníhg Se suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Stshíhvàníhg Se was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Stshíhvàníhg Se lost 203 people, 248 livestock, and 45 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 192, when members of Stshíhvàníhg Se's militia enacted an operation to fortify a particular production site. The operation was complicated by at least some of the intelligence related to the operation was incorrect. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the production site, which ended in defeat for Stshíhvàníhg Se's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Stshíhvàníhg Se's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

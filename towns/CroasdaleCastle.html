<p>Croasdale Castle (/croasdale/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/VioletwaterDutchy.html">Violetwater Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/YehanKingdom.html">Yehan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Croasdale Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Croasdale Castle was founded by <a href="../people/BrèbèHampav5r4mhv2.html">Brèbè Ham</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Croasdale Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F).

Croasdale Castle covers an area of nearly 146 km<sup>2</sup> (58 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5774 m (18943 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Croasdale Castle was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1171, by Brèbè Ham. The establishment of Croasdale Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Croasdale Castle's construction back out of the project. Brèbè Ham pushed on reguardles, and Croasdale Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Croasdale Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Croasdale Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Croasdale Castle is buildings are located arround a single spacious baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Croasdale Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Croasdale Castle makes you wonder how anything ever gets done. The locals have clear, obvious rivalries with one another, as seen through clenched teeth and fake smiles. What’s more, there is a serious lack of any organization and planning in Croasdale Castle’s layout as well as the local’s behaviors. The city seems to be a den of chaos where tongues are forked and local customs do not exist.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Croasdale Castle used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 6 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Croasdale Castle was struck by an anomalously harsh winter storm which brought extreme cold and deep snows along with its blustering winds. The worst of the disaster struck The storm coated everything in a thick layer of ice and freezing countless animals, plants, and people to death. Croasdale Castle lost 168 people, and 352 livestock in the disaster.. The disaster is remembered as the Mourning Screams, after the sounds of the winds.</p>

<p>Slæ̈rn Law-fämf (/law/ /fæ̝mf/ [casual] [priority]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SlïrddámsPrincipality.html">Slïrddáms Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Cochi.html">Cochi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn Law-fämf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Law-fämf was founded by <a href="../people/Khemneanddfb9dufnk.html">Khemnean</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-fämf has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 13°C (55°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -4°C (25°F). Slæ̈rn Law-fämf receives an average of 242 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the long winter months. Slæ̈rn Law-fämf covers an area of nearly 103 km<sup>2</sup> (41 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3442 m (11292 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-fämf was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1196, by Khemnean. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-fämf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Law-fämf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-fämf is buildings are speckled and packed arround premissive packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Slæ̈rn Law-fämf's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Slæ̈rn Law-fämf's political statment focused walls are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Slæ̈rn Law-fämf is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>

<p>Slæ̈rn Law-fämf's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Slæ̈rn Law-fämf sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Slæ̈rn Law-fämf’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Slæ̈rn Law-fämf’s streets.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-fämf's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> protected Slæ̈rn Law-fämf's harvest from an army of bandits.  was immortalized in song for this deed.</p>

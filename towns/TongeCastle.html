<p>Tonge Castle (/tɑnʤ/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tonge Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tonge Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ShonkdshPostlethwaitejj2cbprqcj.html">Shonkdsh Postlethwaite</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tonge Castle has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Tonge Castle receives an average of 277 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Tonge Castle covers an area of nearly 63 km<sup>2</sup> (25 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3204 m (10511 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tonge Castle was founded durring the late 20th century in early summer of the year 1968, by Shonkdsh Postlethwaite. The establishment of Tonge Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Tonge Castle's construction back out of the project. Shonkdsh Postlethwaite pushed on reguardles, and Tonge Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Tonge Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 20th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tonge Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tonge Castle is buildings have been located at convienant points along the pond Tonge Castle was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the premissive flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these cost-cutting-focused defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Tonge Castle gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Tonge Castle brings to mind.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Joūn My Gaw̋lē was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1290, by Mp̪vēshī Joīkīkī 'Deific Hit' Cā́chvō̋ Béōy Ha̋mpf̄ Mbóń̄ Gō̄shī. The establishment of Joūn My Gaw̋lē suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Joūn My Gaw̋lē which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Joūn My Gaw̋lē was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Joūn My Gaw̋lē is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Joūn My Gaw̋lē is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious flagstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The city's exceptionaly well made fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Joūn My Gaw̋lē has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Joūn My Gaw̋lē long.</p>

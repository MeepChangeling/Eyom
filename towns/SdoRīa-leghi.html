<p>Sdo Rīa-leghi ([root words not on file] [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Metropolis located in the <a href="../provences/AtonkasGovernorate.html">Atonkas Governorate</a> of the <a href="../nations/KoiapianCity-state.html">Koiapian City-state</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sdo Rīa-leghi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Sdo Rīa-leghi was founded by Zlkèbm Derrick, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sdo Rīa-leghi has a yearly average temperature of 0°C (32°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant -25°C (-13°F). Sdo Rīa-leghi receives an average of 255 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Sdo Rīa-leghi covers an area of nearly 210 km<sup>2</sup> (84 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2460 m (8070 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sdo Rīa-leghi was founded durring the early 11th century, by Zlkèbm Derrick. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Zlkèbm Derrick.</p>
<p>Sdo Rīa-leghi was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sdo Rīa-leghi is no diffrent. The metropolis's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Sdo Rīa-leghi is buildings are located arround a single crampt baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the metropolis a over all circular shape. The mountain metropolis rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Sdo Rīa-leghi's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Unfortuantly, these political statment focused walls are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Sdo Rīa-leghi has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Sdo Rīa-leghi’s streets. A look around Sdo Rīa-leghi has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Sdo Rīa-leghi long.</p>

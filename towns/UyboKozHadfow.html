<p>The name Uybo Koz Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Uybo Koz Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Tsèsêmc2at47vf45.html">Tsèsêm</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Uybo Koz Hadfow was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1089, by Tsèsêm. The establishment of Uybo Koz Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tsèsêm struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Uybo Koz Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Uybo Koz Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Uybo Koz Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Uybo Koz Hadfow is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive packed earth streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Uybo Koz Hadfow weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Uybo Koz Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Uybo Koz Hadfow long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Uybo Koz Hadfow's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Uybo Koz Hadfow hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

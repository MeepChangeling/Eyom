<p>The name Rirû Lûqa Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Rirû Lûqa Mudâ was founded by Shegëm, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rirû Lûqa Mudâ was founded durring the early 10th century, by Shegëm. The establishment of Rirû Lûqa Mudâ suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Rirû Lûqa Mudâ which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Rirû Lûqa Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rirû Lûqa Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Rirû Lûqa Mudâ is buildings are arranged within a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The lakeside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Rirû Lûqa Mudâ, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Rirû Lûqa Mudâ's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Rirû Lûqa Mudâ there are no smells.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v (/soj̼/ /qom/ [total; sum; score; amount; profit] [awful; terrible]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ZåkräfRegion.html">Zåkräf Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/CrabSwarms68sjbxxu93.html">Crab Swarms</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 176 cm/y (69 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4248 m (13937 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 11th century, by Crab Swarms. The establishment of Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Crab Swarms electing to pay people to resettle in Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>
<p>Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. There’s a patern to the panic. It’s not easy to see, and no one quite agrees on what it is, but the locals know and operate under this pattern. It shapes everything they do, and you feel as if you’ve almost worked it out only for some small detail to devastate your theory every time you try and comprehend it.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 1 years has greatly spiked Soy̼qom Ji̊ Qi̊v's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>

<p>Congridge (/congridge/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/SilverfalconDutchy.html">Silverfalcon Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/SifateKingdom.html">Sifate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Congridge is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Congridge was founded by <a href="../people/GlèshêShermanStilleyv7zfbax9p8.html">Glèshê Sherman Stilley</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Congridge has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Congridge receives an average of 142 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Congridge covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2970 m (9744 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Congridge was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1304, by Glèshê Sherman Stilley. The establishment of Congridge  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Congridge's construction back out of the project. Glèshê Sherman Stilley pushed on reguardles, and Congridge was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Congridge was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Congridge is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Congridge is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious canals streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Congridge weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The town's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Congridge has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Congridge ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Congridge as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the town brings to mind.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Congridge has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Congridge.</p>
<p>Congridge has a government-funded child care program, overseen by the local Department of Nursemaids, which is responsible for providing childcare to working-class citizens according to local ordinances.</p>
<p>Congridge has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Congridge has a Guild of Nurses, which is tasked with caring for the elderly and infirm in accordance with local ordinances, religious values, and customs.</p>
<p>Congridge has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Congridge has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Congridge's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Congridge has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.</p>

<p>Congridge has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Congridge, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Congridge's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used which employed abundant symbolic geometry, using pure forms such as the circle and square, and plans are based on often symmetrical layouts featuring rectangular courtyards and halls. These structures were is decorated with carved stone or stucco reliefs and made use of colorful stone mosaics..</p>
<p>In Congridge every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Raven.html">Raven</a> near Congridge are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Congridge's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves creating small tokens to channel Transmutation energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/Glêyêi9bbfqj31q.html">Glêyê</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh receives an average of 282 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh covers an area of nearly 133 km<sup>2</sup> (53 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1808 m (5931 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1417, by Glêyê. The establishment of Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<p>Lå Phäg Ÿhkphÿh's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves bloodletting to channel Mysticism energies of tier 2 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

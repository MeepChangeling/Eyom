<p>Nokëzō Lur Hadfow (/noˈkɛzoː/ /lur/ [central] [clerk]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MiqtpsukheMoot.html">Miqtpsukhe Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nokëzō Lur Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nokëzō Lur Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Dyêgfêthgkvqhzct1h.html">Dyêgfêth</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nokëzō Lur Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Nokëzō Lur Hadfow receives an average of 76 cm/y (29 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Nokëzō Lur Hadfow covers an area of nearly 90 km<sup>2</sup> (36 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4438 m (14560 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nokëzō Lur Hadfow was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1199, by Dyêgfêth. The establishment of Nokëzō Lur Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Dyêgfêth struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Nokëzō Lur Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Nokëzō Lur Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nokëzō Lur Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nokëzō Lur Hadfow is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Nokëzō Lur Hadfow was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Nokëzō Lur Hadfow's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Nokëzō Lur Hadfow's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Nokëzō Lur Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Nokëzō Lur Hadfow ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

<p>Nokëzō Lur Hadfow's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

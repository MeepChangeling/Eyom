<p>The name Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Tshêmb5vyp4shwv.html">Tshêm</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1175, by Tshêm. The establishment of Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tshêm struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm is is constructed  arround a series of crampt paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>

<p>Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm's roads were poorly made when first laid.

The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Bangeta Range, an iconic vista located neare Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm, proved to be volcanic when the range erupted. The eruption was isolated to the area around Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm, which was swallowed in ash, lava flows, and pyroclastic gasses. Tmevifùgíhg Gíhm lost 228 people, 386 livestock, and 43 buildings in the disaster. The event is forever remembered as the Day of Woe's Wrath.</p>

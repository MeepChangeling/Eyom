<p>Fënê-kesoke Ye (/ˈfënɘ/ /keˈsoke/ [tight; tense; firm; narrow] [fruit; seed]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Thel-DidCounty.html">Thel-Did County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fënê-kesoke Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Fënê-kesoke Ye was founded by Èdsh, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fënê-kesoke Ye has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Fënê-kesoke Ye receives an average of 219 cm/y (86 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Fënê-kesoke Ye covers an area of nearly 270 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1294 m (4245 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fënê-kesoke Ye was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1186, by Èdsh. The establishment of Fënê-kesoke Ye suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Fënê-kesoke Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fënê-kesoke Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fënê-kesoke Ye is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow gravel streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The mountain city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The city's millitarily questionable fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Fënê-kesoke Ye has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Fënê-kesoke Ye ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Fënê-kesoke Ye possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Fënê-kesoke Ye they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>
<p>Fënê-kesoke Ye's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Fënê-kesoke Ye tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Wayworthy (/weɪ/ /ˈwɜːði/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a tropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/NorthhedgeDutchy.html">Northhedge Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/KiveriaCounty.html">Kiveria County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wayworthy is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wayworthy was founded by Zelêv Whiffen, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wayworthy has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Wayworthy receives an average of 265 cm/y (104 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Wayworthy covers an area of nearly 315 km<sup>2</sup> (126 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1012 m (3320 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wayworthy was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1460, by Zelêv Whiffen. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Zelêv Whiffen.</p>
<p>Wayworthy was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wayworthy is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Wayworthy is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Wayworthy was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The riverside city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The city's would-be-castle fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Wayworthy hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wayworthy's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Wayworthy there is no wind.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Atomie.html">Atomie</a> near Wayworthy are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Wayworthy's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 3 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

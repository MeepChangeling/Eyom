<p>The name Fomba Fton Köz Med is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Fomba Fton Köz Med was founded by <a href="../people/InziloShuzorethc785l9qww4.html">Inzilo Shuzoreth</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Fomba Fton Köz Med covers an area of nearly 267 km<sup>2</sup> (106 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1614 m (5295 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fomba Fton Köz Med was founded durring the early 17th century in late spring of the year 1617, by Inzilo Shuzoreth. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Inzilo Shuzoreth.</p>
<p>Fomba Fton Köz Med was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fomba Fton Köz Med is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fomba Fton Köz Med is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive split-log ties streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Fomba Fton Köz Med's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Fomba Fton Köz Med has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Fomba Fton Köz Med, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>

<p>Nocton Castle (/nocton/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/OrlynDutchy.html">Orlyn Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/FusanKingdom.html">Fusan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nocton Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nocton Castle was founded by <a href="../people/CābōGoīyRyderCalvinMboīshCúó̄nḱYóńrmbErmé̄shJoīshīIvensh6c4ncd0kj.html">Cābō Goīy 'Ryder Calvin' Mboīsh Cúó̄nḱ Yóńrmb Ermé̄sh Joīshī Ivens</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nocton Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Nocton Castle receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Nocton Castle covers an area of nearly 76 km<sup>2</sup> (30 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6466 m (21213 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nocton Castle was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1231, by Cābō Goīy 'Ryder Calvin' Mboīsh Cúó̄nḱ Yóńrmb Ermé̄sh Joīshī Ivens. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Cābō Goīy 'Ryder Calvin' Mboīsh Cúó̄nḱ Yóńrmb Ermé̄sh Joīshī Ivens.</p>
<p>Nocton Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nocton Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nocton Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of narrow flagstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Unfortuantly, these robustly designed timber walls are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Nocton Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Nocton Castle is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Nocton Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

<p>Nocton Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves orgies to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 2 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Nocton Castle is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Nocton Castle is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

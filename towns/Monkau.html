<p>Monkau (/mʌŋk/ /ˌəʊ/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a tropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/LightlandDutchy.html">Lightland Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/BaldockiaMargrave.html">Baldockia Margrave</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Monkau is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Monkau was founded by Sheryl Manning, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Monkau has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Monkau receives an average of 159 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Monkau covers an area of nearly 272 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3196 m (10485 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Monkau was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1306, by Sheryl Manning. The establishment of Monkau was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Sheryl Manning electing to pay people to resettle in Monkau.</p>
<p>Monkau was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Monkau is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Monkau is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The robustly designed timber walls has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Monkau seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Monkau the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Monkau's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Monkau all of the cats speak in a dead language.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Monkau is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Monkau was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Monkau lost 158 people, 134 livestock, and 42 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 84, when members of Monkau's militia enacted an operation to gain control of a particular strategic location. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Monkau's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Monkau's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

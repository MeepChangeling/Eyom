<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gdo̠ No̠f Hadfow was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1357, by Gerain. The establishment of Gdo̠ No̠f Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Gerain struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Gdo̠ No̠f Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Gdo̠ No̠f Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gdo̠ No̠f Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Gdo̠ No̠f Hadfow is buildings are arranged arround a single spacious cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The failry decent fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Gdo̠ No̠f Hadfow, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud.

The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

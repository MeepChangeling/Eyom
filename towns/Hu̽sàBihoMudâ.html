<p>Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ (/hav/ /ˈbiho/ [Propername] [bed]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Mu̹zûGu̹mæKingdom.html">Mu̹zû Gu̹mæ Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/SiyalefiaCounty.html">Siyalefia County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/WarreneseShogunate.html">Warrenese Shogunate</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ was founded by Grraegrurth, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ receives an average of 129 cm/y (50 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ covers an area of nearly 316 km<sup>2</sup> (126 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6994 m (-20003 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1270, by Grraegrurth. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Grraegrurth.</p>
<p>Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious paverstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The riverside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Jùvob Forest was struck by a drought when Pond Suguta grew too small to continue feeding River Killingrial, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Hu̽sà Biho Mudâ lost 204 people, and 319 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 1 weeks, which are remembered as the Trepidation Thirst.</p>

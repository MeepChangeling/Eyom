<p>Lark Castle (/lɑrk/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Fersá̋ōwDutchy.html">Fersá̋ōw Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DāmêvrKingdom.html">Dāmêvr Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lark Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lark Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Dā̌SēyDazzleStunnerMāshīyDä̂Bë̌sGōw̄yVú̄Coatesqbb8z7t1ah.html">Dā̌ Sēy 'Dazzle Stunner' Māshīy Dä̂ Bë̌s Gōw̄y Vú̄ Coates</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lark Castle has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 17°C (62°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Lark Castle receives an average of 221 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Lark Castle covers an area of nearly 197 km<sup>2</sup> (78 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 324 m (1062 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lark Castle was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1257, by Dā̌ Sēy 'Dazzle Stunner' Māshīy Dä̂ Bë̌s Gōw̄y Vú̄ Coates. The establishment of Lark Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Lark Castle's construction back out of the project. Dā̌ Sēy 'Dazzle Stunner' Māshīy Dä̂ Bë̌s Gōw̄y Vú̄ Coates pushed on reguardles, and Lark Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Lark Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lark Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lark Castle is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Lark Castle was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive packed earth streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Lark Castle's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Lark Castle's unusual though effective defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Lark Castle is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Lark Castle is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 3 years has greatly spiked Lark Castle's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Toggèku Forest was struck by a drought when Lake Tauca grew too small to continue feeding Stream Cobalt, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Lark Castle. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Lark Castle lost 222 people, and 237 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 6 weeks, which are remembered as the Death Thirst.</p>

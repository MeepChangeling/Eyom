<p>Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ (/ˈaqɪː/ /ˈhoja/ [crack] [millennium]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GlikérádPrincipality.html">Glikérád Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Saborri.html">Saborri</a>.</p>
<p>The name Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Fyèlënmêz1ddqugpvl.html">Fyèlënmê</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 6°C (42°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -12°C (11°F). Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ receives an average of 166 cm/y (65 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 91 km<sup>2</sup> (36 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3382 m (11095 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1388, by Fyèlënmê. The establishment of Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Fyèlënmê electing to pay people to resettle in Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ.</p>
<p>Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ is buildings are located arround a single crampt packed earth mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ lost 222 people, 385 livestock, and 71 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 224, when members of Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ's militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular temple. The operation was complicated by the enemy setting up an ambush. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the temple, which ended in defeat for Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Aqî Hoya Kâchyâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

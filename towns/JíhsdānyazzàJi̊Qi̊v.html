<p>Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ʤɪ̞s/ /dəˑˈnjazzə/ [hip] [exempt]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Sti̊ci̊qRegion.html">Sti̊ci̊q Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Hippotherium7ykr4q4jsv.html">Hippotherium</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 30°C (86°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 197 cm/y (77 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 245 km<sup>2</sup> (98 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2940 m (9645 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1056, by Hippotherium. The establishment of Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow paverstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Jíhsdānyazzà Ji̊ Qi̊v's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

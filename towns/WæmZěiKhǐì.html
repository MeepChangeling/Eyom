<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì (/ˈzɛi/ /ˈxɪɨ/ [urban] [leisure; recreation]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/DobeguvZone.html">Dobeguv Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/Bw-186ynædDistrict.html">Bw-186ynæd District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wæm Zěi Khǐì is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Wæm Zěi Khǐì was founded by <a href="../people/H́i̊tsBrêmesmgt61g0uva8.html">H́i̊ts Brêmesm</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Wæm Zěi Khǐì receives an average of 219 cm/y (86 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Wæm Zěi Khǐì covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5122 m (16804 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1344, by H́i̊ts Brêmesm. The establishment of Wæm Zěi Khǐì was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed H́i̊ts Brêmesm struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Wæm Zěi Khǐì as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wæm Zěi Khǐì is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì is was constructed arround several crampt paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The town's failry decent fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Wæm Zěi Khǐì hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Wæm Zěi Khǐì is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Wæm Zěi Khǐì. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Wæm Zěi Khǐì's parks.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Wæm Zěi Khǐì.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Wæm Zěi Khǐì's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Wæm Zěi Khǐì's grid is powered by a direct leyline tap.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Wæm Zěi Khǐì's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>In Wæm Zěi Khǐì vermin leave small tokens in payment for food taken.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿ChurchGrim.html">﻿Church Grim</a> near Wæm Zěi Khǐì are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Wæm Zěi Khǐì's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Invocation energies of tier 1 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

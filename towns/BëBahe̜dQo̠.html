<p>Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ (/bɛ/ /ˈbahe̜d/ [safe] [knight]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MenertahashaCounty.html">Menertahasha County</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ was founded by Funabus Yandieri, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ receives an average of 150 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ covers an area of nearly 312 km<sup>2</sup> (124 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4002 m (13129 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1330, by Funabus Yandieri. The establishment of Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Funabus Yandieri struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ is buildings are speckled and packed arround crampt packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The riverside city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠'s walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ produces something unique, a good or service that cannot be had anywhere else in the kingdom. This may be due to some unique resource found only there, or some carefully-guarded craft, or it may be a special service that can only be provided by the locals, who are somehow unique in their forms or abilities.</p>
<p>Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠'s roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Bë Bahe̜d Qo̠ suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

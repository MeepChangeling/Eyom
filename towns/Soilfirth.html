<p>Soilfirth (/sɔɪl/ /fɜːθ/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SnowsilverDutchy.html">Snowsilver Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/SoroughCounty.html">Sorough County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Soilfirth is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Soilfirth was founded by <a href="../people/VelmaTrull7mw1kjfvhp.html">Velma Trull</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Soilfirth has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 20°C (68°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Soilfirth was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1319, by Velma Trull. The establishment of Soilfirth was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Velma Trull struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Soilfirth as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Soilfirth was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Soilfirth is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Soilfirth is buildings are built arround a single crampt cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The perhapse unnessisarily well built defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Looking around Soilfirth you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The center of Soilfirth's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Soilfirth used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Soilfirth.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Soilfirth was attacked by savage trollss living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Soilfirth lost 149 people, 138 livestock, and 30 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 109, when members of Soilfirth's militia enacted an operation to extract assets from a port under siege by the enemy. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with the defense of the port against a siege, which ended in victory for Soilfirth's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Soilfirth's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

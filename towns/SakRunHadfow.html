<p>Sak Run Hadfow (/sak/ /run/ [evil] [hub (center of activity)]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Mahweme̜tParish.html">Mahweme̜t Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/Ke̜kziDiocese.html">Ke̜kzi Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sak Run Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Sak Run Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Trilëissa4ja8bcu.html">Trilëi</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sak Run Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Sak Run Hadfow receives an average of 169 cm/y (66 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Sak Run Hadfow covers an area of nearly 131 km<sup>2</sup> (52 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4460 m (14632 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sak Run Hadfow was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1306, by Trilëi. The establishment of Sak Run Hadfow suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Sak Run Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sak Run Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Sak Run Hadfow is is constructed  arround a series of spacious flagstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Sak Run Hadfow's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Astonishigly, the unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Sak Run Hadfow hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Sak Run Hadfow's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Sak Run Hadfow the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

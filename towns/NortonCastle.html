<p>Norton Castle (/ˈnɔrtən/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/CastleburnDutchy.html">Castleburn Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DuyteaKingdom.html">Duytea Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Norton Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Norton Castle was founded by <a href="../people/CeriLardjzcw7m0qrp.html">Ceri Lard</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Norton Castle has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Norton Castle receives an average of 190 cm/y (74 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Norton Castle covers an area of nearly 256 km<sup>2</sup> (102 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2744 m (9002 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Norton Castle was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1503, by Ceri Lard. The establishment of Norton Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Norton Castle's construction back out of the project. Ceri Lard pushed on reguardles, and Norton Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Norton Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Norton Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Norton Castle is is constructed arround a semi-circular broad flagstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Norton Castle's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Norton Castle's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is skipped in Norton Castle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Dlurgraven.html">Dlurgraven</a> near Norton Castle are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Norton Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves creating small tokens to channel Mysticism energies of tier 1 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Norton Castle’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Norton Castle’s streets.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami spared the town from the rampage of a legendary monster. One of Norton Castle's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

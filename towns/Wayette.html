<p>Wayette (/weɪ/ /ette/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/JanbankDutchy.html">Janbank Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/CambridgeEarldom.html">Cambridge Earldom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wayette is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wayette was founded by <a href="../people/DarlaAustinEvelynHardwickeu3fhpkqwv9.html">Darla Austin Evelyn Hardwicke</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wayette has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Wayette receives an average of 143 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Wayette covers an area of nearly 277 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2244 m (7362 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wayette was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1303, by Darla Austin Evelyn Hardwicke. The establishment of Wayette suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Wayette was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wayette is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wayette is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Wayette was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Unfortuantly, these Ragnarock-era relics are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Wayette has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Wayette’s streets. A look around Wayette has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Wayette long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Wayette has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wayette's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Wayette sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Raven.html">Raven</a> near Wayette are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Wayette's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves square dance to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 3 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Wayette used to be much richer, but something happened in the last (13474 % 6)+1 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>

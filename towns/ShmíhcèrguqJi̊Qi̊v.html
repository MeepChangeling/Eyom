<p>The name Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Achassien0xti21klyd.html">Achassien</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 172 cm/y (67 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 89 km<sup>2</sup> (35 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3766 m (12355 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1449, by Achassien. The establishment of Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Achassien struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v's brittle defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v is like a look into a broken heart which long ago fell to corruption. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need… unless of course, they would be an easy target for some robbery. The city has truly fallen to evil.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Shmíhcèrguq Ji̊ Qi̊v is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness.

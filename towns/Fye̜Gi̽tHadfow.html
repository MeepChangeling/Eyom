<p>Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1072, by Lucthel. The establishment of Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community.

<p>Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow is buildings are located arround a single broad flagstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname..

Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife.</p>

It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow lost 171 people, 358 livestock, and 96 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 89, when members of Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to a particular port, then reinforce it. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with the defense of the port against a siege, which ended in victory for Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Fye̜ Gi̽t Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

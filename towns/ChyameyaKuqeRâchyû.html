<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû was founded durring the late 17th century in late summer of the year 1653, by Maud. The establishment of Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious baked earthen streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû's top tier civilian fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

The conflict ended after roughly 147, when members of Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular enemy war supplies intact. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Chyameya Kuqe Râchyû's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

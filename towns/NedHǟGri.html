<p>Ned Hǟ Gri (/ned/ /haː/ [anxious] [face; forehead; brow; side; expression; character; facade; surface]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Fio̠dyokōnMoot.html">Fio̠dyokōn Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ned Hǟ Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ned Hǟ Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Grednekktwamwxydf.html">Grednek</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ned Hǟ Gri has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Ned Hǟ Gri receives an average of 147 cm/y (57 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ned Hǟ Gri covers an area of nearly 189 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3600 m (11811 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ned Hǟ Gri was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1046, by Grednek. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Ned Hǟ Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ned Hǟ Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Ned Hǟ Gri is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt worn bedrock streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Ned Hǟ Gri's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Ned Hǟ Gri's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Ned Hǟ Gri has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Ned Hǟ Gri suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ned Hǟ Gri long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ned Hǟ Gri's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is skipped in Ned Hǟ Gri.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Trailgaunt.html">Trailgaunt</a> near Ned Hǟ Gri are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Ned Hǟ Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves line dance to channel Abjuration energies of tier 1 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Ned Hǟ Gri is surrounded by dangerous terrain: miasmatic swamps, perilous crevasses, radioactive badlands, a pocket of or some other harmful topography. Ned Hǟ Gri might prefer the defensive potential of the terrain here, or have found a precious resource worth the danger. The terrain might have formed at some time since the founding, with the citizens struggling to make terms with the new danger.</p>
<p>Ned Hǟ Gri makes use of canals for some of its streets. Locals often fish in the canals.</p>

<p>Hav Lud Gri (/hav/ /lud/ [silly; absurd] [bargain; discount]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ËkkuvMoot.html">Ëkkuv Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hav Lud Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hav Lud Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Fyèdsm3amf1z7gvb.html">Fyèdsm</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hav Lud Gri has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -12°C (11°F). Hav Lud Gri receives an average of 163 cm/y (64 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Hav Lud Gri covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3950 m (12959 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hav Lud Gri was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1161, by Fyèdsm. The establishment of Hav Lud Gri was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Fyèdsm struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Hav Lud Gri as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Hav Lud Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hav Lud Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hav Lud Gri is buildings are arranged arround a single spacious baked earthen mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Hav Lud Gri, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Hav Lud Gri is like a look into a broken heart. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need. It’s not malicious. Heads are hung. Eyes are empty. Something truly horrible happened here once upon a time and the city never healed.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 4 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>

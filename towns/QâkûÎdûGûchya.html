<p>The name Qâkû Îdû Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qâkû Îdû Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Êrêv48qpa33akk.html">Êrêv</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qâkû Îdû Gûchya was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1476, by Êrêv. The establishment of Qâkû Îdû Gûchya suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Qâkû Îdû Gûchya which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Qâkû Îdû Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qâkû Îdû Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qâkû Îdû Gûchya is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious baked earthen streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Qâkû Îdû Gûchya's millitarily questionable fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Qâkû Îdû Gûchya hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qâkû Îdû Gûchya's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Qâkû Îdû Gûchya suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<p>Qâkû Îdû Gûchya's residents established a new industry 3 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami granted the town a great harvest. One of Qâkû Îdû Gûchya's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

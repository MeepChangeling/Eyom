<p>Boke Goníhp (/gon/ /ɪ̞p/ [closure] [high; loud; noisy; tall]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/AldäbnRegion.html">Aldäbn Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Goníhp is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Goníhp was founded by <a href="../people/Acicaprau49w2t9yn5.html">Acicapra</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Goníhp has a yearly average temperature of 30°C (86°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Boke Goníhp receives an average of 274 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Goníhp covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4354 m (14284 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Goníhp was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1266, by Acicapra. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Boke Goníhp was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Goníhp is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Boke Goníhp is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious flagstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Boke Goníhp's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Boke Goníhp's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>

Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Boke Goníhp's residents established a new industry 4 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Boke Goníhp was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Boke Goníhp. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Goníhp lost 221 people, 266 livestock, and 57 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 223, when members of Boke Goníhp's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific war supplies to a particular fortification unharmed. The operation was complicated by torrential rains which turned the ground into deep mud. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Boke Goníhp's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Boke Goníhp's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

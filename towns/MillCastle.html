<p>Mill Castle (/mɪl/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/DorwaldDutchy.html">Dorwald Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/KobianKingdom.html">Kobian Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mill Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mill Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Ca̋nvé̄rSérmbBashRileyMéchī̌sCoī̋mp̪f̄ErméchīSpencer7wnwtzt4a8.html">Ca̋nvé̄r Sérmb 'Bash Riley' Méchī̌s Coī̋mp̪f̄ Erméchī Spencer</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mill Castle has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Mill Castle receives an average of 264 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mill Castle covers an area of nearly 225 km<sup>2</sup> (90 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3302 m (10833 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mill Castle was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1385, by Ca̋nvé̄r Sérmb 'Bash Riley' Méchī̌s Coī̋mp̪f̄ Erméchī Spencer. The establishment of Mill Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Mill Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Mill Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mill Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Mill Castle is is constructed arround a semi-circular spacious canals mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Mill Castle's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Mill Castle's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Mill Castle proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Mill Castle is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Mill Castle's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Giantcockroach.html">Giant cockroach</a> near Mill Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Mill Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Necromancy energies of tier 3 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

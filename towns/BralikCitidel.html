<p>Bralik Citidel (/breɪn/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bralik Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Bralik Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/FyêpíRixonx6m5t0yq1v.html">Fyêpí Rixon</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bralik Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Bralik Citidel receives an average of 258 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Bralik Citidel covers an area of nearly 95 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3750 m (12303 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bralik Citidel was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1218, by Fyêpí Rixon. The establishment of Bralik Citidel suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Bralik Citidel which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Bralik Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bralik Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bralik Citidel is buildings are located arround a single restrictive paverstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Bralik Citidel's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Bralik Citidel gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily.

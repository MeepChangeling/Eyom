<p>Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ (/ˈgɪːjæ/ /ˈkɑzi/ [whole; entire] [bubble]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Mequ̽LerûKingdom.html">Mequ̽ Lerû Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/HenebtyrosCounty.html">Henebtyros County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/WarreneseShogunate.html">Warrenese Shogunate</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ was founded by <a href="../people/Glilëff9mxuaapc.html">Glilë</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 1°C (33°F). Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ receives an average of 283 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ covers an area of nearly 273 km<sup>2</sup> (109 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3068 m (10065 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1089, by Glilë. The establishment of Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ's construction back out of the project. Glilë pushed on reguardles, and Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ is buildings have been located at convienant points along the swamp Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The would-be-castle fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Gîyæ Kâzi Mudâ ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, curved windows, and decorative trim work. .</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

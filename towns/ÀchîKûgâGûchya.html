<p>Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya (/ke/ /ˈkʊgɑ/ [peach] [glory]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/KàlàLehoKingdom.html">Kàlà Leho Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/BàzeLoguEmpire.html">Bàze Logu Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Okap9qcpsaff6.html">Oka</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 6°C (42°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 2°C (35°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya receives an average of 201 cm/y (79 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the long winter months. Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya covers an area of nearly 146 km<sup>2</sup> (58 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2020 m (6627 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1322, by Oka. The establishment of Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya is buildings are arranged within a network of spacious flagstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>In Àchî Kûgâ Gûchya all of the cats speak in a dead language.</p>

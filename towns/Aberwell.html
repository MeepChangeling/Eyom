<p>Aberwell (/aberwell/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/IliqtpososiDutchy.html">Iliqtpososi Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/RuwiaCounty.html">Ruwia County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Aberwell is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Aberwell was founded by <a href="../people/NeotelaGundyutkrk2cwjx.html">Neotela Gundy</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Aberwell has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Aberwell receives an average of 158 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Aberwell covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3384 m (11102 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Aberwell was founded durring the late 10th century, by Neotela Gundy. The establishment of Aberwell  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Aberwell's construction back out of the project. Neotela Gundy pushed on reguardles, and Aberwell was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Aberwell was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Aberwell is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Aberwell is buildings have been located at convienant points along the swamp Aberwell was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious paverstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the town's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Aberwell's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Unfortuantly, these top tier civilian fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Aberwell seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Aberwell has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Aberwell. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Aberwell's parks.</p>
<p>Aberwell has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Aberwell.</p>
<p>Aberwell has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Aberwell has a Department of Firefighters, which is responsible for organizing fire fighting efforts during a fire and enforcing local ordinances relating to fire safety.</p>
<p>Aberwell has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Aberwell has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Aberwell's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Aberwell possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Aberwell has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Aberwell's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Aberwell has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Aberwell has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Aberwell has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Aberwell, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Aberwell's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Aberwell.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿MudElementalLarge.html">﻿Mud Elemental, Large</a> near Aberwell are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Aberwell's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves gestures to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 2 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Aberwell is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Aberwell was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Aberwell lost 182 people, 156 livestock, and 29 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 85, when members of Aberwell's militia enacted an operation to locate a specific  faction leader. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with the defense of the vault against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Aberwell's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Aberwell's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

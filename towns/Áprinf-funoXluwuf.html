<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Áprinf-funo Xluwuf was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1213, by Grivguis. The establishment of Áprinf-funo Xluwuf suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Áprinf-funo Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Áprinf-funo Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Áprinf-funo Xluwuf is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Áprinf-funo Xluwuf's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Unfortuantly, these top tier civilian fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>

Yet, deep down, you know this atmosphere is a carefully created illusion. You can see the ocasional seam in their tapestry. You’re not sure what has them doing their best to act so carefree, but act carefree they do.</p>

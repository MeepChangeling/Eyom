<p>Dragonlily (/dragonlily/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small Town located in <a href="../subprovences/TyōrlëtKingdom.html">Tyōrlët Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/DamozajiuCounty.html">Damozajiu County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dragonlily is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Dragonlily was founded by <a href="../people/IdiGore-BrowneHuckerBacoteChorltong8xx2m4atu.html">Idi Gore-Browne Hucker Bacote Chorlton</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dragonlily has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Dragonlily receives an average of 159 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Dragonlily covers an area of nearly 3 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5918 m (19416 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dragonlily was founded durring the early 10th century, by Idi Gore-Browne Hucker Bacote Chorlton. The establishment of Dragonlily was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Idi Gore-Browne Hucker Bacote Chorlton struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Dragonlily as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Dragonlily was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dragonlily is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Dragonlily is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Dragonlily was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Dragonlily's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The town's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Dragonlily is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this town live.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Dragonlily has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Dragonlily.</p>
<p>Dragonlily has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The law within Dragonlily is highly corrupt, or does not apply to certain favored groups or castes. Strangers might be fleeced by local lawmen, evildoers can be absolved by a payment, and powerful gentry do as they please.</p>
<p>Dragonlily's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Dragonlily snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>

<p>Dragonlily's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves ritual combat to channel Mysticism energies of tier 2 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

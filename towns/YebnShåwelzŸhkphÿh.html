<p>Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh (/jibn/ /s̼ɑːˈwelz/ [cool )slightly cold)] [temple; church]) is a temperate Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/PhÿvÿhpmHold.html">Phÿvÿhpm Hold</a>, <a href="../provences/QättzaKingdom.html">Qättza Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Undermountain.html">Undermountain</a>.</p>
<p>The name Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/Rrhithnorwu8flnwtql.html">Rrhithnor</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh receives an average of 277 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh covers an area of nearly 11 km<sup>2</sup> (4 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2592 m (8503 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the early 9th century, by Rrhithnor. The establishment of Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh's construction back out of the project. Rrhithnor pushed on reguardles, and Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh lost 169 people, 294 livestock, and 85 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 209, when members of Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh's militia enacted an operation to rescue a specific  expert from the enemy. The operation was complicated by torrential rains which turned the ground into deep mud. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Yebn Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Kad Irr-yánw (/irr/ /jə˞nw/ [fire] [rake; fork]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ÁärvconksPrincipality.html">Áärvconks Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Shayeli.html">Shayeli</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Irr-yánw is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Irr-yánw was founded by <a href="../people/Gîdgdzuqz1lwc.html">Gîd</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Irr-yánw has a yearly average temperature of 3°C (37°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a freezing -1°C (31°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Kad Irr-yánw receives an average of 210 cm/y (82 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the long winter months. Kad Irr-yánw covers an area of nearly 67 km<sup>2</sup> (26 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1854 m (6082 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Irr-yánw was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1460, by Gîd. The establishment of Kad Irr-yánw  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Kad Irr-yánw's construction back out of the project. Gîd pushed on reguardles, and Kad Irr-yánw was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Kad Irr-yánw was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Irr-yánw is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kad Irr-yánw is was constructed arround several narrow paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Kad Irr-yánw, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Irr-yánw gives you a feeling of distrust and paranoia. Also greed. The locals seem to be very much into scholastic pursuits, based on the hushed, murmured conversations you hear at least. Everyone in Kad Irr-yánw acts like they have discovered something wondrous, and are worried they will endure some horrible fate so another can take what they’ve discovered for themselves.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Kad Irr-yánw has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Irr-yánw's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Kad Irr-yánw.</p>

<p>Kad Irr-yánw's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Conjuration energies of tier 3 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kad Irr-yánw was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kad Irr-yánw lost 129 people, 283 livestock, and 53 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 122, when members of Kad Irr-yánw's militia enacted an operation to deliver supplies to a specific group of civilians. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with the defense of the research site against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Kad Irr-yánw's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kad Irr-yánw's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

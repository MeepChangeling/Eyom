<p>Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm (/ˈvʊzkɛj̼/ /ˈcifi/ [position (location)] [nervous; anxious]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kshizbāj̼Provence.html">Kshizbāj̼ Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Nerysf9ww6kqz47.html">Nerys</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm receives an average of 199 cm/y (78 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm covers an area of nearly 138 km<sup>2</sup> (55 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1148 m (3766 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1415, by Nerys. The establishment of Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Vùzkèiē̼cifi Gíhm suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

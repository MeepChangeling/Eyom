<p>Lovaton Castle (/lovaton/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/MaplebeachDutchy.html">Maplebeach Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/JieaKingdom.html">Jiea Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lovaton Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lovaton Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Dúil̄Clitheroe77tjqg2cpp.html">Dúil̄ Clitheroe</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lovaton Castle has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Lovaton Castle receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lovaton Castle covers an area of nearly 13 km<sup>2</sup> (5 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6704 m (-20954 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lovaton Castle was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1160, by Dúil̄ Clitheroe. The establishment of Lovaton Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Lovaton Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Lovaton Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lovaton Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lovaton Castle is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow worn bedrock streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Lovaton Castle has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lovaton Castle long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lovaton Castle has a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.</p>
<p>Lovaton Castle's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Lovaton Castle was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lovaton Castle lost 260 people, 260 livestock, and 70 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 186, when members of Lovaton Castle's militia enacted an operation to deliver supplies to a particular solgiers group. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Lovaton Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lovaton Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

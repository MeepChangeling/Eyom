<p>The name Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Breshêm757ugm05df.html">Breshêm</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1378, by Breshêm. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Breshêm.</p>
<p>Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow baked earthen mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p>Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ was struck by unseasonably warm weather, causing a sweltering heat to smouther the land for 11 days. Bàdahya Guchyà Kâchyâ lost 160 people and  199 livestock in the disaster.. The deadly heat is remembered by most as the Mourning's Flame.</p>

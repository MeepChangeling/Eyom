<p>Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch (/lə̝s/ /huch/ [sorry; sad] [origin]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Zophtevub̄Provence.html">Zophtevub̄ Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch was founded by <a href="../people/Èbê048amga7iz.html">Èbê</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch receives an average of 244 cm/y (96 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch covers an area of nearly 86 km<sup>2</sup> (34 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 9138 m (-12969 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch was founded durring the late 19th century in late winter of the year 1781, by Èbê. The establishment of Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 19th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive canals streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The political statment focused walls have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch grains of dust blow into perfectly neat rows.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch was attacked by a slaver gang capable of fielding large forces. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch lost 291 people, 223 livestock, and 58 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 87, when members of Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the strategic location, which ended in defeat for Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qÿhtvehb Rehäq Huch's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

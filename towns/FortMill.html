<p>Fort Mill (/mɪl/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/SpellashDutchy.html">Spellash Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/IvbeaKingdom.html">Ivbea Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Mill is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Mill was founded by <a href="../people/MaegangBatchelortd75yltq00.html">Maegang Batchelor</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Mill has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Fort Mill receives an average of 144 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Fort Mill covers an area of nearly 30 km<sup>2</sup> (12 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5502 m (18051 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Mill was founded durring the early 11th century, by Maegang Batchelor. The establishment of Fort Mill  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Fort Mill's construction back out of the project. Maegang Batchelor pushed on reguardles, and Fort Mill was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Fort Mill was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Mill is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fort Mill is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive worn bedrock streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a city of Fort Mill's size could have. The city's well-designed, yet cheep are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fort Mill hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<p>Fort Mill's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Fort Mill is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Fort Mill is known for its well built pedestrian paths, which include foot bridges to cross the main street at several high-traffic areas.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Fort Mill was struck by unseasonably warm weather, causing a sweltering heat to smouther the land for 26 days. Fort Mill lost 229 people and  131 livestock in the disaster.. The deadly heat is remembered by most as the Doom's Flame.</p>

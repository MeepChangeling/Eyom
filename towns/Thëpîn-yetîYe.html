<p>Thëpîn-yetî Ye (/ˈmèha/ /ˈjetɪ/ [real; authentic] [book; novel]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SzoreCounty.html">Szore County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Thëpîn-yetî Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Thëpîn-yetî Ye was founded by Zaadgiag, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Thëpîn-yetî Ye has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Thëpîn-yetî Ye receives an average of 239 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Thëpîn-yetî Ye covers an area of nearly 369 km<sup>2</sup> (147 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1162 m (3812 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Thëpîn-yetî Ye was founded durring the late 10th century, by Zaadgiag. The establishment of Thëpîn-yetî Ye suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Thëpîn-yetî Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Thëpîn-yetî Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Thëpîn-yetî Ye is buildings are arranged arround a single spacious cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The riverside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Thëpîn-yetî Ye, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Thëpîn-yetî Ye proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Thëpîn-yetî Ye possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Thëpîn-yetî Ye's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is long in Thëpîn-yetî Ye.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

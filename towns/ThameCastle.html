<p>Thame Castle (/thame/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SwynwallDutchy.html">Swynwall Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MidateKingdom.html">Midate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Thame Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Thame Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Ha̋nḱCa̋mBelleGarnetMbōyVúchvórHa̋chvēshMeriweathery8cj1uc2c5.html">Ha̋nḱ Ca̋m 'Belle Garnet' Mbōy Vúchvór Ha̋chvēsh Meriweather</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Thame Castle has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F). Thame Castle receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Thame Castle covers an area of nearly 97 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3904 m (12808 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Thame Castle was founded durring the early 11th century, by Ha̋nḱ Ca̋m 'Belle Garnet' Mbōy Vúchvór Ha̋chvēsh Meriweather. The establishment of Thame Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Thame Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Thame Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Thame Castle is is constructed arround a semi-circular narrow cobblestone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Thame Castle has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Thame Castle ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Thame Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Thame Castle there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Yeti.html">Yeti</a> near Thame Castle are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Thame Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 2 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Thame Castle was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Thame Castle lost 113 people, 217 livestock, and 89 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 81, when members of Thame Castle's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about a particular mine. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Thame Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Thame Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

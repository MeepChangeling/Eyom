<p>Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî (/zɘ/ /iˈhɪkɘ èˈjɘco/ [green] [dentist]) is a subtropical Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/Ineg̈èshoZone.html">Ineg̈èsho Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî was founded by <a href="../people/ZelëdZlêbmyb7y9v0bbm.html">Zelëd Zlêbm</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî receives an average of 286 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî covers an area of nearly 7 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2020 m (6627 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1122, by Zelëd Zlêbm. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî is buildings folow an organic layout of spacious canals streets whihch gives the town a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The town's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the towns defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî has a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.</p>
<p>Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî rainbows form quite often above the Large Town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\IceElementalMedium.html">Ice Elemental, Medium</a> near Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Rio-ihîkê Èyêco Bî's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves reenactments to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 3 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

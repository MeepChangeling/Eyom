<p>Birk Castle (/bɜrk/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Birk Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Birk Castle was founded by <a href="../people/HāshErmpftó̄̄NinaMelodyRéó̄MboīboīYa̋mpf̄̄Aymesxsq5zm32ry.html">Hāsh Ermpftó̄̄ 'Nina Melody' Réó̄ Mboīboī Ya̋mpf̄̄ Aymes</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Birk Castle has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Birk Castle receives an average of 287 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Birk Castle covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1754 m (5754 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Birk Castle was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1284, by Hāsh Ermpftó̄̄ 'Nina Melody' Réó̄ Mboīboī Ya̋mpf̄̄ Aymes. The establishment of Birk Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Hāsh Ermpftó̄̄ 'Nina Melody' Réó̄ Mboīboī Ya̋mpf̄̄ Aymes struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Birk Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Birk Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Birk Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Birk Castle is is constructed arround a semi-circular restrictive baked earthen mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Birk Castle's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Birk Castle has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Birk Castle ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Birk Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Birk Castle it is impossible to directly or indirectly lie.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

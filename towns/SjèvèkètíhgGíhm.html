<p>Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm (Sjèvè /ˈkɛtɪ̞g/ [total; sum; score; amount; profit] [existence]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MàvēvāvRegion.html">Màvēvāv Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Holgerhk0lddswjra.html">Holgerh</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm receives an average of 178 cm/y (70 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm covers an area of nearly 147 km<sup>2</sup> (58 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4256 m (13963 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1194, by Holgerh. The establishment of Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm's construction back out of the project. Holgerh pushed on reguardles, and Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm is buildings are arranged arround a single premissive split-log ties mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm’s streets.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Life is hard in Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm. Its people are impoverished compared to their peers elsewhere. Something is making the locals stay, however, whether fear of the alternative, hope for a better future, or a stubborn attachment to their ancestral lands. Whatver the reason, living in this harsh area for generations has made the people of Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm a notably resourceful and hearty people.</p>
<p>Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is skipped in Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿Mole.html">﻿Mole</a> near Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves ritual combat to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 3 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Sjèvèkètíhg Gíhm suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes.

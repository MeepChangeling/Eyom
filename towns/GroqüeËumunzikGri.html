<p>Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri (/groq˔/ /ˌɛuˈmunzik/ [blue; dark blue] [relationship]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BrotlëftavremōfMoot.html">Brotlëftavremōf Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Kolvidbqfssdgzyy.html">Kolvid</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F). Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri covers an area of nearly 113 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3030 m (9940 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri was founded durring the early 10th century, by Kolvid. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri is is constructed arround a semi-circular narrow paverstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri's budget focused millitary grade defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is short in Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 3 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri lost 275 people, 293 livestock, and 54 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 74, when members of Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri's militia enacted an operation to recruit a specific  noble. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the ruin, which ended in a stalemate for Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Groqüe Ëumunzik Gri's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

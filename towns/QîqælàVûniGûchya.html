<p>Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya (/qɪːˈqælə/ /ˈvʊni/ [expensive] [group; herd; flock; party]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Mihâs̺ilàDûbiKingdom.html">Mihâs̺ilà Dûbi Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/Bæru̽saVu̽Empire.html">Bæru̽sa Vu̽ Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Galbeny7zr4fapx1.html">Galben</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 5°C (41°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya receives an average of 227 cm/y (89 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya covers an area of nearly 139 km<sup>2</sup> (55 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1170 m (3838 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1176, by Galben. The establishment of Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Galben struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive baked earthen streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya is home to a distinct subculture, who are either the majority here or have the dominant positions in the community. Architecture, local laws, and social customs are all tuned to suit them, and they may not be particularly forgiving or friendly to the major culture of the region. Communities that are not outright independent usually make an arm's-length submission to a local lord.</p>
<p>Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\GolemIce.html">Golem, Ice</a> near Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves creating small tokens to channel Transmutation energies of tier 3 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya lost 246 people, 218 livestock, and 79 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 175, when members of Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to extract assets from a temple under siege by the enemy. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qîqælà Vûni Gûchya's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

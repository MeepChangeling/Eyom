<p>The name Píebë-êdi Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Píebë-êdi Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Grilëgbfy6kvs26.html">Grilë</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Píebë-êdi Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Píebë-êdi Ratê receives an average of 183 cm/y (72 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Píebë-êdi Ratê covers an area of nearly 63 km<sup>2</sup> (25 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3196 m (10485 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Píebë-êdi Ratê was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1129, by Grilë. The establishment of Píebë-êdi Ratê was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Grilë electing to pay people to resettle in Píebë-êdi Ratê.</p>
<p>Píebë-êdi Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Píebë-êdi Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Píebë-êdi Ratê is buildings are arranged within a network of restrictive baked earthen streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Píebë-êdi Ratê, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Píebë-êdi Ratê is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> slew a dragon and brought its hoard to Píebë-êdi Ratê, where it was shared with all. The recitation of the hero's story remains a popular tavern and fair tale.</p>

<p>The name Shenê-píêbo Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Shenê-píêbo Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Glargumcmcd14j1my.html">Glargum</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Shenê-píêbo Ratê covers an area of nearly 63 km<sup>2</sup> (25 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4376 m (14356 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Shenê-píêbo Ratê was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1394, by Glargum. The establishment of Shenê-píêbo Ratê was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Glargum struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Shenê-píêbo Ratê as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Shenê-píêbo Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Shenê-píêbo Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Shenê-píêbo Ratê is buildings are arranged arround a single broad carved bedrock mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Shenê-píêbo Ratê's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Astonishigly, the political statment focused walls are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Shenê-píêbo Ratê is like a look into a broken heart. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need. It’s not malicious. Heads are hung. Eyes are empty. Something truly horrible happened here once upon a time and the city never healed.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types.

<p>The name Whïzd-kad Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Whïzd-kad Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Ůhú2l8iy7kdyy.html">Ůhú</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Whïzd-kad Xluwuf was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1298, by Ůhú. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Whïzd-kad Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Whïzd-kad Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Whïzd-kad Xluwuf is is constructed arround a semi-circular restrictive flagstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Whïzd-kad Xluwuf's robustly designed timber walls has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Whïzd-kad Xluwuf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Whïzd-kad Xluwuf is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>

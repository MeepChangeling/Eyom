<p>Stanham Castle (/stanham/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/VioletdellDutchy.html">Violetdell Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/IpoulanKingdom.html">Ipoulan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Stanham Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Stanham Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ZairdukParri5pajkw2aj.html">Zairduk Parr</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Stanham Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Stanham Castle receives an average of 279 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Stanham Castle covers an area of nearly 167 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1592 m (5223 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Stanham Castle was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1225, by Zairduk Parr. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Zairduk Parr.</p>
<p>Stanham Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Stanham Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Stanham Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad packed earth streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Stanham Castle's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Stanham Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art.

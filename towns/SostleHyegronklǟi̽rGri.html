<p>Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri (/ˈsostle/ /ˌhjegronˈklaːi̽r/ [FALSE] [interior]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Wokki̽kMoot.html">Wokki̽k Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Dyêbmëwp3qh9l7ra.html">Dyêbmë</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri receives an average of 144 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri covers an area of nearly 102 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5546 m (18195 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1098, by Dyêbmë. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Dyêbmë.</p>
<p>Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri is was constructed arround several premissive paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The political statment focused walls have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Sostle Hyegronklǟi̽r Gri was like during the glorydays.</p>

<p>The name Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Ghebitga401mh45.html">Ghebi</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya was founded durring the early 17th century in early summer of the year 1636, by Ghebi. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ghebi.</p>
<p>Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The city's millitarily questionable fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya lost 244 people, 204 livestock, and 36 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 50, when members of Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to destroy or capture a particular production site. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Lu̹beya Dæbà Gûchya's forces.

<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ (/e̜/ /hje̜w/ [long] [comment]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Bek'thondEarldom.html">Bek'thond Earldom</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ was founded by Trryhn Vimeni, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ has a yearly average temperature of 0°C (32°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -27°C (-16°F). E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ receives an average of 273 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ covers an area of nearly 286 km<sup>2</sup> (114 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2404 m (7887 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ was founded durring the late 17th century in early spring of the year 1657, by Trryhn Vimeni. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Trryhn Vimeni.</p>
<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The byou city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠'s walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠'s natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠'s locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠'s bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is recurring in E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Necrocraft.html">Necrocraft</a> near E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠'s citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves gestures to channel Abjuration energies of tier 3 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠ lost 124 people, 351 livestock, and 39 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 151, when members of E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠'s militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy faction leader. The operation was complicated by thick blankets of fog, which hid friend and foe alike. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠'s forces. The war is remembered in legend by E̜ Hie̜w Qo̠'s bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

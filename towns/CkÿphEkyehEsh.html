<p>Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh (/faldz/ /es̼/ [wide; broad] [step (one level of stairs)]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NazahShire.html">Nazah Shire</a> of the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHobben.html">Kingdom of Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh was founded by Tregfesê Yadequg, who was culturaly Dwarvern.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh receives an average of 262 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh covers an area of nearly 395 km<sup>2</sup> (158 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3112 m (10209 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1235, by Tregfesê Yadequg. The establishment of Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh's construction back out of the project. Tregfesê Yadequg pushed on reguardles, and Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh is is constructed  arround a series of spacious packed earth mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The valley city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Unfortuantly, these exceptionaly well made fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>=In Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh when drawing, it's impossible to draw an imperfect circle.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami ended a famine plaguing Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh. One of Ckÿph Ekyeh Esh's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

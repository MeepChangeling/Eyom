<p>The name Boke Vudreshsobtíhw is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Vudreshsobtíhw was founded by <a href="../people/Shèbrêth2z728uqlj2.html">Shèbrêth</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Vudreshsobtíhw was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1154, by Shèbrêth. The establishment of Boke Vudreshsobtíhw  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Boke Vudreshsobtíhw's construction back out of the project. Shèbrêth pushed on reguardles, and Boke Vudreshsobtíhw was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Boke Vudreshsobtíhw was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Vudreshsobtíhw is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Boke Vudreshsobtíhw is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Boke Vudreshsobtíhw, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Boke Vudreshsobtíhw's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Vudreshsobtíhw has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Boke Vudreshsobtíhw long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Boke Vudreshsobtíhw was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Vudreshsobtíhw lost 148 people, 333 livestock, and 45 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 47, when members of Boke Vudreshsobtíhw's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular enemy war supplies intact. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons.

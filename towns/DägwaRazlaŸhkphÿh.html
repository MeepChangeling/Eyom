<p>Dägwa Razla Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dägwa Razla Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Dägwa Razla Ÿhkphÿh is is constructed arround a semi-circular premissive gravel mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points.

The city's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials.

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Dägwa Razla Ÿhkphÿh was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Dägwa Razla Ÿhkphÿh.

<p>The name Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Dyëm3jipz8zqg7.html">Dyëm</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1165, by Dyëm. The establishment of Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Dyëm electing to pay people to resettle in Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf.</p>
<p>Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf is is constructed arround a semi-circular spacious flagstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf lost 203 people, 214 livestock, and 46 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 215, when members of Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular strategic location from enemy attack. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ipïtä-dam Xluwuf's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

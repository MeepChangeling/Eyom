<p>Brain Citidel (/breɪn/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/DellmontDutchy.html">Dellmont Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/FusanKingdom.html">Fusan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Brain Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Brain Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/MademusNicholsxwad5dk3s1.html">Mademus Nichols</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Brain Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Brain Citidel receives an average of 141 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Brain Citidel covers an area of nearly 41 km<sup>2</sup> (16 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2258 m (7408 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Brain Citidel was founded durring the early 9th century, by Mademus Nichols. The establishment of Brain Citidel suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Brain Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Brain Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Brain Citidel is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Brain Citidel's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Brain Citidel has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Brain Citidel ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Brain Citidel's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Brain Citidel is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Brain Citidel's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Brain Citidel suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century heavy spring rains following an uncharacteristically dry year and a minor earthquake resulted in the collapse of the south face of Mount Arragats. the landslide struck Brain Citidel, and devastated the community. 219 people, 168 livestock, and 57 buildings were lost to the calamity. The disaster is recorded in history as Suffering's Fall.</p>

<p>Vātníhgof Gíhm (/ˈvəˑtnɪ̞/ /gof/ [address] [opposite]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NijhobbubRegion.html">Nijhobbub Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vātníhgof Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Vātníhgof Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Passetura746nsh45wb.html">Passetura</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vātníhgof Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Vātníhgof Gíhm receives an average of 298 cm/y (117 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Vātníhgof Gíhm covers an area of nearly 57 km<sup>2</sup> (22 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 410 m (1345 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vātníhgof Gíhm was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1294, by Passetura. The establishment of Vātníhgof Gíhm was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Passetura struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Vātníhgof Gíhm as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Vātníhgof Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vātníhgof Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Vātníhgof Gíhm is was constructed arround several broad cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Vātníhgof Gíhm's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Vātníhgof Gíhm's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Vātníhgof Gíhm hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Vātníhgof Gíhm's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

Architectural characteristics include balustrades, balconies, columns, cornices, pilasters, and triangular pediments. Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. Interiors will often have a grand stairway and opulent ballroom..</p>
<p>In Vātníhgof Gíhm tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

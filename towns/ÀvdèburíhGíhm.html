<p>Àvdèburíh Gíhm (/ˈəvdɛ/ /ˈburɪ̞/ [feast] [summary]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/Tmíhiy̼gelfàfRegion.html">Tmíhiy̼gelfàf Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Àvdèburíh Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Àvdèburíh Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/GiantAntLion7pk8tvcrz4.html">Giant Ant Lion</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Àvdèburíh Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 32°C (89°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 35°C (95°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 29°C (84°F). Àvdèburíh Gíhm receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Àvdèburíh Gíhm covers an area of nearly 41 km<sup>2</sup> (16 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3130 m (10269 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Àvdèburíh Gíhm was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1271, by Giant Ant Lion. The establishment of Àvdèburíh Gíhm suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Àvdèburíh Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Àvdèburíh Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Àvdèburíh Gíhm is buildings are arranged within a network of narrow flagstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Àvdèburíh Gíhm has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Àvdèburíh Gíhm ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

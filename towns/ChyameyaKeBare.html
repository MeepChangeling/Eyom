<p>The name Chyameya Ke Bare is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Ke Bare was founded by <a href="../people/Cecilymaa404yi0.html">Cecil</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyameya Ke Bare has a yearly average temperature of 11°C (51°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -3°C (27°F). Chyameya Ke Bare receives an average of 92 cm/y (36 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Ke Bare was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1488, by Cecil. The establishment of Chyameya Ke Bare was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Cecil struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Chyameya Ke Bare as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Chyameya Ke Bare was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Ke Bare is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Ke Bare is is constructed  arround a series of crampt gravel mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Chyameya Ke Bare's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Chyameya Ke Bare hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

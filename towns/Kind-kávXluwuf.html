<p>Kind-káv Xluwuf (/cind/ /kə˞v/ [tropical] [benefit]) is a temperate City located in the <a href="../provences/NgelágemimPrincipality.html">Ngelágemim Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Pelala.html">Pelala</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kind-káv Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kind-káv Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Dygzothsu8u0gp2fw.html">Dygzoth</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kind-káv Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -10°C (14°F). Kind-káv Xluwuf receives an average of 225 cm/y (88 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Kind-káv Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 36 km<sup>2</sup> (14 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2902 m (9520 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kind-káv Xluwuf was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1251, by Dygzoth. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Dygzoth.</p>
<p>Kind-káv Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kind-káv Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kind-káv Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of broad canals streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Kind-káv Xluwuf's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Kind-káv Xluwuf seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kind-káv Xluwuf's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is long in Kind-káv Xluwuf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way.

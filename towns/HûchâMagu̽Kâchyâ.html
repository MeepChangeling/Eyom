<p>Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ (/ˈhʊʧɑ/ /ˈmagu̽/ [exotic] [percent]) is a temperate City located in the <a href="../provences/Temmī̄fPrincipality.html">Temmī̄f Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Lallalo.html">Lallalo</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Cä̂f̄nḱYó̄nḱAmethystGinaRē̋BéchīsGawm1mr9drwybt.html">Cä̂f̄nḱ Yó̄nḱ 'Amethyst Gina' Rē̋ Béchīs Gawm</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -17°C (2°F). Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ receives an average of 105 cm/y (41 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 27 km<sup>2</sup> (10 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5756 m (18884 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 10th century, by Cä̂f̄nḱ Yó̄nḱ 'Amethyst Gina' Rē̋ Béchīs Gawm. The establishment of Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ is was constructed arround several crampt packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Unfortuantly, these perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ was attacked by savage trollss living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ lost 185 people, 209 livestock, and 23 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 66, when members of Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular  expert, and ensure they remain out of enemy hands. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the strategic location, which ended in defeat for Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Hûchâ Magu̽ Kâchyâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

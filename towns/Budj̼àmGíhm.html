<p>Budj̼àm Gíhm (/bud/ /j̼əm/ [trail] [general]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/VātuchàjùRegion.html">Vātuchàjù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Budj̼àm Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Budj̼àm Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Treshèbrêud3vxn3cw7.html">Treshèbrê</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Budj̼àm Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Budj̼àm Gíhm receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Budj̼àm Gíhm covers an area of nearly 176 km<sup>2</sup> (70 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1676 m (5498 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Budj̼àm Gíhm was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1176, by Treshèbrê. The establishment of Budj̼àm Gíhm was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Treshèbrê struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Budj̼àm Gíhm as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Budj̼àm Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Budj̼àm Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Budj̼àm Gíhm is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Budj̼àm Gíhm's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Astonishigly, the unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Budj̼àm Gíhm gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Budj̼àm Gíhm brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Budj̼àm Gíhm's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Budj̼àm Gíhm there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Caypup.html">Caypup</a> near Budj̼àm Gíhm are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Budj̼àm Gíhm's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Invocation energies of tier 3 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Budj̼àm Gíhm's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Budj̼àm Gíhm suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Budj̼àm Gíhm is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Budj̼àm Gíhm was attacked by savage scorpionfolks living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Budj̼àm Gíhm lost 236 people, 240 livestock, and 95 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 83, when members of Budj̼àm Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to construct defenses in a particular depot. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Budj̼àm Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Budj̼àm Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v (/li̘r/ /j̼om/ [contract] [only]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/VātuchàjùRegion.html">Vātuchàjù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Zêlêmwgabk3rr6c.html">Zêlêm</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 253 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 82 km<sup>2</sup> (32 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1936 m (6351 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1097, by Zêlêm. The establishment of Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged within a network of crampt cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v's failry decent fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>Li̊ry̼om Ji̊ Qi̊v's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>

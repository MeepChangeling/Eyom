<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî (/ˈg̃ajè/ /ˈlaci/ [happy] [spider]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/YêmëcêZone.html">Yêmëcê Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name G̈ayè-laci Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as G̈ayè-laci Bî was founded by <a href="../people/GwenÊrêyeshc0n5jz32b6.html">Gwen Êrêyesh</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). G̈ayè-laci Bî receives an average of 252 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. G̈ayè-laci Bî covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5004 m (16417 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1064, by Gwen Êrêyesh. The establishment of G̈ayè-laci Bî suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and G̈ayè-laci Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt paverstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. G̈ayè-laci Bî's exceptionaly well made fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of G̈ayè-laci Bî, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the town. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within G̈ayè-laci Bî.</p>

<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain G̈ayè-laci Bî's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In G̈ayè-laci Bî all of the cats speak the local language with prefect diction.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SwanTrumpeter.html">Swan, Trumpeter</a> near G̈ayè-laci Bî are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>G̈ayè-laci Bî's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves drinking to channel Transmutation energies of tier 1 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

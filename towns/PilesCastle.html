<p>The name Piles Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Piles Castle was founded by <a href="../people/MaegangDriver8xuys1v0mu.html">Maegang Driver</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Piles Castle has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Piles Castle receives an average of 219 cm/y (86 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Piles Castle covers an area of nearly 36 km<sup>2</sup> (14 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 538 m (1765 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Piles Castle was founded durring the early 10th century, by Maegang Driver. The establishment of Piles Castle was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Maegang Driver electing to pay people to resettle in Piles Castle.</p>
<p>Piles Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Piles Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Piles Castle is buildings are built arround a single broad worn bedrock mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Piles Castle has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Piles Castle ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Piles Castle, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Piles Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Piles Castle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿Ahlinni.html">﻿Ahlinni</a> near Piles Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

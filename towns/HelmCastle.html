<p>Helm Castle (/hɛlm/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/AelwheatDutchy.html">Aelwheat Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/SifateKingdom.html">Sifate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Helm Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Helm Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ThiliorilParhamyb3a18jiw6.html">Thilioril Parham</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Helm Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Helm Castle receives an average of 146 cm/y (57 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Helm Castle covers an area of nearly 41 km<sup>2</sup> (16 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2034 m (6673 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Helm Castle was founded durring the early 17th century in early fall of the year 1606, by Thilioril Parham. The establishment of Helm Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Helm Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Helm Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Helm Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Helm Castle is is constructed  arround a series of premissive carved bedrock mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Astonishigly, the perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Helm Castle is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. There’s a patern to the panic. It’s not easy to see, and no one quite agrees on what it is, but the locals know and operate under this pattern. It shapes everything they do, and you feel as if you’ve almost worked it out only for some small detail to devastate your theory every time you try and comprehend it.</p>

<p>Helm Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>

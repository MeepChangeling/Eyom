<p>Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye (/ˈjɘmɘ/ /ˈqeg̃ɘ/ [pregnant] [coral]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Dore'eailonCounty.html">Dore'eailon County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye was founded by Vrimszeh, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye receives an average of 270 cm/y (106 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye covers an area of nearly 272 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5172 m (16968 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye was founded durring the early 11th century, by Vrimszeh. The establishment of Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive gravel streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The riverside city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye's exceptionaly well made fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>The center of Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye lost 206 people, 399 livestock, and 48 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 218, when members of Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular enemy war machine intact. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with the defense of the fortification against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Yêmê-qeg̈ê Ye's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

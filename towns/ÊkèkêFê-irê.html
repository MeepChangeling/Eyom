<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê (/fɘ/ /ˈirɘ/ [olive] [size; capacity]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/TëomjinènaZone.html">Tëomjinèna Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êkèkê Fê-irê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Fê-irê was founded by <a href="../people/Mlelë7pzcc3l0pd.html">Mlelë</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Êkèkê Fê-irê receives an average of 283 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Êkèkê Fê-irê covers an area of nearly 67 km<sup>2</sup> (26 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2198 m (7211 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1467, by Mlelë. The establishment of Êkèkê Fê-irê suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Fê-irê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê is was constructed arround several broad cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Êkèkê Fê-irê's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Êkèkê Fê-irê which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\AmoebaSwarm.html">Amoeba Swarm</a> near Êkèkê Fê-irê are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fê-irê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves ritual combat to channel Conjuration energies of tier 3 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Boke Ènsàkē (/ɛn/ /səc/ [athlete] [quiet; shy]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Qùkēi̊vRegion.html">Qùkēi̊v Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Ènsàkē is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Ènsàkē was founded by <a href="../people/Nrêbêm2fqacqn4uf.html">Nrêbêm</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Ènsàkē has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Boke Ènsàkē receives an average of 206 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Boke Ènsàkē covers an area of nearly 242 km<sup>2</sup> (96 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2248 m (7375 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Ènsàkē was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1534, by Nrêbêm. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Boke Ènsàkē was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Ènsàkē is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Ènsàkē is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Boke Ènsàkē's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Boke Ènsàkē has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Boke Ènsàkē ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Boke Ènsàkē as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Boke Ènsàkē's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Boke Ènsàkē there is no wind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Boke Ènsàkē is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Boke Ènsàkē was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Ènsàkē lost 130 people, 268 livestock, and 20 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 212, when members of Boke Ènsàkē's militia enacted an operation to fortify a particular mine. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with the defense of the mine against a siege, which ended in defeat for Boke Ènsàkē's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Boke Ènsàkē's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

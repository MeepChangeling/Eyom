<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Are Chyu̽ was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1446, by Shëgado. The establishment of Chyameya Are Chyu̽ suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Chyameya Are Chyu̽ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Are Chyu̽ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Are Chyu̽ is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious paverstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section.

The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Chyameya Are Chyu̽'s would-be-castle fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Chyameya Are Chyu̽ has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>
<p>Chyameya Are Chyu̽'s roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Chyameya Are Chyu̽ suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

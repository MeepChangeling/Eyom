<p>Qi̘v Sjèvènip (Sjèvè /nip/ [confidential] [linen]) is a tropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SpshztagíhgCounty.html">Spshztagíhg County</a>, <a href="../provences/MarshCouncil.html">Marsh Council</a>, within the <a href="../nations/TauranianUnitedProvinces.html">Tauranian United Provinces</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Sjèvènip is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Sjèvènip was founded by Thraaz Guynne, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Sjèvènip has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Qi̘v Sjèvènip receives an average of 306 cm/y (120 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qi̘v Sjèvènip covers an area of nearly 284 km<sup>2</sup> (113 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 926 m (3038 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Sjèvènip was founded durring the late 16th century in winter of the year 1465, by Thraaz Guynne. The establishment of Qi̘v Sjèvènip was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Thraaz Guynne struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qi̘v Sjèvènip as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Sjèvènip was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Sjèvènip is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Sjèvènip is buildings are arranged within a network of premissive baked earthen streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The mountain city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these cost-cutting-focused defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Qi̘v Sjèvènip shows Qi̘v Sjèvènip as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Qi̘v Sjèvènip places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Qi̘v Sjèvènip. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere. Local law enforcement may know all about them, but lack the strength to confront them and their paid or intimidated henchmen.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Sjèvènip's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Qi̘v Sjèvènip hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Qi̘v Sjèvènip was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qi̘v Sjèvènip lost 224 people, 100 livestock, and 50 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 215, when members of Qi̘v Sjèvènip's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular  spy, and ensure they remain out of enemy hands. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Qi̘v Sjèvènip's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qi̘v Sjèvènip's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

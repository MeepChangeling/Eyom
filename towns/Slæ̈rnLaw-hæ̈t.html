<p>The name Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t was founded by <a href="../people/Gîbêktg8ysxbj7.html">Gîbê</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1495, by Gîbê. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Gîbê struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a city of Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t's size could have. The city's well-designed, yet cheep are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

<p>Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t rainbows form quite often above the City.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t is known for its well built pedestrian paths, which include foot bridges to cross the main street at several high-traffic areas.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami granted the town a great harvest. One of Slæ̈rn Law-hæ̈t's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

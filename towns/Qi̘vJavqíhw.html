<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw (/ʤav/ /qɪ̞w/ [yacht] [short; low]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/DunsfordiaCommunity.html">Dunsfordia Community</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Javqíhw is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Javqíhw was founded by Hetrick Upjohn, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw has a yearly average temperature of 30°C (86°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Qi̘v Javqíhw receives an average of 228 cm/y (89 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qi̘v Javqíhw covers an area of nearly 424 km<sup>2</sup> (169 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3322 m (10898 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1305, by Hetrick Upjohn. The establishment of Qi̘v Javqíhw  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Qi̘v Javqíhw's construction back out of the project. Hetrick Upjohn pushed on reguardles, and Qi̘v Javqíhw was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Javqíhw is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The would-be-castle fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Qi̘v Javqíhw ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. In spite of the Galvanic Grid, these lights continue to use their old fule sources to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items.

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Qi̘v Javqíhw's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SpiderSkull(Tiny).html">Spider, Skull (Tiny)</a> near Qi̘v Javqíhw are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Abjuration energies of tier 3 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Javqíhw's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Qi̘v Javqíhw suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami spared the town from an attack. One of Qi̘v Javqíhw's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

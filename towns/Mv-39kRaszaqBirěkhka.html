<p>The name Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka was founded by <a href="../people/Vz-46vTrentÊrí8dvjtci6rh.html">Vz-46v 'Trent' Êrí</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1417, by Vz-46v 'Trent' Êrí. The establishment of Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the town is well defended against anything short of an army. The town's cost-cutting-focused defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the town. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is recurring in Mv-39k Raszaq Birěkhka.</p>

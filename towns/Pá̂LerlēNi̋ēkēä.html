<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Pá̂ Lerlē Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1247, by Mbōr Cā́chvō̋ 'Calvin Bianca' Rē̌shvoī Mp̪vē Yawmē̋ch Vúó̄ Haw̄. The establishment of Pá̂ Lerlē Ni̋ēkēä suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Pá̂ Lerlē Ni̋ēkēä which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Pá̂ Lerlē Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Pá̂ Lerlē Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Pá̂ Lerlē Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Pá̂ Lerlē Ni̋ēkēä's exceptionaly well made fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Pá̂ Lerlē Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p>The name Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Sians947pr6fpw.html">Sian</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow receives an average of 71 cm/y (27 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow covers an area of nearly 47 km<sup>2</sup> (18 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 9820 m (-10731 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1304, by Sian. The establishment of Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Sian struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow is buildings are built arround a single restrictive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by grandeur of scale, simplicity of geometric forms, dramatic use of columns, and a preference for blank walls. This design ethos extended to re-imagining earlier styles of structure to create them anew, with a similar overall look and feel to one another..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is skipped in Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow.</p>

<p>Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 2 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow was attacked by a group of guerrilla fighters. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow lost 133 people, 106 livestock, and 82 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 176, when members of Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the fortification, which ended in defeat for Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nove̜n Ne̜ Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

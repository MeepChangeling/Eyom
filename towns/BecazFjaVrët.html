<p>Becaz Fja Vrët (/ˈbecaz/ /fja/ [guilty] [need]) is a subtropical Small Town located in the <a href="../provences/BrotlëftavremōfMoot.html">Brotlëftavremōf Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Becaz Fja Vrët is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Becaz Fja Vrët was founded by <a href="../people/FireCrabsTumroduuf6h83qpvi.html">Fire Crabs Tumrodu</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Becaz Fja Vrët has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F). Becaz Fja Vrët receives an average of 148 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Becaz Fja Vrët covers an area of nearly 3 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3372 m (11062 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Becaz Fja Vrët was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1120, by Fire Crabs Tumrodu. The establishment of Becaz Fja Vrët was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Fire Crabs Tumrodu struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Becaz Fja Vrët as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Becaz Fja Vrët was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Becaz Fja Vrët is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Becaz Fja Vrët is buildings are built arround a single crampt packed earth mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the town a over all circular shape. The  town is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a town of Becaz Fja Vrët's size could have. Becaz Fja Vrët's well-designed, yet cheep are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Becaz Fja Vrët has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Becaz Fja Vrët long.</p>

These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Becaz Fja Vrët's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

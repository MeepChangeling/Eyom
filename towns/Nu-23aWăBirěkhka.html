<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nu-23a Wă Birěkhka was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1094, by Êbênm Brêrêtco. The establishment of Nu-23a Wă Birěkhka was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Êbênm Brêrêtco struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Nu-23a Wă Birěkhka as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Nu-23a Wă Birěkhka was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nu-23a Wă Birěkhka is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nu-23a Wă Birěkhka is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive paverstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the town's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive.

Nu-23a Wă Birěkhka's top tier civilian fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected...

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Mere Baikal began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which was isolated to the area around Nu-23a Wă Birěkhka, which was swallowed by the fumes for several days. Nu-23a Wă Birěkhka lost 285 people, 156 livestock, and 84 buildings in the disaster, though it is of note the local plant life flourished after the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Calamity Wind.</p>

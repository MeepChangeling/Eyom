<p>The name Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg was founded by <a href="../people/Kongxjjpgt4nta.html">Kong</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 16°C (60°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -2°C (29°F). Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg receives an average of 230 cm/y (90 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg covers an area of nearly 30 km<sup>2</sup> (12 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5050 m (16568 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1438, by Kong. The establishment of Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The perhapse unnessisarily well built defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg’s streets. A look around Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg long.</p>

<p>Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is recurring in Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg lost 134 people, 100 livestock, and 37 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 115, when members of Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Slæ̈rn ánjim-deg's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

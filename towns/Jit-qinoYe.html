<p>Jit-qino Ye (/ˈfënɘ/ /ˈqino/ [tight; tense; firm; narrow] [chef; cook]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MyuegrothCounty.html">Myuegroth County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jit-qino Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Jit-qino Ye was founded by Tshêv, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jit-qino Ye has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Jit-qino Ye receives an average of 220 cm/y (86 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Jit-qino Ye covers an area of nearly 267 km<sup>2</sup> (106 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1460 m (4790 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jit-qino Ye was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1272, by Tshêv. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Tshêv.</p>
<p>Jit-qino Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jit-qino Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Jit-qino Ye is buildings are speckled and packed arround premissive paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The lakeside city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Jit-qino Ye's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Jit-qino Ye has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Jit-qino Ye long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Jit-qino Ye is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness.

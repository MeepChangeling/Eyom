<p>Copperster (/ˈkɒpə/ /ster/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/HighwynDutchy.html">Highwyn Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/KihulCounty.html">Kihul County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Copperster is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Copperster was founded by Pa Hanbury Pattison, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Copperster has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Copperster receives an average of 259 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Copperster covers an area of nearly 276 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1386 m (4547 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Copperster was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1337, by Pa Hanbury Pattison. The establishment of Copperster  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Copperster's construction back out of the project. Pa Hanbury Pattison pushed on reguardles, and Copperster was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Copperster was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Copperster is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Copperster is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive flagstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The riverside city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Copperster's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Copperster's unusual though effective defenses has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Copperster has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Copperster long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Copperster's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Copperster rainbows form quite often above the Large City.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Bucktown (/bʌk/ /taʊn/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/GreengoldDutchy.html">Greengold Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/ShoverleyCounty.html">Shoverley County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bucktown is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Bucktown was founded by Giant Maggots Power, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bucktown has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Bucktown receives an average of 212 cm/y (83 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Bucktown covers an area of nearly 271 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8470 m (-15160 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bucktown was founded durring the late 11th century, by Giant Maggots Power. The establishment of Bucktown suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Bucktown which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Bucktown was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bucktown is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bucktown is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive flagstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The valley city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Bucktown has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Bucktown long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Bucktown's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is long in Bucktown.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

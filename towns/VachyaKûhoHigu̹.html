<p>The name Vachya Kûho Higu̹ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Vachya Kûho Higu̹ was founded by <a href="../people/Glkeshëmyt0lgvhn2w.html">Glkeshëm</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vachya Kûho Higu̹ was founded durring the late 18th century in early fall of the year 1686, by Glkeshëm. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Glkeshëm.</p>
<p>Vachya Kûho Higu̹ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vachya Kûho Higu̹ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vachya Kûho Higu̹ is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Vachya Kûho Higu̹, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Vachya Kûho Higu̹ makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye.</p>

The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Vachya Kûho Higu̹ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Vachya Kûho Higu̹. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Vachya Kûho Higu̹ lost 257 people, 280 livestock, and 72 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 82, when members of Vachya Kûho Higu̹'s militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a stalemate for Vachya Kûho Higu̹'s forces. The war is remembered in legend by Vachya Kûho Higu̹'s bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

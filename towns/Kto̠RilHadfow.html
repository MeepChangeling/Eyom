<p>Kto̠ Ril Hadfow (/kto̠/ /ril/ [thin (narrow)] [heaven; paradise]) is a subtropical Small City located in the <a href="../provences/NënchyënMoot.html">Nënchyën Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kto̠ Ril Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kto̠ Ril Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Thonconfkyy7xf21.html">Thonco</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kto̠ Ril Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 1°C (33°F). Kto̠ Ril Hadfow receives an average of 149 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kto̠ Ril Hadfow covers an area of nearly 15 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2932 m (9619 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kto̠ Ril Hadfow was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1442, by Thonco. The establishment of Kto̠ Ril Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Thonco struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Kto̠ Ril Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Kto̠ Ril Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kto̠ Ril Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brick construction taking the shape of large simple gemometric shapes which ate then embelished with decorative features, but retain their simple shapes in spite of the added features such as pillars, faccaddes, and covered walkways. The blocky nature gives a general impression of extreem age, as if each structure has existed since time immemorial.</p>
<p>Kto̠ Ril Hadfow is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt paverstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The exceptionaly well made fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Kto̠ Ril Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kto̠ Ril Hadfow long.</p>

<p>Kto̠ Ril Hadfow's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

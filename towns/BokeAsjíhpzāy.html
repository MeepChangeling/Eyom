<p>Boke Asjíhpzāy (/ˈasjɪ̞p/ /zəˑj/ [metro] [deep]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kririsi̊mùRegion.html">Kririsi̊mù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Asjíhpzāy is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Asjíhpzāy was founded by <a href="../people/Gilê4cqzzdhfmd.html">Gilê</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Asjíhpzāy has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Boke Asjíhpzāy receives an average of 195 cm/y (76 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Boke Asjíhpzāy covers an area of nearly 120 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2786 m (9140 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Asjíhpzāy was founded durring the late 17th century in early winter of the year 1595, by Gilê. The establishment of Boke Asjíhpzāy suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Boke Asjíhpzāy which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Boke Asjíhpzāy was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Asjíhpzāy is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Asjíhpzāy is buildings are built arround a single broad flagstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Boke Asjíhpzāy's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Boke Asjíhpzāy's political statment focused walls has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Asjíhpzāy has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Boke Asjíhpzāy long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Boke Asjíhpzāy's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Boke Asjíhpzāy tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Boke Asjíhpzāy's residents established a new industry 5 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>

<p>The name Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq was founded by <a href="../people/Tseliniljd3hrwy.html">Tseli</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1336, by Tseli. The establishment of Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq's would-be-castle fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lilgap Fj-41n Khǐq long.</p>

<p>The name Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Khêbel18sfrixbjx.html">Khêbel</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya covers an area of nearly 174 km<sup>2</sup> (69 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1602 m (5255 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya was founded durring the early 11th century, by Khêbel. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Khêbel.</p>
<p>Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya is buildings folow an organic layout of crampt packed earth streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya shows Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Kiyu Lûdû Gûchya rainbows form quite often above the Large City.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

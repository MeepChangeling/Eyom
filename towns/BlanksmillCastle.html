<p>The name Blanksmill Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Blanksmill Castle was founded by <a href="../people/KelëiBerensonRobbins1iliy5r845.html">Kelëi Berenson Robbins</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Blanksmill Castle has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F).

Blanksmill Castle covers an area of nearly 121 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5052 m (16574 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Blanksmill Castle was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1389, by Kelëi Berenson Robbins. The establishment of Blanksmill Castle was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Kelëi Berenson Robbins electing to pay people to resettle in Blanksmill Castle.</p>
<p>Blanksmill Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Blanksmill Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Blanksmill Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of narrow gravel streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these brittle defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Blanksmill Castle is a bustling hive of activity. Everyone moves at nothing short of a jog, each convocation is a mile a minute, and there’s dedicated lanes for riding through town in the center of each street. The locals all appear to be not merely occupied, but in a true hurry for everything from drinking a pint of ale to their daily work.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Blanksmill Castle's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Blanksmill Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Blanksmill Castle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Ovinnik.html">Ovinnik</a> near Blanksmill Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Blanksmill Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves consuming a local narcotic to channel Charm energies of tier 1 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century an up-welling of water from beneath the earth caused Creek Haven to surge and overflow its banks. The resulting flood was isolated to the area around Blanksmill Castle, which was swallowed by the waters for several days. Blanksmill Castle lost 238 people, 324 livestock, and 69 buildings in the disaster. The disaster is remembered as the Suffering Drownings.</p>

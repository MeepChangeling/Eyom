<p>The name Medland Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Medland Castle was founded by <a href="../people/GawmMp̪fēDollPieRa̋ńchGä̋chvēVú̄kīnḱCookeu8p4ggqj1h.html">Gawm Mp̪fē 'Doll Pie' Ra̋ńch Gä̋chvē Vú̄kīnḱ Cooke</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Medland Castle was founded durring the early 10th century, by Gawm Mp̪fē 'Doll Pie' Ra̋ńch Gä̋chvē Vú̄kīnḱ Cooke. The establishment of Medland Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Medland Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Medland Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Medland Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Medland Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive paverstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Astonishigly, the would-be-castle fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Medland Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Medland Castle is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Medland Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>In Medland Castle every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

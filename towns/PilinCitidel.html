<p>Pilin Citidel (/spittal/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BeachholtDutchy.html">Beachholt Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/NefanKingdom.html">Nefan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Pilin Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Pilin Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/GèsèbMacAuleyDevinenb4mmkt9s2.html">Gèsèb MacAuley Devine</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Pilin Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Pilin Citidel receives an average of 218 cm/y (85 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Pilin Citidel covers an area of nearly 199 km<sup>2</sup> (79 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2566 m (8418 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Pilin Citidel was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1419, by Gèsèb MacAuley Devine. The establishment of Pilin Citidel was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Gèsèb MacAuley Devine electing to pay people to resettle in Pilin Citidel.</p>
<p>Pilin Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Pilin Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Pilin Citidel is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious flagstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Pilin Citidel's failry decent fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Pilin Citidel has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Pilin Citidel ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Pilin Citidel might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Pilin Citidel's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is short in Pilin Citidel.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\CloudDragonWyrmling.html">Cloud Dragon, Wyrmling</a> near Pilin Citidel are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Pilin Citidel's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves bloodletting to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 2 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

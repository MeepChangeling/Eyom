<p>Boke Hi̊glāj (/hi̘g/ /ləˑj/ [player] [comic]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FtiyāobātRegion.html">Ftiyāobāt Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Hi̊glāj is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Hi̊glāj was founded by <a href="../people/Zlèsêlwy5qsfmf91.html">Zlèsêl</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Hi̊glāj has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Boke Hi̊glāj receives an average of 278 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Hi̊glāj covers an area of nearly 214 km<sup>2</sup> (85 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5158 m (16922 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Hi̊glāj was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1453, by Zlèsêl. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Zlèsêl.</p>
<p>Boke Hi̊glāj was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Hi̊glāj is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Boke Hi̊glāj is buildings folow an organic layout of premissive cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Boke Hi̊glāj's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Boke Hi̊glāj's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Hi̊glāj gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Boke Hi̊glāj might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Boke Hi̊glāj's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Boke Hi̊glāj most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

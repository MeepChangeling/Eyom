<p>Amberette (/ˈæmbə/ /ette/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SkvupokrtpdoqoleDutchy.html">Skvupokrtpdoqole Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/RetfordCounty.html">Retford County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Amberette is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Amberette was founded by Zrugru Brtheg̈ Foote, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Amberette has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Amberette receives an average of 100 cm/y (39 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Amberette covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 10244 m (-9340 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Amberette was founded durring the late 16th century in summer of the year 1468, by Zrugru Brtheg̈ Foote. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Zrugru Brtheg̈ Foote.</p>
<p>Amberette was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Amberette is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Amberette is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The hillside city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Amberette's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Amberette has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Amberette’s streets. Yet, deep down, you know this atmosphere is a carefully created illusion. You can see the ocasional seam in their tapestry. You’re not sure what has them doing their best to act so carefree, but act carefree they do.</p>

<p>Amberette's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Amberette every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>The center of Amberette's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Amberette's residents established a new industry (5454 % 6)+1 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami solved a major long term problem plaguing the town. One of Amberette's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

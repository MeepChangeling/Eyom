<p>The name Ëlê-la Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ëlê-la Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Alagwen4d6iwrwjv5.html">Alagwen</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ëlê-la Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Ëlê-la Ratê receives an average of 276 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ëlê-la Ratê covers an area of nearly 148 km<sup>2</sup> (59 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1292 m (4238 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ëlê-la Ratê was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1530, by Alagwen. The establishment of Ëlê-la Ratê  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ëlê-la Ratê's construction back out of the project. Alagwen pushed on reguardles, and Ëlê-la Ratê was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ëlê-la Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ëlê-la Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ëlê-la Ratê is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow canals streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Ëlê-la Ratê, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Ëlê-la Ratê's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Ëlê-la Ratê has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Ëlê-la Ratê’s streets. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as relaxing. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p>Ëlê-la Ratê's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Ëlê-la Ratê was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>Ëlê-la Ratê's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Ëlê-la Ratê suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<p>The name Cound Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Cound Castle was founded by <a href="../people/MarysBencen8q7md10hn.html">Marys Bence</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Cound Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cound Castle was founded durring the late 10th century, by Marys Bence. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Cound Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cound Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Cound Castle is is constructed  arround a series of broad cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Cound Castle has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Cound Castle, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Cound Castle is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 6 years has greatly spiked Cound Castle's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> spared the town from an attack. One of Cound Castle's festivals remembers the hero.</p>

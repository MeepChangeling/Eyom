<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka (/wɛn/ /ˈmezax/ [tall] [post]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/DewlǐqDistrict.html">Dewlǐq District</a> of the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka was founded by <a href="../people/TaraTrthênme2bqbx0rvww.html">Tara Trthênme</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka was founded durring the early 11th century, by Tara Trthênme. The establishment of Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka is was constructed arround several spacious flagstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka's would-be-castle fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the town as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the town nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the town, particularly the market.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka's parks.</p>

<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Alseid.html">Alseid</a> near Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Ip-31y Mezakh Birěkhka's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves orgies to channel Necromancy energies of tier 2 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

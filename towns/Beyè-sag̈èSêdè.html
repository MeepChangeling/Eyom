<p>Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè (/ˈbejè/ /ˈsag̃è/ [perfect] [peach]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FîthdekîZone.html">Fîthdekî Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè was founded by <a href="../people/Theddu49qw7vuzth.html">Theddu</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè receives an average of 261 cm/y (102 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè covers an area of nearly 78 km<sup>2</sup> (31 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1408 m (4619 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1190, by Theddu. The establishment of Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Theddu struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè's top tier civilian fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere. Local law enforcement may know all about them, but lack the strength to confront them and their paid or intimidated henchmen.</p>
<p>Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè grains of dust blow into perfectly neat rows.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè lost 213 people, 122 livestock, and 78 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 151, when members of Beyè-sag̈è Sêdè's militia enacted an operation to recruit a particular irregulars group. The operation was complicated by a natural disaster interrupted the operation, shattering unit cohesion.

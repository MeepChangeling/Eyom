<p>Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi (/ˈdèdɘ/ /ˈʤɘθi/ [pink] [comment]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/IletsksmamaZone.html">Iletsksmama Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi was founded by <a href="../people/Khèsês88qpth12t.html">Khèsê</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi receives an average of 74 cm/y (29 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi covers an area of nearly 126 km<sup>2</sup> (50 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7472 m (-18435 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1361, by Khèsê. The establishment of Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi is buildings have been located at convienant points along the hill Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the premissive flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by order, symmetry, formal design, grandiosity, and elaborate ornamentation. Architectural characteristics include balustrades, balconies, columns, cornices, pilasters, and triangular pediments. Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. Interiors will often have a grand stairway and opulent ballroom..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Yothga.html">Yothga</a> near Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Êkèkê G̈cës-jêthi's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves bloodletting to channel Charm energies of tier 1 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow (/kle̜/ /ˈinɛw/ [mint] [morning; dawn; birth]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SkrungzkuiusaZone.html">Skrungzkuiusa Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/KisujemapaDistrict.html">Kisujemapa District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Alveria.html">Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Brelèbdsqlgxrz58.html">Brelèb</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow receives an average of 72 cm/y (28 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow covers an area of nearly 103 km<sup>2</sup> (41 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3932 m (12900 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1303, by Brelèb. The establishment of Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow is buildings are speckled and packed arround broad cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow's political statment focused walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>

<p>Kle̜ Inëw Hadfow was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>

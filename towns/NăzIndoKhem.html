<p>The name Năz Indo Khem is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Năz Indo Khem was founded by <a href="../people/Vurreiac8ditlc9m.html">Vurrei</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>

<p>Năz Indo Khem was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1253, by Vurrei. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Vurrei.</p>
<p>Năz Indo Khem was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Năz Indo Khem is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Năz Indo Khem is buildings folow an organic layout of crampt baked earthen streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Năz Indo Khem, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Năz Indo Khem's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Năz Indo Khem's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Năz Indo Khem hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Năz Indo Khem is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>Năz Indo Khem's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Năz Indo Khem suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami ended a famine plaguing Năz Indo Khem. One of Năz Indo Khem's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<p>Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya (/mʊˈjiho/ /ˈʊni/ [demographic] [rule (law; regulation); law]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GlikérádPrincipality.html">Glikérád Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Saborri.html">Saborri</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Bovriam4v2qy2c9d.html">Bovria</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -11°C (13°F). Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya receives an average of 282 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2374 m (7788 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1192, by Bovria. The establishment of Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya is was constructed arround several premissive paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these brittle defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Xtabay.html">Xtabay</a> near Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves ritual combat to channel Illusion energies of tier 2 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami granted the town a great harvest. One of Mûyiho Ûni Gûchya's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

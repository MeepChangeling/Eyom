<p>Qi̘v àdigfíhb (/ˈədig/ /fɪ̞b/ [squirrel] [white; blank; clear]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Ti̊hufíhCounty.html">Ti̊hufíh County</a>, <a href="../provences/BotburyShire.html">Botbury Shire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v àdigfíhb is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v àdigfíhb was founded by Dyèdonmë Lloyd, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v àdigfíhb has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Qi̘v àdigfíhb receives an average of 227 cm/y (89 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qi̘v àdigfíhb covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1952 m (6404 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v àdigfíhb was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1288, by Dyèdonmë Lloyd. The establishment of Qi̘v àdigfíhb suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Qi̘v àdigfíhb which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Qi̘v àdigfíhb was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v àdigfíhb is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qi̘v àdigfíhb is buildings are arranged arround a single broad baked earthen mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The lakeside city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Qi̘v àdigfíhb's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Qi̘v àdigfíhb's unusual though effective defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Qi̘v àdigfíhb hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p>Qi̘v àdigfíhb's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<p>Kad Yutsïght-drew (/jutˈsɪxt/ /drew/ [deep] [hip]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GïtarejéPrincipality.html">Gïtarejé Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Nasdi.html">Nasdi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Yutsïght-drew is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Yutsïght-drew was founded by <a href="../people/FalseSpiders1sl99pblqg.html">False Spiders</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Yutsïght-drew has a yearly average temperature of -1°C (31°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -25°C (-13°F). Kad Yutsïght-drew receives an average of 252 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kad Yutsïght-drew covers an area of nearly 181 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3102 m (10177 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Yutsïght-drew was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1406, by False Spiders. The establishment of Kad Yutsïght-drew suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Kad Yutsïght-drew was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Yutsïght-drew is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kad Yutsïght-drew is buildings are arranged within a network of spacious paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Kad Yutsïght-drew, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Yutsïght-drew has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kad Yutsïght-drew long.</p>

<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy.

No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>

It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>

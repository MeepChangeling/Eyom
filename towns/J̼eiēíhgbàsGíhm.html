<p>J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm (/ˈj̼ejɪ̞g/ /bəs/ [chef; cook] [brown]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MàvēvāvRegion.html">Màvēvāv Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Grubugaersqhpm5sdtq.html">Grubugaer</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm receives an average of 177 cm/y (69 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm covers an area of nearly 150 km<sup>2</sup> (60 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3558 m (11673 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1170, by Grubugaer. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Grubugaer.</p>
<p>J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm is was constructed arround several narrow cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 2 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm was attacked by savage tribes living nearby J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm lost 200 people, 204 livestock, and 35 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 181, when members of J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific war supplies to a particular strategic location unharmed. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by J̼eiēíhgbàs Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

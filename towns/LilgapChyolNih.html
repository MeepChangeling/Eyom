<p>Lilgap Chyol Nih (/col/ /nih/ [gorgeous; handsome] [harbor]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/IqalakaZone.html">Iqalaka Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/KoseniluDistrict.html">Kosenilu District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Alveria.html">Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lilgap Chyol Nih is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lilgap Chyol Nih was founded by <a href="../people/Shèsêvu5rs5gqx4q.html">Shèsêv</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lilgap Chyol Nih has a yearly average temperature of 34°C (93°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 38°C (100°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a hot 31°C (87°F). Lilgap Chyol Nih receives an average of 67 cm/y (26 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lilgap Chyol Nih covers an area of nearly 84 km<sup>2</sup> (33 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 13390 m (980 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lilgap Chyol Nih was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1259, by Shèsêv. The establishment of Lilgap Chyol Nih suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Lilgap Chyol Nih was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilgap Chyol Nih is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Lilgap Chyol Nih is buildings are arranged arround a single premissive flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Lilgap Chyol Nih's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Lilgap Chyol Nih has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lilgap Chyol Nih long.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Lilgap Chyol Nih used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 6 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Lilgap Chyol Nih was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lilgap Chyol Nih lost 134 people, 290 livestock, and 72 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 160, when members of Lilgap Chyol Nih's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about a particular ruin. The operation was complicated by blistering heat, such that many succumbed to heatstroke. The conflict ended with the defense of the ruin against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Lilgap Chyol Nih's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lilgap Chyol Nih's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mochyî Kûlî Mudâ was founded durring the late 10th century, by Ethral. The establishment of Mochyî Kûlî Mudâ suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Mochyî Kûlî Mudâ which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Mochyî Kûlî Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mochyî Kûlî Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Mochyî Kûlî Mudâ is buildings are located arround a single premissive baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The lakeside city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Mochyî Kûlî Mudâ's cost-cutting-focused defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Mochyî Kûlî Mudâ seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>The name Nutscale Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nutscale Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/NrëdFeaseya5dawtv3hq.html">Nrëd Feasey</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nutscale Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F).

Nutscale Citidel covers an area of nearly 190 km<sup>2</sup> (76 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3502 m (11489 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nutscale Citidel was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1175, by Nrëd Feasey. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Nrëd Feasey.</p>
<p>Nutscale Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nutscale Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nutscale Citidel is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive flagstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The robustly designed timber walls has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Nutscale Citidel is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

<p>Nutscale Citidel's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 6 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Nutscale Citidel was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nutscale Citidel lost 240 people, 160 livestock, and 87 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 192, when members of Nutscale Citidel's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the prison, which ended in victory for Nutscale Citidel's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nutscale Citidel's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

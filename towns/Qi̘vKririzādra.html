<p>Qi̘v Kririzādra (Kririz /ˈəˑdra/ [sap] [sword]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SherskirkCommunity.html">Sherskirk Community</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Kririzādra is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Kririzādra was founded by Cú̄kīy Ha̋chīb 'Belle Aura' Mb̪vé̄r Sénvër Gä̂ Cadwaladr Víhgā, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Kririzādra has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Qi̘v Kririzādra receives an average of 269 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qi̘v Kririzādra covers an area of nearly 276 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1580 m (5183 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Kririzādra was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1147, by Cú̄kīy Ha̋chīb 'Belle Aura' Mb̪vé̄r Sénvër Gä̂ Cadwaladr Víhgā. The establishment of Qi̘v Kririzādra  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Qi̘v Kririzādra's construction back out of the project. Cú̄kīy Ha̋chīb 'Belle Aura' Mb̪vé̄r Sénvër Gä̂ Cadwaladr Víhgā pushed on reguardles, and Qi̘v Kririzādra was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Kririzādra was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Kririzādra is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Kririzādra is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow cobblestone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Qi̘v Kririzādra's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual though effective defenses are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Kririzādra is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. There’s a patern to the panic. It’s not easy to see, and no one quite agrees on what it is, but the locals know and operate under this pattern. It shapes everything they do, and you feel as if you’ve almost worked it out only for some small detail to devastate your theory every time you try and comprehend it.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<p>Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v (Ftsv /gej̼/ [seaweed] [candidate]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NijhobbubRegion.html">Nijhobbub Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Karynldfrubfi76.html">Karyn</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 190 km<sup>2</sup> (76 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 500 m (1640 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1143, by Karyn. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious split-log ties streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Ftsvgej̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

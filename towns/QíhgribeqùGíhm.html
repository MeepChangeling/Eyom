<p>Qíhgribeqù Gíhm (/qɪ̞g/ /riˈbeqʊ/ [posture (bodily position)] [golden]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kririsi̊mùRegion.html">Kririsi̊mù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qíhgribeqù Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qíhgribeqù Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Tsèj1qg6z4fxjj.html">Tsèj</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qíhgribeqù Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Qíhgribeqù Gíhm receives an average of 289 cm/y (113 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qíhgribeqù Gíhm covers an area of nearly 96 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1660 m (5446 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qíhgribeqù Gíhm was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1160, by Tsèj. The establishment of Qíhgribeqù Gíhm suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Qíhgribeqù Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qíhgribeqù Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qíhgribeqù Gíhm is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Qíhgribeqù Gíhm's robustly designed timber walls are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Qíhgribeqù Gíhm hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>

<p>Qíhgribeqù Gíhm's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>=In Qíhgribeqù Gíhm when drawing, it's impossible to draw an imperfect circle.</p>

<p>Qíhgribeqù Gíhm has access to some sort of functioning ancient infrastructure, whether it's an array of wall-mounted arcane energy projectors, running water, moving roadways, community-wide climate control, or some other inherited luxury. This infrastructure may be the result of a still-functional Working, or it could be the product of some venerable occult engine that's still operational, or it may be the fruit of the labors of some specially-designed organism or Blighted populace.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Qíhgribeqù Gíhm was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Qíhgribeqù Gíhm. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qíhgribeqù Gíhm lost 260 people, 367 livestock, and 99 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 126, when members of Qíhgribeqù Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to rescue a specific  spy from the enemy. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the fortification, which ended in victory for Qíhgribeqù Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qíhgribeqù Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

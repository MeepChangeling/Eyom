<p>Brock Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Brock Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Brock Castle is buildings are located arround a single spacious paverstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape.

<p>Noge̜ Wif Med (/ˈnoge̜/ /wif/ [ironic] [constellation]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/O'tarCounty.html">O'tar County</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Noge̜ Wif Med is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Noge̜ Wif Med was founded by <a href="../people/TheyKhunromudDhandosmxlw9cbpk.html">They Khunromud Dhando</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Noge̜ Wif Med has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Noge̜ Wif Med receives an average of 149 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Noge̜ Wif Med covers an area of nearly 435 km<sup>2</sup> (174 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4342 m (14245 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Noge̜ Wif Med was founded durring the early 17th century in early winter of the year 1617, by They Khunromud Dhando. The establishment of Noge̜ Wif Med was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to They Khunromud Dhando electing to pay people to resettle in Noge̜ Wif Med.</p>
<p>Noge̜ Wif Med was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Noge̜ Wif Med is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Noge̜ Wif Med is was constructed arround several restrictive flagstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Noge̜ Wif Med, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Noge̜ Wif Med makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Noge̜ Wif Med is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Noge̜ Wif Med's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Noge̜ Wif Med suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Noge̜ Wif Med was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Noge̜ Wif Med lost 254 people, 283 livestock, and 45 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 203, when members of Noge̜ Wif Med's militia enacted an operation to extract assets from a depot under siege by the enemy. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with the defense of the depot against a siege, which ended in victory for Noge̜ Wif Med's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Noge̜ Wif Med's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

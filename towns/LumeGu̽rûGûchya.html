<p>The name Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Thraazqmks9ipq53.html">Thraaz</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 13°C (55°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -3°C (27°F). Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya receives an average of 234 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1308 m (4291 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1364, by Thraaz. The establishment of Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Thraaz electing to pay people to resettle in Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya.</p>
<p>Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious worn bedrock streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya's would-be-castle fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya is home to some form of natural wonder. It could be a hot spring, or an especially enchanting glade, or a particular vista. Whatever it is, it's such a lovely attraction that Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya sees its fair share of tourists every year from all across Eyom. Consequently, its residents speak many languages at a functional level.</p>
<p>Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Lume Gu̽rû Gûchya suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

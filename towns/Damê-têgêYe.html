<p>Damê-têgê Ye (/ˈdamɘ/ /ˈtɘgɘ/ [society] [twilight]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ShemnasCounty.html">Shemnas County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Damê-têgê Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Damê-têgê Ye was founded by Ford, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Damê-têgê Ye has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Damê-têgê Ye receives an average of 263 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Damê-têgê Ye covers an area of nearly 276 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1562 m (5124 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Damê-têgê Ye was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1276, by Ford. The establishment of Damê-têgê Ye was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ford struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Damê-têgê Ye as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Damê-têgê Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Damê-têgê Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Damê-têgê Ye is is constructed arround a semi-circular narrow flagstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The valley city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Damê-têgê Ye's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Damê-têgê Ye hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Damê-têgê Ye's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Damê-têgê Ye birds speak prophesy.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Damê-têgê Ye’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Damê-têgê Ye’s streets.</p>
<p>The center of Damê-têgê Ye's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Sapiela Holt was struck by a drought when Lake Tana grew too small to continue feeding Brook Hudson, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Damê-têgê Ye. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Damê-têgê Ye lost 233 people, and 160 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 5 weeks, which are remembered as the Dread Thirst.</p>

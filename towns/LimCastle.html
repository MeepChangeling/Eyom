<p>Lim Castle (/lɪm/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/LandsilverDutchy.html">Landsilver Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MaganKingdom.html">Magan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lim Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lim Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TrîbmênmHinesu4789dxka5.html">Trîbmênm Hines</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lim Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Lim Castle receives an average of 286 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lim Castle covers an area of nearly 180 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2332 m (7650 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lim Castle was founded durring the early 17th century in early summer of the year 1642, by Trîbmênm Hines. The establishment of Lim Castle was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Trîbmênm Hines electing to pay people to resettle in Lim Castle.</p>
<p>Lim Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lim Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Lim Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of premissive paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these cost-cutting-focused defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Lim Castle has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lim Castle long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Lim Castle is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a most peculiar disaster struck Lim Castle, causing great chunks of ice to fall from the sky. Lim Castle lost 213 people, 263 livestock, and 60 buildings in the disaster.. The ice rain is generally remembered as the Torment Rain.</p>

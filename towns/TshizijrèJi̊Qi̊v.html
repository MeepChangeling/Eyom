<p>The name Tshizijrè Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tshizijrè Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Shonhëg̈sy9q6s9y4d.html">Shonhëg̈</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tshizijrè Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1236, by Shonhëg̈. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Shonhëg̈.</p>
<p>Tshizijrè Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tshizijrè Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Tshizijrè Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Tshizijrè Ji̊ Qi̊v's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Tshizijrè Ji̊ Qi̊v's top tier civilian fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>

<p>Qi̘v Zdievewbàd (Zdievew /bəd/ [casual] [vacuum (lack of air)]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HatbutondoCommunity.html">Hatbutondo Community</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Zdievewbàd is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Zdievewbàd was founded by Breg̈kèbm Fards Belíh, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Zdievewbàd has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Qi̘v Zdievewbàd receives an average of 289 cm/y (113 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qi̘v Zdievewbàd covers an area of nearly 271 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1080 m (3543 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Zdievewbàd was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1284, by Breg̈kèbm Fards Belíh. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Zdievewbàd was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Zdievewbàd is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Zdievewbàd is is constructed  arround a series of narrow paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The mountain city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Qi̘v Zdievewbàd, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Qi̘v Zdievewbàd hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Zdievewbàd is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Qi̘v Zdievewbàd was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qi̘v Zdievewbàd lost 227 people, 188 livestock, and 66 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 98, when members of Qi̘v Zdievewbàd's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Qi̘v Zdievewbàd's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qi̘v Zdievewbàd's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

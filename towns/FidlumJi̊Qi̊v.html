<p>The name Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Shèbefsk3u4fjn7.html">Shèbe</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 278 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 207 km<sup>2</sup> (82 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5458 m (17906 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1047, by Shèbe. The establishment of Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious worn bedrock streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual though effective defenses have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Fidlum Ji̊ Qi̊v is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

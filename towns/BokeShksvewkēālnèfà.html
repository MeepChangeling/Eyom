<p>Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà (Shksvew /cəˑlˈnɛfə/ [underwear] [guess]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NijhobbubRegion.html">Nijhobbub Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà was founded by <a href="../people/Sarcotorgldcyd4601.html">Sarcotor</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà has a yearly average temperature of 32°C (89°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 35°C (95°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 29°C (84°F). Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà receives an average of 277 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà covers an area of nearly 142 km<sup>2</sup> (56 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 302 m (990 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà was founded in time immemorial, reportedly some time durring the late 8th century, by Sarcotor. The establishment of Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà's construction back out of the project. Sarcotor pushed on reguardles, and Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 8th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà is is constructed  arround a series of spacious paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Astonishigly, the political statment focused walls are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà is like looking into a university’s plaza on the day before an exam. People rush about to-and-fro. Discarded scrolls and quills are dotted around  city. In spite of many locals discussing academic topics, there’s little sign of any organized groups for any of that talk. Infact, the city seems disordered in general with everything scattered helter skelter about.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà.</p>

<p>Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves creating small tokens to channel Summoning energies of tier 1 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà lost 274 people, 142 livestock, and 48 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 210, when members of Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by the enemy forces had far more numbers than estimated. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a crushing defeat for Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Boke Shksvewkēālnèfà's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Chyameya Mochyî Hochye (/ˈmocɪː/ /ˈhoce/ [polite] [prey]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GïpimuiptPrincipality.html">Gïpimuipt Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Acoli.html">Acoli</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chyameya Mochyî Hochye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Mochyî Hochye was founded by <a href="../people/Khît0jgx8ds7g.html">Khî</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyameya Mochyî Hochye has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -12°C (11°F). Chyameya Mochyî Hochye receives an average of 143 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Chyameya Mochyî Hochye covers an area of nearly 102 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6314 m (20715 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Mochyî Hochye was founded in time immemorial, reportedly some time durring the early 8th century, by Khî. The establishment of Chyameya Mochyî Hochye suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Chyameya Mochyî Hochye was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 8th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Mochyî Hochye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Mochyî Hochye is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive packed earth streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Chyameya Mochyî Hochye's cost-cutting-focused defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Chyameya Mochyî Hochye hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>

Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

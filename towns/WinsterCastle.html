<p>The name Winster Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Winster Castle was founded by <a href="../people/JóchGó̄BooNadiaCúnvoīHāstärVúrmbó̄Waddingham5cli7tmqup.html">Jóch Gó̄ 'Boo Nadia' Cúnvoī Hāstär Vúrmbó̄ Waddingham</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Winster Castle has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Winster Castle was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1350, by Jóch Gó̄ 'Boo Nadia' Cúnvoī Hāstär Vúrmbó̄ Waddingham. The establishment of Winster Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Winster Castle's construction back out of the project. Jóch Gó̄ 'Boo Nadia' Cúnvoī Hāstär Vúrmbó̄ Waddingham pushed on reguardles, and Winster Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Winster Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Winster Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Winster Castle is buildings are located arround a single broad cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The would-be-castle fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Winster Castle is like a look into a broken heart. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need. It’s not malicious. Heads are hung. Eyes are empty. Something truly horrible happened here once upon a time and the city never healed.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Winster Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Winster Castle is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>
<p>Winster Castle has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>

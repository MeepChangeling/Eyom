<p>Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v (/kug guj/ /nas/ [cauldron] [off white]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kririsi̊mùRegion.html">Kririsi̊mù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Meleamorpha21asw2arfp.html">Meleamorpha</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 160 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 139 km<sup>2</sup> (55 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4314 m (14153 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1076, by Meleamorpha. The establishment of Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are built arround a single spacious split-log ties mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Astonishigly, the boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kug Gujnas Ji̊ Qi̊v hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<p>Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v (Tshkshti /vav/ [drugstore] [bureaucracy]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kririsi̊mùRegion.html">Kririsi̊mù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Goůh́ijljz87kb5k.html">Goůh́i</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 262 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 100 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2234 m (7329 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 17th century in early fall of the year 1573, by Goůh́i. The establishment of Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Goůh́i struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Astonishigly, the boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It’s a quiet city filled with closed scriptoriums, people quietly yet dejectedly reading in isolated places around town, and the occasional book laying in a heap of garbage.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v was attacked by a slaver gang capable of fielding large forces. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v lost 136 people, 376 livestock, and 68 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 47, when members of Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to a particular strategic location, then reinforce it. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with the defense of the strategic location against a siege, which ended in victory for Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Tshkshtivav Ji̊ Qi̊v's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

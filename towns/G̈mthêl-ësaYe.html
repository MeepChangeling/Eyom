<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye (/ˈfèzɪ/ /ˈësa/ [stupid; dumb; silly] [niche]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/OnaselianCounty.html">Onaselian County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name G̈mthêl-ësa Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as G̈mthêl-ësa Ye was founded by Ktilêli, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). G̈mthêl-ësa Ye receives an average of 240 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. G̈mthêl-ësa Ye covers an area of nearly 268 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2036 m (6679 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1369, by Ktilêli. The establishment of G̈mthêl-ësa Ye  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding G̈mthêl-ësa Ye's construction back out of the project. Ktilêli pushed on reguardles, and G̈mthêl-ësa Ye was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and G̈mthêl-ësa Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The riverside city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of G̈mthêl-ësa Ye weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The budget focused millitary grade defenses have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows G̈mthêl-ësa Ye is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items. The library is open to the public, including the Aether Link.</p>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for G̈mthêl-ësa Ye's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In G̈mthêl-ësa Ye all of the cats speak in a dead language.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\FrogKiller(3pp).html">Frog, Killer (3pp)</a> near G̈mthêl-ësa Ye are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>G̈mthêl-ësa Ye's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Transmutation energies of tier 2 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, G̈mthêl-ësa Ye was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is G̈mthêl-ësa Ye lost 119 people, 259 livestock, and 94 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 195, when members of G̈mthêl-ësa Ye's militia enacted an operation to escort a specific  mage to a safe location. The operation was complicated by at least some of the intelligence related to the operation was incorrect. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for G̈mthêl-ësa Ye's forces.

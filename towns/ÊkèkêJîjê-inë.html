<p>The name Êkèkê Jîjê-inë is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Jîjê-inë was founded by <a href="../people/Sé̄nḱJó̄shAlyssaSpringMë̌Gā̄nḱRä̌ail76j8g0m.html">Sé̄nḱ Jó̄sh 'Alyssa Spring' Më̌ Gā̄nḱ Rä̌</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Jîjê-inë has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Êkèkê Jîjê-inë receives an average of 130 cm/y (51 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Êkèkê Jîjê-inë covers an area of nearly 204 km<sup>2</sup> (81 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4854 m (15925 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Jîjê-inë was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1424, by Sé̄nḱ Jó̄sh 'Alyssa Spring' Më̌ Gā̄nḱ Rä̌. The establishment of Êkèkê Jîjê-inë was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Sé̄nḱ Jó̄sh 'Alyssa Spring' Më̌ Gā̄nḱ Rä̌ struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Êkèkê Jîjê-inë as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jîjê-inë was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Jîjê-inë is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jîjê-inë is is constructed  arround a series of crampt cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Êkèkê Jîjê-inë's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jîjê-inë seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

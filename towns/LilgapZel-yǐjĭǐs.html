<p>The name Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs was founded by <a href="../people/Tshêpíu2g6nuvr3p.html">Tshêpí</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1106, by Tshêpí. The establishment of Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tshêpí struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs is is constructed  arround a series of broad paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs's unusual though effective defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job.

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 3 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs lost 288 people, 207 livestock, and 74 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 115, when members of Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs's militia enacted an operation to secure a particular vault to utilize it for a specific task. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Lilgap Zel-yǐjĭǐs's forces.

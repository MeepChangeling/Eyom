<p>The name Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd was founded by <a href="../people/Thedduktht1dy7tf.html">Theddu</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F). Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd receives an average of 107 cm/y (42 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1384, by Theddu. The establishment of Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Theddu struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious worn bedrock streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual though effective defenses are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Qÿhtvehb Cä Rewd brings to mind.</p>

Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

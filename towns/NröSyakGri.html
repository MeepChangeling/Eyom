<p>Nrö Syak Gri (/nro˞/ /sjak/ [important] [bead]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KrëchysnǟMoot.html">Krëchysnǟ Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nrö Syak Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Nrö Syak Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Tsëigvp1645hr7.html">Tsëi</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nrö Syak Gri has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -11°C (13°F). Nrö Syak Gri receives an average of 309 cm/y (121 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Nrö Syak Gri covers an area of nearly 95 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3692 m (12112 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nrö Syak Gri was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1365, by Tsëi. The establishment of Nrö Syak Gri was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tsëi struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Nrö Syak Gri as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Nrö Syak Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nrö Syak Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nrö Syak Gri is is constructed  arround a series of premissive cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Nrö Syak Gri weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Nrö Syak Gri has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Nrö Syak Gri ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Nrö Syak Gri is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Nrö Syak Gri long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Nrö Syak Gri's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Nrö Syak Gri rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>

<p>Nrö Syak Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Summoning energies of tier 3 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Nrö Syak Gri is uncommonly rich, not only for the gentry but for the common citizens as well. They may produce a valuable good, oversee precious resource extraction, have special economic favors from the ruler, or simply have inherited a vast body of infrastructure. Their neighbors likely view them with envy, and outside raiders and exploiters find them an ideal target.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Nrö Syak Gri is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

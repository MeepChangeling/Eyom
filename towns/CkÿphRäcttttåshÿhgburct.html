<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ckÿph Räctttt åshÿhgburct was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1107, by Shêyë Zachwafyul̄. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Räctttt åshÿhgburct was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ckÿph Räctttt åshÿhgburct is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Räctttt åshÿhgburct is buildings folow an organic layout of restrictive worn bedrock streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The valley city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Ckÿph Räctttt åshÿhgburct, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Räctttt åshÿhgburct has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Ckÿph Räctttt åshÿhgburct ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Ckÿph Räctttt åshÿhgburct is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ckÿph Räctttt åshÿhgburct long.</p>

<p>The name Wæm Sof Ěpǐp is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Wæm Sof Ěpǐp was founded by <a href="../people/BelegielTrgêbrthêu6w9pp5aqg.html">Belegiel Trgêbrthê</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp has a yearly average temperature of 33°C (91°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 37°C (98°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 30°C (86°F). Wæm Sof Ěpǐp receives an average of 68 cm/y (26 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Wæm Sof Ěpǐp covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 21118 m (-16614 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1214, by Belegiel Trgêbrthê. The establishment of Wæm Sof Ěpǐp suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wæm Sof Ěpǐp is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp is buildings have been located at convienant points along the lake Wæm Sof Ěpǐp was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive gravel streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Wæm Sof Ěpǐp's would-be-castle fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the town as needed.</p>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Wæm Sof Ěpǐp ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Wæm Sof Ěpǐp.

<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Wæm Sof Ěpǐp's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Wæm Sof Ěpǐp.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Howler.html">Howler</a> near Wæm Sof Ěpǐp are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Wæm Sof Ěpǐp's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Illusion energies of tier 1 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Loch Loveless began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which devastated , killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. An estimated  people,  livestock, and  buildings were lost to the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Anguish Wind.</p>

<p>The name Kōs Avdra Ro̠ Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kōs Avdra Ro̠ Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Phaeturazkz18hqpqd.html">Phaetura</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kōs Avdra Ro̠ Hadfow was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1094, by Phaetura. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Phaetura.</p>
<p>Kōs Avdra Ro̠ Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kōs Avdra Ro̠ Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kōs Avdra Ro̠ Hadfow is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Kōs Avdra Ro̠ Hadfow weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>

The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

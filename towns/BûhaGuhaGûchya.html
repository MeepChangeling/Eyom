<p>The name Bûha Guha Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Bûha Guha Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Holly86k6i6769z.html">Holly</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bûha Guha Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 9°C (48°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Bûha Guha Gûchya receives an average of 258 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Bûha Guha Gûchya covers an area of nearly 132 km<sup>2</sup> (52 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1030 m (3379 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bûha Guha Gûchya was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1333, by Holly. The establishment of Bûha Guha Gûchya was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Holly electing to pay people to resettle in Bûha Guha Gûchya.</p>
<p>Bûha Guha Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bûha Guha Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Bûha Guha Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt flagstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Bûha Guha Gûchya weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Bûha Guha Gûchya's budget focused millitary grade defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Bûha Guha Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Bûha Guha Gûchya long.</p>

<p>Bûha Guha Gûchya's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>

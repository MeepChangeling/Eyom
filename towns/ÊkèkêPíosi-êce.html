<p>The name Êkèkê Píosi-êce is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Píosi-êce was founded by <a href="../people/Haleyhx9a4xcdhh.html">Haley</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Píosi-êce was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1112, by Haley. The establishment of Êkèkê Píosi-êce suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Píosi-êce was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Píosi-êce is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Píosi-êce is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Êkèkê Píosi-êce's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Êkèkê Píosi-êce's unusual though effective defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Êkèkê Píosi-êce, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Píosi-êce was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Êkèkê Píosi-êce is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with good fortune for a year and a day. One of Êkèkê Píosi-êce's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

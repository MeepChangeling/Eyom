<p>Fï-puf Xluwuf (/xcid/ /puf/ [minor; mere; petty] [acid]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MididïleghiPrincipality.html">Mididïleghi Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Nutheli.html">Nutheli</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fï-puf Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Fï-puf Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Bhogneyll46idjpfu.html">Bhogney</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fï-puf Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 1°C (33°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant -24°C (-11°F). Fï-puf Xluwuf receives an average of 223 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Fï-puf Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 158 km<sup>2</sup> (63 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3552 m (11653 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fï-puf Xluwuf was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1376, by Bhogney. The establishment of Fï-puf Xluwuf was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Bhogney electing to pay people to resettle in Fï-puf Xluwuf.</p>
<p>Fï-puf Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fï-puf Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fï-puf Xluwuf is was constructed arround several broad split-log ties mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Fï-puf Xluwuf is like looking into a university’s plaza on the day before an exam. People rush about to-and-fro. Discarded scrolls and quills are dotted around  city. In spite of many locals discussing academic topics, there’s little sign of any organized groups for any of that talk. Infact, the city seems disordered in general with everything scattered helter skelter about.</p>

The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Fï-puf Xluwuf was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Fï-puf Xluwuf lost 283 people, 348 livestock, and 44 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 150, when members of Fï-puf Xluwuf's militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular bridge. The operation was complicated by the enemy setting up an ambush. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Fï-puf Xluwuf's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Fï-puf Xluwuf's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Rio-idi Ye (/ˈrio/ /ˈidi/ [green] [oyster]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HansaCanton.html">Hansa Canton</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Rio-idi Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Rio-idi Ye was founded by John, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Rio-idi Ye has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Rio-idi Ye receives an average of 258 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Rio-idi Ye covers an area of nearly 359 km<sup>2</sup> (143 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4418 m (14494 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rio-idi Ye was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1502, by John. The establishment of Rio-idi Ye was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed John struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Rio-idi Ye as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Rio-idi Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rio-idi Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Rio-idi Ye is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt split-log ties mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The mountain city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Rio-idi Ye's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Rio-idi Ye, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Rio-idi Ye is centered around a major pilgrimage site. This may be a religious location of importance to a major faith, or it may be a more secular institution that draws the traffic, like a famous academy or the remains of some wondrous ancient work. Considerable local tension likely exists over controlling the access to the site and maximizing the profits from foreign visitors.</p>
<p>Rio-idi Ye's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Rio-idi Ye suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> killed a tyrannical  who had controlled Rio-idi Ye for years. The recitation of the hero's story remains a popular tavern and fair tale.</p>

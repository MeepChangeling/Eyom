<p>The name Nozbö Zöm Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Nozbö Zöm Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Osabug4y1ixtxxw.html">Osabu</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nozbö Zöm Hadfow was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1282, by Osabu. The establishment of Nozbö Zöm Hadfow suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Nozbö Zöm Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nozbö Zöm Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nozbö Zöm Hadfow is buildings are located arround a single restrictive worn bedrock mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Nozbö Zöm Hadfow is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>

The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings.

Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Nozbö Zöm Hadfow was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Nozbö Zöm Hadfow. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nozbö Zöm Hadfow lost 152 people, 344 livestock, and 47 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 83, when members of Nozbö Zöm Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to eliminate a specific group of the enemy's forces. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the temple, which ended in victory for Nozbö Zöm Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nozbö Zöm Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

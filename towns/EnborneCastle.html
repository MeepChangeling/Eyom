<p>Enborne Castle (/enborne/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/MistedgeDutchy.html">Mistedge Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/NefanKingdom.html">Nefan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Enborne Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Enborne Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ZèsëBattong13ilnvudq.html">Zèsë Batton</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Enborne Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Enborne Castle receives an average of 172 cm/y (67 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Enborne Castle covers an area of nearly 141 km<sup>2</sup> (56 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2512 m (8241 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Enborne Castle was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1263, by Zèsë Batton. The establishment of Enborne Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Enborne Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Enborne Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Enborne Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of restrictive gravel streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Enborne Castle's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Unfortuantly, these boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Enborne Castle is a bustling hive of activity. Everyone moves at nothing short of a jog, each convocation is a mile a minute, and there’s dedicated lanes for riding through town in the center of each street. The locals all appear to be not merely occupied, but in a true hurry for everything from drinking a pint of ale to their daily work.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Enborne Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Enborne Castle every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿MudElementalLarge.html">﻿Mud Elemental, Large</a> near Enborne Castle are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Enborne Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves drinking to channel Abjuration energies of tier 3 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 4 years has greatly spiked Enborne Castle's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with wealth for a year and a day. One of Enborne Castle's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

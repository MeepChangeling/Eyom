<p>Sutton  (/ˈsʌtən / [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large Town located in <a href="../subprovences/AmjàvCounty.html">Amjàv County</a>, <a href="../provences/EmzadaKingdom.html">Emzada Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sutton  is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Sutton  was founded by <a href="../people/BrëgfêPegler8um5a3l40u.html">Brëgfê Pegler</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sutton  has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F). Sutton  receives an average of 148 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Sutton  covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4860 m (15944 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sutton  was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1210, by Brëgfê Pegler. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Sutton  was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sutton  is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Sutton  is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt carved bedrock streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Sutton 's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The town's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the towns defences.</p>
<p>A look around Sutton  has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Sutton  long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Sutton  has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Sutton . They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Sutton 's parks.</p>
<p>Sutton  has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Sutton .</p>
<p>Sutton  has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Sutton  has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Sutton  has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Sutton  has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Sutton 's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Sutton  possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large Town. Sutton 's grid is powered by a boiler and turbine based power plant.</p>
<p>Sutton 's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Sutton  has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Sutton 's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Sutton  has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Sutton  has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Sutton 's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Sutton  hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\PorcupineGiant.html">Porcupine, Giant</a> near Sutton  are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Sutton 's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves square dance to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 1 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Sutton ’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Sutton ’s streets.</p>
<p>Sutton  is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century heavy spring rains following an uncharacteristically dry year and a minor earthquake resulted in the collapse of the west face of Mount Trepidation. the landslide struck Sutton , and devastated the community. 296 people, 130 livestock, and 95 buildings were lost to the calamity. The disaster is recorded in history as Trepidation's Fall.</p>

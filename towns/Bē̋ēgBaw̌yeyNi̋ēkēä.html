<p>The name Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/TrtesíÈbrêgeg̈Trgaregaty8wrlj0un.html">Trtesí Èbrêgeg̈ Trgarega</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1295, by Trtesí Èbrêgeg̈ Trgarega. The establishment of Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä is was constructed arround several crampt packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types.

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä lost 218 people, 246 livestock, and 78 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 82, when members of Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to gain control of a particular bridge. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the bridge, which ended in defeat for Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Bē̋ēg Baw̌yey Ni̋ēkēä's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>The name Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Natsadni6xh71xp4.html">Natsad</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F).

Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 125 km<sup>2</sup> (50 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1092 m (3582 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1074, by Natsad. The establishment of Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Natsad struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are speckled and packed arround premissive split-log ties streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v's budget oriented are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Cíhwsa Kùgjokēāj̼ Ji̊ Qi̊v hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

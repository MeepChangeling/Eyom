<p>Wæm Vr-55n Rushem was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1103, by Anghara Dyegfe. The establishment of Wæm Vr-55n Rushem suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Wæm Vr-55n Rushem which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Wæm Vr-55n Rushem was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wæm Vr-55n Rushem is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Wæm Vr-55n Rushem is buildings have been located at convienant points along the cliff Wæm Vr-55n Rushem was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town lacks any defencive features, though certainly constructing even a simple fence or digging a ditch is at the forefront of the 's mind. At least, one would hope so.</p>
<p>A look around Wæm Vr-55n Rushem gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily.

A second look around Wæm Vr-55n Rushem makes it abundantly clear the town suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wæm Vr-55n Rushem's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Wæm Vr-55n Rushem there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>

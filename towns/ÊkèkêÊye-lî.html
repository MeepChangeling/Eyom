<p>The name Êkèkê Êye-lî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Êye-lî was founded by <a href="../people/Dargurnls180ij72r.html">Dargurn</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Êye-lî has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Êkèkê Êye-lî receives an average of 287 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Êkèkê Êye-lî covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1868 m (6128 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Êye-lî was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1156, by Dargurn. The establishment of Êkèkê Êye-lî  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Êkèkê Êye-lî's construction back out of the project. Dargurn pushed on reguardles, and Êkèkê Êye-lî was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Êye-lî was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Êye-lî is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Êye-lî is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt flagstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Unfortuantly, these would-be-castle fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Êkèkê Êye-lî seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Êye-lî's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Êkèkê Êye-lî.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Êye-lî used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Êkèkê Êye-lî.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with wealth for a year and a day. One of Êkèkê Êye-lî's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<p>Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v (Íhtíh /ˈlʊʤi̘/ [skirt] [army; military]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Qùkēi̊vRegion.html">Qùkēi̊v Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Garêgfesírhjfqikqzd.html">Garêgfesí</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 214 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 225 km<sup>2</sup> (90 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2138 m (7014 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 10th century, by Garêgfesí. The establishment of Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v's construction back out of the project. Garêgfesí pushed on reguardles, and Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive baked earthen streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\GuardianGraven.html">Guardian, Graven</a> near Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves drinking to channel Abjuration energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 5 years has greatly spiked Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a most peculiar disaster struck Íhtíhlùji̊ Ji̊ Qi̊v, causing great chunks of ice to fall from the sky.

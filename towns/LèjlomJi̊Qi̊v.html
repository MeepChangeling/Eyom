The establishment of Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community.

<p>Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings folow an organic layout of spacious cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v lost 147 people, 278 livestock, and 63 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 105, when members of Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy expert. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lèjlom Ji̊ Qi̊v's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Clayhill Castle (/clayhill/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/DorwaldDutchy.html">Dorwald Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/KobianKingdom.html">Kobian Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Clayhill Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Clayhill Castle was founded by <a href="../people/IdrisHarewoodpajjl0gyfr.html">Idris Harewood</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Clayhill Castle has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Clayhill Castle receives an average of 250 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Clayhill Castle covers an area of nearly 27 km<sup>2</sup> (10 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2374 m (7788 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Clayhill Castle was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1552, by Idris Harewood. The establishment of Clayhill Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Clayhill Castle's construction back out of the project. Idris Harewood pushed on reguardles, and Clayhill Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Clayhill Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Clayhill Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Clayhill Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Clayhill Castle weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Unfortuantly, these budget focused millitary grade defenses are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Clayhill Castle makes you wonder how anything ever gets done. The locals have clear, obvious rivalries with one another, as seen through clenched teeth and fake smiles. What’s more, there is a serious lack of any organization and planning in Clayhill Castle’s layout as well as the local’s behaviors. The city seems to be a den of chaos where tongues are forked and local customs do not exist.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Clayhill Castle is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Clayhill Castle is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

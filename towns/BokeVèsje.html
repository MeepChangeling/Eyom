<p>Boke Vèsje (/vɛs/ /ʤe/ [vampire] [healthy]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Eyj̼íhrriqRegion.html">Eyj̼íhrriq Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Vèsje is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Vèsje was founded by <a href="../people/Bhrazsotg6cf4sn7z.html">Bhrazso</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Vèsje has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Boke Vèsje receives an average of 224 cm/y (88 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Vèsje covers an area of nearly 59 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5138 m (16856 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Vèsje was founded durring the early 9th century, by Bhrazso. The establishment of Boke Vèsje  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Boke Vèsje's construction back out of the project. Bhrazso pushed on reguardles, and Boke Vèsje was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Boke Vèsje was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Vèsje is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Vèsje is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive paverstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Boke Vèsje's robustly designed timber walls are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Vèsje has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Boke Vèsje long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Boke Vèsje was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Vèsje lost 275 people, 356 livestock, and 46 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 82, when members of Boke Vèsje's militia enacted an operation to fortify a particular prison. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Boke Vèsje's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Boke Vèsje's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Boke Vèsje's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

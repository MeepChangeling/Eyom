<p>The name Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ was founded by Haeromben, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1336, by Haeromben. The establishment of Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Haeromben electing to pay people to resettle in Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ.</p>
<p>Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ is buildings are located arround a single crampt cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The byou city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Mi Hûkeyà Mudâ.</p>

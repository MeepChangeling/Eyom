<p>The name Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè was founded by <a href="../people/Khêtx5ds0q2hd.html">Khê</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè covers an area of nearly 138 km<sup>2</sup> (55 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2076 m (6811 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1134, by Khê. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Khê.</p>
<p>Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow flagstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these brittle defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè was attacked by savage lizardfolks living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè lost 281 people, 307 livestock, and 49 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 37, when members of Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy general. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Thihêg̈ê-shëlê Sêdè's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

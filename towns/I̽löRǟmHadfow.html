<p>The name I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Batruc9igjdqmmn4.html">Batruc</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 2°C (35°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -23°C (-9°F). I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow receives an average of 298 cm/y (117 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow covers an area of nearly 115 km<sup>2</sup> (46 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3750 m (12303 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow was founded durring the early 19th century in late summer of the year 1823, by Batruc. The establishment of I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow's construction back out of the project. Batruc pushed on reguardles, and I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 19th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow is buildings are built arround a single narrow packed earth mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Unfortuantly, these failry decent fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<p>I̽lö Rǟm Hadfow's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

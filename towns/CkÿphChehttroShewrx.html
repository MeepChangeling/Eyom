<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1299, by Gersel Nuldztrÿkle. The establishment of Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Gersel Nuldztrÿkle electing to pay people to resettle in Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive paverstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The city's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ckÿph Chehttro Shewrx long.</p>

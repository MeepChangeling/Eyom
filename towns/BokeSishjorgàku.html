<p>Boke Sishjorgàku (/siʃ/ /ʤorˈgəku/ [charcoal; fuel] [exotic]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/VātuchàjùRegion.html">Vātuchàjù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Sishjorgàku is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Sishjorgàku was founded by <a href="../people/Breshgghspvpk63.html">Bresh</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Sishjorgàku has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Boke Sishjorgàku receives an average of 247 cm/y (97 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Sishjorgàku covers an area of nearly 39 km<sup>2</sup> (15 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2030 m (6660 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Sishjorgàku was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1396, by Bresh. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Bresh.</p>
<p>Boke Sishjorgàku was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Sishjorgàku is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Boke Sishjorgàku is buildings are located arround a single crampt cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Boke Sishjorgàku's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Sishjorgàku has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Boke Sishjorgàku long.</p>

Communities that are not outright independent usually make an arm's-length submission to a local lord.</p>
<p>Boke Sishjorgàku's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

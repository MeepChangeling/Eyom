<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1070, by Brêpîga. The establishment of Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The city's exceptionaly well made fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ has a long tradition of martial expertise.

<p>Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ lost 142 people, 254 livestock, and 25 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 41, when members of Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a stalemate for Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Luhâ Ràge Kâchyâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

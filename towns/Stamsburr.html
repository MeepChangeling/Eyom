<p>Stamsburr (/stambay/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/DùvoshCounty.html">Dùvosh County</a>, <a href="../provences/QibanKingdom.html">Qiban Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Stamsburr is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Stamsburr was founded by <a href="../people/GhrinshiyQuilleypz73diyfwf.html">Ghrinshiy Quilley</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Stamsburr has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Stamsburr receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Stamsburr covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2540 m (8333 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Stamsburr was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1357, by Ghrinshiy Quilley. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ghrinshiy Quilley.</p>
<p>Stamsburr was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Stamsburr is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Stamsburr is buildings folow an organic layout of premissive flagstone streets whihch gives the town a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  town has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Stamsburr's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Astonishigly, the monster and outlaw focused fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Stamsburr, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the town. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Stamsburr possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Stamsburr has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Stamsburr has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Stamsburr. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Stamsburr's parks.</p>

<p>Stamsburr possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Stamsburr's grid is powered by a boiler and turbine based power plant.</p>
<p>Stamsburr has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Stamsburr's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Stamsburr has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Stamsburr has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Stamsburr's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Stamsburr there are no smells.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\BumblebeeGiant.html">Bumblebee, Giant</a> near Stamsburr are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Stamsburr's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Mysticism energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Stamsburr's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Stamsburr suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Stamsburr was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Stamsburr. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Stamsburr lost 185 people, 351 livestock, and 74 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 127, when members of Stamsburr's militia enacted an operation to recruit a specific  hero. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with the defense of the prison against a siege, which ended in defeat for Stamsburr's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Stamsburr's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj (/vɪ̞j̼/ /dəʤ/ [shark] [abundant; lush]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HarlishamCommunity.html">Harlisham Community</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj was founded by Ceratoppes Glyn Davies, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj receives an average of 289 cm/y (113 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj covers an area of nearly 284 km<sup>2</sup> (113 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1130 m (3707 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj was founded durring the late 16th century in winter of the year 1465, by Ceratoppes Glyn Davies. The establishment of Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj's construction back out of the project. Ceratoppes Glyn Davies pushed on reguardles, and Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj is was constructed arround several premissive packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The byou city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj's cost-cutting-focused defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\DeerRinghorn.html">Deer, Ringhorn</a> near Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves ritual combat to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 1 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj’s streets.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> protected Qi̘v Víhy̼dàj's harvest from an army of bandits. The recitation of the hero's story remains a popular tavern and fair tale.</p>

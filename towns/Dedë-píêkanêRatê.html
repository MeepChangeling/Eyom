<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Dedë-píêkanê Ratê is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Dedë-píêkanê Ratê was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Dedë-píêkanê Ratê lost 116 people, 364 livestock, and 87 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 208, when members of Dedë-píêkanê Ratê's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular vault from enemy attack. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with the defense of the vault against a siege, which ended in defeat for Dedë-píêkanê Ratê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Dedë-píêkanê Ratê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

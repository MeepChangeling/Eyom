<p>Boke Kversop (Kver /sop/ [barrel; drum] [patriot]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kririsi̊mùRegion.html">Kririsi̊mù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Kversop is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Kversop was founded by <a href="../people/Vúó̄̄ftvxczxrjf.html">Vúó̄̄</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Kversop has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Boke Kversop receives an average of 266 cm/y (104 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Kversop covers an area of nearly 199 km<sup>2</sup> (79 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2400 m (7874 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Kversop was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1314, by Vúó̄̄. The establishment of Boke Kversop was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Vúó̄̄ electing to pay people to resettle in Boke Kversop.</p>
<p>Boke Kversop was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Kversop is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Boke Kversop is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Boke Kversop's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Boke Kversop's budget oriented has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1421, by Shèqtho. The establishment of Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Shèqtho electing to pay people to resettle in Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya.</p>
<p>Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious paverstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya was attacked by a group of notorious bandits. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya lost 291 people, 286 livestock, and 41 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 60, when members of Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to destroy or capture a particular enemy warchest. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the port, which ended in defeat for Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qàdu̹be Gu̽mû Gûchya's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

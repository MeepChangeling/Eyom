<p>The name Leach Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Leach Castle was founded by <a href="../people/RrhithnorKennedyv554fymxx1.html">Rrhithnor Kennedy</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Leach Castle was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1449, by Rrhithnor Kennedy. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Leach Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Leach Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Leach Castle is buildings folow an organic layout of premissive gravel streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Leach Castle's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Leach Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Leach Castle used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Leach Castle.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Leach Castle was struck by unseasonably warm weather, causing a sweltering heat to smouther the land for 22 days. Leach Castle lost 258 people and  317 livestock in the disaster.. The deadly heat is remembered by most as the Woe's Flame.</p>

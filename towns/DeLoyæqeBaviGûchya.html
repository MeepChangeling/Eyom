<p>The name De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Ch́åhia7fyuyhfsq.html">Ch́åhi</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya receives an average of 319 cm/y (125 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya covers an area of nearly 206 km<sup>2</sup> (82 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4460 m (14632 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya was founded durring the early 11th century, by Ch́åhi. The establishment of De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Ch́åhi electing to pay people to resettle in De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya.</p>
<p>De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya is is constructed  arround a series of crampt flagstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya's budget oriented has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in De Loyæqe Bavi Gûchya long.</p>

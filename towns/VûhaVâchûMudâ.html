<p>The name Vûha Vâchû Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Vûha Vâchû Mudâ was founded by Saelheneb, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vûha Vâchû Mudâ was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1284, by Saelheneb. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Vûha Vâchû Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vûha Vâchû Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Vûha Vâchû Mudâ is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive paverstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Vûha Vâchû Mudâ, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Vûha Vâchû Mudâ has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Vûha Vâchû Mudâ suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Vûha Vâchû Mudâ long.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Vûha Vâchû Mudâ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Vûha Vâchû Mudâ lost 276 people, 126 livestock, and 91 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 67, when members of Vûha Vâchû Mudâ's militia enacted an operation to recruit a particular special forces group. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Vûha Vâchû Mudâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Vûha Vâchû Mudâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

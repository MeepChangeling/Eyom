<p>Knightsstedt (/naɪts/ /stedt/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SherstedbuEarldom.html">Sherstedbu Earldom</a> of the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHobben.html">Kingdom of Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Knightsstedt is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Knightsstedt was founded by Gwendolyn Krout, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Knightsstedt has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Knightsstedt receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Knightsstedt covers an area of nearly 271 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 796 m (2611 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Knightsstedt was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1452, by Gwendolyn Krout. The establishment of Knightsstedt suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Knightsstedt was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Knightsstedt is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Knightsstedt is buildings folow an organic layout of restrictive cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The valley city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Knightsstedt's Ragnarock-era relics are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Knightsstedt shows Knightsstedt is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Knightsstedt's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Knightsstedt sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Gremlin.html">Gremlin</a> near Knightsstedt are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Knightsstedt's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves drinking to channel Transmutation energies of tier 1 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

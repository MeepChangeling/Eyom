<p>The name Westbourne Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Westbourne Castle was founded by <a href="../people/IhzehWathey5dnipik8p9.html">Ihzeh Wathey</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Westbourne Castle has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F).

Westbourne Castle covers an area of nearly 40 km<sup>2</sup> (16 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2248 m (7375 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Westbourne Castle was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1309, by Ihzeh Wathey. The establishment of Westbourne Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ihzeh Wathey struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Westbourne Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Westbourne Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Westbourne Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Westbourne Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow paverstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a city of Westbourne Castle's size could have. The city's well-designed, yet cheep are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Westbourne Castle seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Westbourne Castle is reliant on an industry or product that has toxic or negative side-effects as part of its production. The good is extremely valuable, or the community is extremely desperate, and the side effects are endured as a necessary evil. It may be that their neighbors or lord are forcing them to produce the good so that they aren’t the ones suffering the cost.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Westbourne Castle possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>

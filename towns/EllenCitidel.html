<p>The name Ellen Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ellen Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/PasseturaBeckwithcb4dspnfyw.html">Passetura Beckwith</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ellen Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Ellen Citidel receives an average of 123 cm/y (48 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Ellen Citidel covers an area of nearly 59 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8852 m (-13907 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ellen Citidel was founded durring the early 17th century in early spring of the year 1603, by Passetura Beckwith. The establishment of Ellen Citidel suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ellen Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ellen Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ellen Citidel is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive paverstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Ellen Citidel's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Ellen Citidel seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Ellen Citidel the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ellen Citidel's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is skipped in Ellen Citidel.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

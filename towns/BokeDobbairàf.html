<p>Boke Dobbairàf (/ˈdobba/ /ˈirəf/ [liberty] [sticky]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Sti̊ci̊qRegion.html">Sti̊ci̊q Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Dobbairàf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Dobbairàf was founded by <a href="../people/Fyesêgtl7g371ib.html">Fyesê</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Dobbairàf has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Boke Dobbairàf receives an average of 288 cm/y (113 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Dobbairàf covers an area of nearly 164 km<sup>2</sup> (65 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1620 m (5314 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Dobbairàf was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1204, by Fyesê. The establishment of Boke Dobbairàf suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Boke Dobbairàf was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Dobbairàf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Boke Dobbairàf is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive canals streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The millitarily questionable fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Boke Dobbairàf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Boke Dobbairàf hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with. This hate may spring from recent events, or it may be an inherited spite from old wrongs.</p>
<p>Boke Dobbairàf's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

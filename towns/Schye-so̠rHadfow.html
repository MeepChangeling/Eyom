<p>Schye-so̠r Hadfow (/sce/ /so̠r/ [palace] [bra]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/ḾoůmaH́ueo̊Moot.html">Ḿoůma H́ueo̊ Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Schye-so̠r Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Schye-so̠r Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Kherzelgldilmrqzg.html">Kherzel</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Schye-so̠r Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Schye-so̠r Hadfow receives an average of 190 cm/y (74 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Schye-so̠r Hadfow covers an area of nearly 49 km<sup>2</sup> (19 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2724 m (8937 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Schye-so̠r Hadfow was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1290, by Kherzel. The establishment of Schye-so̠r Hadfow  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Schye-so̠r Hadfow's construction back out of the project. Kherzel pushed on reguardles, and Schye-so̠r Hadfow was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Schye-so̠r Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Schye-so̠r Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Schye-so̠r Hadfow is is constructed arround a semi-circular broad packed earth mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Schye-so̠r Hadfow weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Schye-so̠r Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Schye-so̠r Hadfow ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Schye-so̠r Hadfow is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Schye-so̠r Hadfow long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Schye-so̠r Hadfow has a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.</p>
<p>Schye-so̠r Hadfow's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is skipped in Schye-so̠r Hadfow.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

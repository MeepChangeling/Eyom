<p>The name Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Treshèbrêtmbkjix9dv.html">Treshèbrê</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow receives an average of 270 cm/y (106 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow covers an area of nearly 43 km<sup>2</sup> (17 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4432 m (14540 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1342, by Treshèbrê. The establishment of Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Treshèbrê struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow is is constructed  arround a series of narrow cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow long.</p>

<p>Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations.

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow lost 258 people, 132 livestock, and 41 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 205, when members of Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to liberate a particular vault from the enemy. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with the defense of the vault against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Gri̽ Qüeöt Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

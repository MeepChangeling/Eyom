<p>Qi̘v Qerdèbi (/qer/ /ˈdɛbi/ [terror] [fuzzy]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CleoviliaCommunity.html">Cleovilia Community</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Qerdèbi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Qerdèbi was founded by Sheg̈m Llywelyn, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Qerdèbi has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Qi̘v Qerdèbi receives an average of 236 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qi̘v Qerdèbi covers an area of nearly 312 km<sup>2</sup> (124 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4182 m (13720 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Qerdèbi was founded durring the late 11th century, by Sheg̈m Llywelyn. The establishment of Qi̘v Qerdèbi was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Sheg̈m Llywelyn electing to pay people to resettle in Qi̘v Qerdèbi.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Qerdèbi was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Qerdèbi is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Qerdèbi is buildings are located arround a single narrow flagstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The hillside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Qi̘v Qerdèbi, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look arround Qi̘v Qerdèbi reveals an abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Qerdèbi has a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Qerdèbi's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>
<p>=In Qi̘v Qerdèbi when drawing, it's impossible to draw an imperfect circle.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

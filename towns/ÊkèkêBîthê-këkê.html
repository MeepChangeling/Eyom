<p>Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê (/ˈbɪʃɘ/ /ˈkëkɘ/ [flat] [bully]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/QangîkmêdêCounty.html">Qangîkmêdê County</a>, <a href="../provences/VangîfkthêkèProvence.html">Vangîfkthêkè Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê was founded by <a href="../people/Drew39y0bavtdn.html">Drew</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê receives an average of 207 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê covers an area of nearly 83 km<sup>2</sup> (33 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4654 m (15269 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê was founded durring the late 10th century, by Drew. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Drew.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive flagstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>A substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign settlement conquered within the relatively recent past. The locals may not be enthusiastic about being ruled by others not of their kind, and their neighbors may look askance at the way foreign customs or even laws may be maintained.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>In Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿SnakeViper.html">﻿Snake, Viper</a> near Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Illusion energies of tier 3 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê was attacked by a group of nobles with their private armies. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê lost 228 people, 391 livestock, and 95 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 62, when members of Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê's militia enacted an operation to construct defenses in a particular depot. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Êkèkê Bîthê-këkê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

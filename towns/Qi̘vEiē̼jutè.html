<p>Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè (/ej̼/ /ˈʤutɛ/ [mood; attitude] [naive; innocent]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Stirfíhhi̊pCounty.html">Stirfíhhi̊p County</a>, <a href="../provences/PersCouncil.html">Pers Council</a>, within the <a href="../nations/TauranianUnitedProvinces.html">Tauranian United Provinces</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè was founded by Ca̋mé̄y Cúoīs 'Ivory Gunslinger' Ermp̪f̄ Yāstoīs Yāy Gakēè, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè receives an average of 210 cm/y (82 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè covers an area of nearly 515 km<sup>2</sup> (206 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1040 m (3412 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1294, by Ca̋mé̄y Cúoīs 'Ivory Gunslinger' Ermp̪f̄ Yāstoīs Yāy Gakēè. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ca̋mé̄y Cúoīs 'Ivory Gunslinger' Ermp̪f̄ Yāstoīs Yāy Gakēè.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè is buildings are arranged arround a single crampt cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The riverside city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè's budget oriented are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè makes you wonder how anything ever gets done. The locals have clear, obvious rivalries with one another, as seen through clenched teeth and fake smiles. What’s more, there is a serious lack of any organization and planning in Qi̘v Eiē̼jutè’s layout as well as the local’s behaviors. The city seems to be a den of chaos where tongues are forked and local customs do not exist.</p>

<p>Gowan Citidel (/ˈgaʊən/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gowan Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Gowan Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/TsheshNanceadxsykisza.html">Tshesh Nance</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gowan Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Gowan Citidel receives an average of 259 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Gowan Citidel covers an area of nearly 159 km<sup>2</sup> (63 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1192 m (3910 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gowan Citidel was founded durring the early 11th century, by Tshesh Nance. The establishment of Gowan Citidel suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Gowan Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gowan Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gowan Citidel is buildings are arranged within a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Gowan Citidel's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Gowan Citidel's budget oriented are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Gowan Citidel has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Gowan Citidel suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Gowan Citidel long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Gowan Citidel was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Gowan Citidel lost 277 people, 198 livestock, and 41 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 92, when members of Gowan Citidel's militia enacted an operation to gain control of a particular vault. The operation was complicated by the army's activities draw the wrath of formerly neutral parties. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the research site, which ended in defeat for Gowan Citidel's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Gowan Citidel's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

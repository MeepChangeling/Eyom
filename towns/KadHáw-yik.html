<p>Kad Háw-yik (/hə˞w/ /jic/ [mature] [wave (ocean); surge]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FtuzmïlärtäRegion.html">Ftuzmïlärtä Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Háw-yik is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Háw-yik was founded by <a href="../people/Dheingup36w6fxkwq.html">Dheingu</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Háw-yik has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -14°C (7°F). Kad Háw-yik receives an average of 241 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kad Háw-yik covers an area of nearly 197 km<sup>2</sup> (78 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6082 m (19954 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Háw-yik was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1260, by Dheingu. The establishment of Kad Háw-yik suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Kad Háw-yik which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Kad Háw-yik was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Háw-yik is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Kad Háw-yik is is constructed  arround a series of narrow cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Kad Háw-yik's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Háw-yik makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Háw-yik's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Kad Háw-yik rainbows form quite often above the Large City.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\BonewroughtWillow.html">Bonewrought Willow</a> near Kad Háw-yik are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Kad Háw-yik's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves consuming a local narcotic to channel Transmutation energies of tier 2 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Kad Háw-yik's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Kad Háw-yik is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> killed a tyrannical  who had controlled Kad Háw-yik for years.  was immortalized in song for this deed.</p>

<p>Tiöv-fyed Med (/tjo˞v/ /fjed/ [sling] [atom]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ComacharithCounty.html">Comacharith County</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tiöv-fyed Med is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Tiöv-fyed Med was founded by <a href="../people/ElizabethCrosrebu33xxi2xik0.html">Elizabeth Crosrebu</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tiöv-fyed Med has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Tiöv-fyed Med receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Tiöv-fyed Med covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3458 m (11345 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tiöv-fyed Med was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1117, by Elizabeth Crosrebu. The establishment of Tiöv-fyed Med suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Tiöv-fyed Med was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tiöv-fyed Med is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tiöv-fyed Med is buildings have been located at convienant points along the valley Tiöv-fyed Med was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious canals streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The exceptionaly well made fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Tiöv-fyed Med seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Tiöv-fyed Med's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves.

The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Tiöv-fyed Med's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Tiöv-fyed Med was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Tiöv-fyed Med. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Tiöv-fyed Med lost 156 people, 326 livestock, and 45 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 153, when members of Tiöv-fyed Med's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular  hero, and ensure they remain out of enemy hands. The operation was complicated by at least some of the intelligence related to the operation was incorrect. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the vault, which ended in a crushing defeat for Tiöv-fyed Med's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Tiöv-fyed Med's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Marron Citidel (/ˈmɛrən/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BluerockDutchy.html">Bluerock Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/QibanKingdom.html">Qiban Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Marron Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Marron Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/NonEverycr3ub5lk98.html">Non Every</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Marron Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Marron Citidel receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Marron Citidel covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4834 m (15859 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Marron Citidel was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1432, by Non Every. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Non Every.</p>
<p>Marron Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Marron Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Marron Citidel is buildings are speckled and packed arround restrictive packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Marron Citidel's robustly designed timber walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Marron Citidel seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Marron Citidel is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Marron Citidel's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Marron Citidel suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<p>The name Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Mocthëipi97nqrw20.html">Mocthëi</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1333, by Mocthëi. The establishment of Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya's construction back out of the project. Mocthëi pushed on reguardles, and Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad flagstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya brings to mind.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 3 years has greatly spiked Ku̽sahi Rûlu̽ Gûchya's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>

<p>Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ˈəkʃəˑʤ/ /i̘q/ [trivia] [awake; aware; conscious]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/KíhshwíhhèdíhgCounty.html">Kíhshwíhhèdíhg County</a>, <a href="../provences/TafoginProvence.html">Tafogin Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Gîbeligfrgx8ztgk.html">Gîbeli</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 161 cm/y (63 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 181 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3276 m (10748 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1110, by Gîbeli. The establishment of Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v is was constructed arround several restrictive cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Astonishigly, the unusual though effective defenses are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v is like a look into a broken heart which long ago fell to corruption. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need… unless of course, they would be an easy target for some robbery. The city has truly fallen to evil.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>

<p>Àkshāji̊q Ji̊ Qi̊v's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves creating small tokens to channel Mysticism energies of tier 3 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Píeyêhe-tani Ratê (/p˔eˈjɘhe/ /ˈtani/ [diameter] [sand; shore; dirt]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/RehîêroZone.html">Rehîêro Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Píeyêhe-tani Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Píeyêhe-tani Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Gúdienqi8s56pxnk.html">Gúdien</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Píeyêhe-tani Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Píeyêhe-tani Ratê receives an average of 239 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Píeyêhe-tani Ratê covers an area of nearly 103 km<sup>2</sup> (41 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3676 m (12060 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Píeyêhe-tani Ratê was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1305, by Gúdien. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Gúdien.</p>
<p>Píeyêhe-tani Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Píeyêhe-tani Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Píeyêhe-tani Ratê is buildings are speckled and packed arround broad cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The city's exceptionaly well made fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Píeyêhe-tani Ratê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Píeyêhe-tani Ratê's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is long in Píeyêhe-tani Ratê.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

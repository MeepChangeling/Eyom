<p>Jîngim-vêlè Ratê (/ˈtɘkë/ /ˈvɘlè/ [sour; bitter] [pedestrian]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BèmîgêthakiZone.html">Bèmîgêthaki Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jîngim-vêlè Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Jîngim-vêlè Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Laiciel07k4ufsb10.html">Laiciel</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jîngim-vêlè Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Jîngim-vêlè Ratê receives an average of 210 cm/y (82 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Jîngim-vêlè Ratê covers an area of nearly 89 km<sup>2</sup> (35 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3930 m (12893 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jîngim-vêlè Ratê was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1349, by Laiciel. The establishment of Jîngim-vêlè Ratê was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Laiciel struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Jîngim-vêlè Ratê as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Jîngim-vêlè Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jîngim-vêlè Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Jîngim-vêlè Ratê is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Jîngim-vêlè Ratê's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Jîngim-vêlè Ratê's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Jîngim-vêlè Ratê has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Jîngim-vêlè Ratê’s streets. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as relaxing. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p>Jîngim-vêlè Ratê's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

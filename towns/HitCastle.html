<p>Hit Castle (/hɪt/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/DellmontDutchy.html">Dellmont Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/FusanKingdom.html">Fusan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hit Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hit Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ÈqthêKovachikjyc6a60jum.html">Èqthê Kovachik</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hit Castle has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Hit Castle receives an average of 141 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Hit Castle covers an area of nearly 13 km<sup>2</sup> (5 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3510 m (11515 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hit Castle was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1092, by Èqthê Kovachik. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Èqthê Kovachik.</p>
<p>Hit Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hit Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hit Castle is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Hit Castle's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Hit Castle's budget oriented are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Hit Castle gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. A second look around Hit Castle makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Life is hard in Hit Castle. Its people are impoverished compared to their peers elsewhere. Something is making the locals stay, however, whether fear of the alternative, hope for a better future, or a stubborn attachment to their ancestral lands. Whatver the reason, living in this harsh area for generations has made the people of Hit Castle a notably resourceful and hearty people.</p>
<p>Hit Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Hit Castle sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\VaporWasp.html">Vapor Wasp</a> near Hit Castle are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Hit Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 1 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Hit Castle was attacked by a slaver gang capable of fielding large forces. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Hit Castle lost 151 people, 241 livestock, and 56 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 74, when members of Hit Castle's militia enacted an operation to extract assets from a research site under siege by the enemy. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a stalemate for Hit Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Hit Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

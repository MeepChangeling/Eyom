<p>Blueridge (/bluː/ /rɪʤ/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/DragonseaDutchy.html">Dragonsea Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/BaldockiaMargrave.html">Baldockia Margrave</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Blueridge is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Blueridge was founded by Garîv Rooney, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Blueridge has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Blueridge receives an average of 172 cm/y (67 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Blueridge covers an area of nearly 527 km<sup>2</sup> (210 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4204 m (13792 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Blueridge was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1366, by Garîv Rooney. The establishment of Blueridge suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Blueridge was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Blueridge is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Blueridge is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive gravel streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The lakeside city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Blueridge weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Blueridge has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Blueridge, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Blueridge possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Blueridge has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Blueridge's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Blueridge has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<p>Blueridge is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Blueridge's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is recurring in Blueridge.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Serpentfolk.html">Serpentfolk</a> near Blueridge are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Blueridge's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves square dance to channel Abjuration energies of tier 2 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Blueridge is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>
<p>Blueridge makes use of canals for some of its streets. Locals often fish in the canals.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century several years of heavy rains culminated in a peculiar disaster. A great hole opened up beneath Blueridge, swallowing large sections of the community. Blueridge lost 140 people, 204 livestock, and 79 buildings in the disaster. This disaster is often refereed to as The Cursed Fates Swallowing.</p>

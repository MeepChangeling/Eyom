<p>Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog (/trurt/ /tog/ [capacity] [revolution]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/DigitznäPrincipality.html">Digitznä Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Nika.html">Nika</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog was founded by <a href="../people/Êpîtrq0aah5az.html">Êpî</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 1°C (33°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog receives an average of 209 cm/y (82 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog covers an area of nearly 245 km<sup>2</sup> (98 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1752 m (5748 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog was founded durring the late 10th century, by Êpî. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Êpî electing to pay people to resettle in Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The exceptionaly well made fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog shows Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 2 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog lost 245 people, 265 livestock, and 31 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 155, when members of Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog's militia enacted an operation to escort a specific  general to a safe location. The operation was complicated by the enemy forces had far more numbers than estimated. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Slæ̈rn Trurt-tog's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

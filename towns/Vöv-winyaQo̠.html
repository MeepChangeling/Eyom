<p>Vöv-winya Qo̠ (/vo˞v/ /ˈwinja/ [honor; integrity; dignity] [locker]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/RidanEarldom.html">Ridan Earldom</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vöv-winya Qo̠ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Vöv-winya Qo̠ was founded by Danielle Dhiaginra, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vöv-winya Qo̠ has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -10°C (14°F). Vöv-winya Qo̠ receives an average of 155 cm/y (61 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Vöv-winya Qo̠ covers an area of nearly 321 km<sup>2</sup> (128 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4142 m (13589 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vöv-winya Qo̠ was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1210, by Danielle Dhiaginra. The establishment of Vöv-winya Qo̠ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Danielle Dhiaginra struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Vöv-winya Qo̠ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Vöv-winya Qo̠ was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vöv-winya Qo̠ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Vöv-winya Qo̠ is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive baked earthen mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The valley city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The city's millitarily questionable fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Vöv-winya Qo̠ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Vöv-winya Qo̠ possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program.

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Vöv-winya Qo̠ is reliant on an industry or product that has toxic or negative side-effects as part of its production. The good is extremely valuable, or the community is extremely desperate, and the side effects are endured as a necessary evil. It may be that their neighbors or lord are forcing them to produce the good so that they aren’t the ones suffering the cost.</p>
<p>Vöv-winya Qo̠'s roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Vöv-winya Qo̠ suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

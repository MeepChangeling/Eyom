<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä (/gaʊ̯́/ /ŋkʰʌ̂ʃæ/ [beautiful; attractive; pretty] [arch; arc; dome]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Īchnḱyǐyátzmb̪vRegion.html">Īchnḱyǐyátzmb̪v Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/NitsaNåh́aDiyḿuu8bhf4321.html">Nitsa Nåh́a Diyḿ</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 296 cm/y (116 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 202 km<sup>2</sup> (80 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2438 m (7998 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1177, by Nitsa Nåh́a Diyḿ. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Nitsa Nåh́a Diyḿ.</p>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive packed earth streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä is like a look into a broken heart. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need. It’s not malicious. Heads are hung. Eyes are empty. Something truly horrible happened here once upon a time and the city never healed.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä has an Scientific Academy which provides higher education in the natural sciences.</p>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large City. Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä's grid is powered by a direct leyline tap.</p>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>

<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\MarbleSnake.html">Marble Snake</a> near Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Goú Nḱûshä Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves square dance to channel Augury energies of tier 1 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

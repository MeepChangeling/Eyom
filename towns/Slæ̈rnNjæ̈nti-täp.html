<p>The name Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp was founded by <a href="../people/Shîdyrrqzu4xtr.html">Shîd</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp has a yearly average temperature of 11°C (51°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 10°C (50°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp receives an average of 283 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp covers an area of nearly 180 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2074 m (6804 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1138, by Shîd. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp is buildings are arranged within a network of restrictive paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp’s streets. A look around Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is recurring in Slæ̈rn Njæ̈nti-täp.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Rachye Kàra Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Rachye Kàra Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Lewys7ggpa5bxf9.html">Lewys</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rachye Kàra Gûchya was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1175, by Lewys. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Lewys.</p>
<p>Rachye Kàra Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rachye Kàra Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Rachye Kàra Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt packed earth streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The city's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>

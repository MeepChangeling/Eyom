<p>The name Zmö Fratno Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Zmö Fratno Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Alagwenxzl5h5r1mb.html">Alagwen</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zmö Fratno Gri has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zmö Fratno Gri was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1282, by Alagwen. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Zmö Fratno Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zmö Fratno Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Zmö Fratno Gri is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive gravel streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Astonishigly, the cost-cutting-focused defences are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Zmö Fratno Gri hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<p>The name Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/Ch́åtskz3t4balvq.html">Ch́åts</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1194, by Ch́åts. The establishment of Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are located arround a single narrow packed earth mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The budget focused millitary grade defenses have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh’s streets.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami spared the town from the rampage of a legendary monster. One of Lÿ Phath Ÿhkphÿh's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

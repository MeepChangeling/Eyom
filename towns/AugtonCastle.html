<p>The name Augton Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Augton Castle was founded by <a href="../people/MaegangSalesbui3ndr5pr.html">Maegang Sales</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Augton Castle was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1402, by Maegang Sales. The establishment of Augton Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Augton Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Augton Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Augton Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Augton Castle is is constructed  arround a series of narrow cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Augton Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Augton Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is long in Augton Castle.</p>

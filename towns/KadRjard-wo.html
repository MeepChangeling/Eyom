<p>Kad Rjard-wo (/rjard/ /wo/ [backward] [science]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SlïrddámsPrincipality.html">Slïrddáms Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Cochi.html">Cochi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Rjard-wo is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Rjard-wo was founded by <a href="../people/Brêbè04pld49b4t.html">Brêbè</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Rjard-wo has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 2°C (35°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Kad Rjard-wo receives an average of 205 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Kad Rjard-wo covers an area of nearly 81 km<sup>2</sup> (32 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1708 m (5603 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Rjard-wo was founded durring the late 11th century, by Brêbè. The establishment of Kad Rjard-wo was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Brêbè electing to pay people to resettle in Kad Rjard-wo.</p>
<p>Kad Rjard-wo was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Rjard-wo is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Kad Rjard-wo is buildings have been located at convienant points along the pond Kad Rjard-wo was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Astonishigly, the failry decent fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Rjard-wo has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kad Rjard-wo long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Rjard-wo's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Kad Rjard-wo all of the cats speak in a dead language.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Kad Rjard-wo has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>

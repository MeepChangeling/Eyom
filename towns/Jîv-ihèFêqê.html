<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê (/ˈdɘli/ /ˈihè/ [sick; ill; unwell] [bed]) is a temperate Small Town located in the <a href="../provences/JĭǐkhěnDistrict.html">Jĭǐkhěn District</a> of the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jîv-ihè Fêqê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Jîv-ihè Fêqê was founded by <a href="../people/MlêbêTrêg̈mepí8p9s6im8n9.html">Mlêbê Trêg̈mepí</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Jîv-ihè Fêqê receives an average of 187 cm/y (73 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Jîv-ihè Fêqê covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3954 m (12972 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1055, by Mlêbê Trêg̈mepí. The establishment of Jîv-ihè Fêqê  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Jîv-ihè Fêqê's construction back out of the project. Mlêbê Trêg̈mepí pushed on reguardles, and Jîv-ihè Fêqê was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jîv-ihè Fêqê is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt flagstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Jîv-ihè Fêqê's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Jîv-ihè Fêqê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Jîv-ihè Fêqê.</p>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Jîv-ihè Fêqê's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.</p>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>In Jîv-ihè Fêqê during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Ankheg.html">Ankheg</a> near Jîv-ihè Fêqê are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves performance art to channel Necromancy energies of tier 2 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Jîv-ihè Fêqê has access to some sort of functioning ancient infrastructure, whether it's an array of wall-mounted arcane energy projectors, running water, moving roadways, community-wide climate control, or some other inherited luxury. This infrastructure may be the result of a still-functional Working, or it could be the product of some venerable occult engine that's still operational, or it may be the fruit of the labors of some specially-designed organism or Blighted populace.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Jîv-ihè Fêqê is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Jîv-ihè Fêqê was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Jîv-ihè Fêqê lost 222 people, 346 livestock, and 78 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 98, when members of Jîv-ihè Fêqê's militia enacted an operation to liberate a particular strategic location from the enemy. The operation was complicated by the enemy forces had far more numbers than estimated. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Jîv-ihè Fêqê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Jîv-ihè Fêqê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

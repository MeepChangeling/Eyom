<p>Bruv Mo̠l Kez (/bruv/ /mo̠l/ [single] [pastry]) is a subtropical Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/Fle̜költyoMoot.html">Fle̜költyo Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bruv Mo̠l Kez is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Bruv Mo̠l Kez was founded by <a href="../people/RanmusPhiegror2yr22xr4kk.html">Ranmus Phiegror</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bruv Mo̠l Kez has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 1°C (33°F). Bruv Mo̠l Kez receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Bruv Mo̠l Kez covers an area of nearly 7 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3692 m (12112 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bruv Mo̠l Kez was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1314, by Ranmus Phiegror. The establishment of Bruv Mo̠l Kez  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Bruv Mo̠l Kez's construction back out of the project. Ranmus Phiegror pushed on reguardles, and Bruv Mo̠l Kez was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Bruv Mo̠l Kez was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bruv Mo̠l Kez is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bruv Mo̠l Kez is buildings are arranged within a network of narrow split-log ties streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Bruv Mo̠l Kez weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The town's budget focused millitary grade defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Bruv Mo̠l Kez, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the town. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Bruv Mo̠l Kez's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is short in Bruv Mo̠l Kez.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Bruv Mo̠l Kez's residents established a new industry (11097 % 6)+1 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> secured a clean water supply for . A small order of knights was founded in 's honor, and bears his name to this day.</p>

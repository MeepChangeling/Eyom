<p>Beult Castle (/beult/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/NewfieldDutchy.html">Newfield Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/KobianKingdom.html">Kobian Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Beult Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Beult Castle was founded by <a href="../people/DylanShepherd-Barronilwz47azhh.html">Dylan Shepherd-Barron</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Beult Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F). Beult Castle receives an average of 259 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Beult Castle covers an area of nearly 47 km<sup>2</sup> (18 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 976 m (3202 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Beult Castle was founded durring the late 17th century in late fall of the year 1582, by Dylan Shepherd-Barron. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Dylan Shepherd-Barron.</p>
<p>Beult Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Beult Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Beult Castle is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The robustly designed timber walls has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Beult Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<p>A substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign settlement conquered within the relatively recent past. The locals may not be enthusiastic about being ruled by others not of their kind, and their neighbors may look askance at the way foreign customs or even laws may be maintained.</p>
<p>Beult Castle's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

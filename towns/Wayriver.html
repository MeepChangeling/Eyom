<p>Wayriver (/weɪ/ /ˈrɪvə/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ShadowfallDutchy.html">Shadowfall Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/LedoniaEarldom.html">Ledonia Earldom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wayriver is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wayriver was founded by Synfelis Senior, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wayriver has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Wayriver receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Wayriver covers an area of nearly 262 km<sup>2</sup> (104 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3892 m (12769 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wayriver was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1141, by Synfelis Senior. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Synfelis Senior.</p>
<p>Wayriver was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wayriver is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wayriver is buildings have been located at convienant points along the mountain Wayriver was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The mountain city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Wayriver weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Unfortuantly, these budget focused millitary grade defenses are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Wayriver has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Wayriver ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Wayriver as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Wayriver has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wayriver's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Wayriver there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Xtabay.html">Xtabay</a> near Wayriver are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Wayriver's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves gestures to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 2 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Wayriver is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Wayriver's residents established a new industry (26435 % 6)+1 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Wayriver was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Wayriver lost 218 people, 308 livestock, and 55 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 104, when members of Wayriver's militia enacted an operation to destroy or capture a particular enemy powerful weapon. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the fortification, which ended in victory for Wayriver's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Wayriver's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Greet Castle (/grit/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Greet Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Greet Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ShegarêvRoodstpa61abc3.html">Shegarêv Rood</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Greet Castle has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 18°C (64°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Greet Castle receives an average of 246 cm/y (96 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Greet Castle covers an area of nearly 160 km<sup>2</sup> (64 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1286 m (4219 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Greet Castle was founded durring the late 11th century, by Shegarêv Rood. The establishment of Greet Castle was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Shegarêv Rood electing to pay people to resettle in Greet Castle.</p>
<p>Greet Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Greet Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Greet Castle is is constructed  arround a series of spacious flagstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Greet Castle has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Greet Castle ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Greet Castle is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Greet Castle was like during the glorydays.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>

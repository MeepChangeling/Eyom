<p>Yevî-tho Bî (/ˈjevɪ/ /θo/ [urban] [face; front; expression]) is a temperate Town located in the <a href="../provences/Têqayëg̈êZone.html">Têqayëg̈ê Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Yevî-tho Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Yevî-tho Bî was founded by <a href="../people/G̈îlêFyèlêmëj0bd0yh32b.html">G̈îlê Fyèlêmë</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Yevî-tho Bî receives an average of 225 cm/y (88 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Yevî-tho Bî covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4396 m (14422 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1123, by G̈îlê Fyèlêmë. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yevî-tho Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî is buildings folow an organic layout of premissive gravel streets whihch gives the town a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  town posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Yevî-tho Bî weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The town's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Yevî-tho Bî hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the town nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the town, particularly the market.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Yevî-tho Bî. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Yevî-tho Bî's parks.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Yevî-tho Bî.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî has a government-funded child care program, overseen by the local Department of Nursemaids, which is responsible for providing childcare to working-class citizens according to local ordinances.</p>

<p>Yevî-tho Bî has an Administrative Academy which trains individuals in the administrative arts.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Yevî-tho Bî's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Yevî-tho Bî.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Almiraj.html">Almiraj</a> near Yevî-tho Bî are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Yevî-tho Bî's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves gestures to channel Augury energies of tier 2 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

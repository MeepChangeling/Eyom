<p>Qëgayê-ijë Ye (/qëˈgajɘ/ /ˈiʤë/ [guilty] [reef]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SzoreCounty.html">Szore County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qëgayê-ijë Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qëgayê-ijë Ye was founded by Mesopedia, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qëgayê-ijë Ye has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Qëgayê-ijë Ye receives an average of 197 cm/y (77 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Qëgayê-ijë Ye covers an area of nearly 332 km<sup>2</sup> (132 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4188 m (13740 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qëgayê-ijë Ye was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1355, by Mesopedia. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Mesopedia.</p>
<p>Qëgayê-ijë Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qëgayê-ijë Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qëgayê-ijë Ye is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Qëgayê-ijë Ye was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The riverside city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Qëgayê-ijë Ye's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The top tier civilian fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Qëgayê-ijë Ye has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Qëgayê-ijë Ye’s streets. A look around Qëgayê-ijë Ye has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Qëgayê-ijë Ye long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qëgayê-ijë Ye's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is short in Qëgayê-ijë Ye.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qëgayê-ijë Ye is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Qëgayê-ijë Ye used to be much richer, but something happened in the last (5379 % 6)+1 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> killed a tyrannical  who had controlled Qëgayê-ijë Ye for years. One of Qëgayê-ijë Ye's festivals remembers the hero.</p>

<p>Wiverlee  (/wiverlee / [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large Town located in <a href="../subprovences/TshtevizàwCounty.html">Tshtevizàw County</a>, <a href="../provences/PoxeiquianCounty.html">Poxeiquian County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/NorwickPrincipality.html">Norwick Principality</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wiverlee  is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wiverlee  was founded by <a href="../people/ÊyëkdsmWordsworthyjc9b4ut40.html">Êyëkdsm Wordsworth</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wiverlee  has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 15°C (59°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Wiverlee  receives an average of 266 cm/y (104 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Wiverlee  covers an area of nearly 7 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1420 m (4658 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wiverlee  was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1514, by Êyëkdsm Wordsworth. The establishment of Wiverlee  was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Êyëkdsm Wordsworth struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Wiverlee  as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Wiverlee  was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wiverlee  is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Wiverlee  is buildings have been located at convienant points along the swamp Wiverlee  was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the town is well defended against anything short of an army. The town's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Wiverlee  has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Wiverlee  ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Wiverlee  is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the town. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Wiverlee  long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Wiverlee  was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Wiverlee  lost 133 people, 253 livestock, and 24 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 96, when members of Wiverlee 's militia enacted an operation to secure a particular depot to utilize it for a specific task. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Winswich 's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Wiverlee 's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Wiverlee 's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

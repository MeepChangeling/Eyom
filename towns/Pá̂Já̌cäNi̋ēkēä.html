<p>Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä (/pɛ̂/ /ʤɛ̌kæ/ [ambiguous] [shovel]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ká̌váäRegion.html">Ká̌váä Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/GettiThedduVrislj7k6xrkqy.html">Getti Theddu Vris</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 295 cm/y (116 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 97 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2552 m (8372 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1356, by Getti Theddu Vris. The establishment of Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Getti Theddu Vris struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are speckled and packed arround premissive baked earthen streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä's millitarily questionable fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä the water is caffeinated.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Gremlin.html">Gremlin</a> near Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Pá̂ Já̌cä Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves reenactments to channel Abjuration energies of tier 3 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

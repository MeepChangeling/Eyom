<p>The name Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Ýi̊kcywa9i7mv4.html">Ýi̊k</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4686 m (15374 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1296, by Ýi̊k. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ýi̊k.</p>
<p>Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf is was constructed arround several premissive paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf's unusual though effective defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

<p>While Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders.

<p>Iängi-glokuw Xluwuf's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

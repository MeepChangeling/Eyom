<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hûyà Ûbochû Gûchya was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1505, by Cú̄shīnḱ Vúóchīy 'Roxy Icemewllo' Ca̋chīkī Ermpfē Vúnvē Ha̋mé Daw̄shīb. The establishment of Hûyà Ûbochû Gûchya  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hûyà Ûbochû Gûchya's construction back out of the project. Cú̄shīnḱ Vúóchīy 'Roxy Icemewllo' Ca̋chīkī Ermpfē Vúnvē Ha̋mé Daw̄shīb pushed on reguardles, and Hûyà Ûbochû Gûchya was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hûyà Ûbochû Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hûyà Ûbochû Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Hûyà Ûbochû Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive gravel streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Hûyà Ûbochû Gûchya's robustly designed timber walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Hûyà Ûbochû Gûchya. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>

<p>The name Îdæ Hubiki Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Îdæ Hubiki Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Glegadopa2spl78i5.html">Glegado</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Îdæ Hubiki Gûchya was founded durring the late 18th century in early spring of the year 1669, by Glegado. The establishment of Îdæ Hubiki Gûchya was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Glegado struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Îdæ Hubiki Gûchya as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Îdæ Hubiki Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Îdæ Hubiki Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Îdæ Hubiki Gûchya is buildings are speckled and packed arround restrictive packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The Ragnarock-era relics have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Îdæ Hubiki Gûchya is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. There’s a patern to the panic. It’s not easy to see, and no one quite agrees on what it is, but the locals know and operate under this pattern. It shapes everything they do, and you feel as if you’ve almost worked it out only for some small detail to devastate your theory every time you try and comprehend it.</p>

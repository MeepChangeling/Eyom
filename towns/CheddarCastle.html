<p>Cheddar Castle (/ˈʧɛdər/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Cheddar Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Cheddar Castle was founded by <a href="../people/GärmJōshīshDeeRoxyYaw̄ySērmp̪f̄rMërmFarrell807w964rty.html">Gärm Jōshīsh 'Dee Roxy' Yaw̄y Sērmp̪f̄r Mërm Farrell</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Cheddar Castle has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Cheddar Castle receives an average of 284 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Cheddar Castle covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 944 m (3097 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cheddar Castle was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1155, by Gärm Jōshīsh 'Dee Roxy' Yaw̄y Sērmp̪f̄r Mërm Farrell. The establishment of Cheddar Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Cheddar Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cheddar Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Cheddar Castle is buildings are built arround a single premissive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Cheddar Castle's millitarily questionable fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Cheddar Castle has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Cheddar Castle’s streets. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as relaxing. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Cheddar Castle is home to a distinct subculture, who are either the majority here or have the dominant positions in the community. Architecture, local laws, and social customs are all tuned to suit them, and they may not be particularly forgiving or friendly to the major culture of the region. Communities that are not outright independent usually make an arm's-length submission to a local lord.</p>
<p>Cheddar Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is long in Cheddar Castle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Lizard.html">Lizard</a> near Cheddar Castle are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Cheddar Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves bloodletting to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 2 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Kad Vätïpo-gháp (/tɑx/ /xə˞p/ [slow] [season (quarter of the year)]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/TrērgslijPrincipality.html">Trērgslij Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Nika.html">Nika</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Vätïpo-gháp is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Vätïpo-gháp was founded by <a href="../people/Vetnorhasi123anr2.html">Vetnorh</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Vätïpo-gháp has a yearly average temperature of 2°C (35°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -20°C (-4°F). Kad Vätïpo-gháp receives an average of 236 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kad Vätïpo-gháp covers an area of nearly 27 km<sup>2</sup> (10 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2906 m (9534 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Vätïpo-gháp was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1502, by Vetnorh. The establishment of Kad Vätïpo-gháp was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Vetnorh electing to pay people to resettle in Kad Vätïpo-gháp.</p>
<p>Kad Vätïpo-gháp was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Vätïpo-gháp is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Kad Vätïpo-gháp is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of broad canals streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Unfortuantly, these exceptionaly well made fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Vätïpo-gháp has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kad Vätïpo-gháp long.</p>

<p>Kad Vätïpo-gháp's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kad Vätïpo-gháp was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kad Vätïpo-gháp lost 191 people, 242 livestock, and 84 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 212, when members of Kad Vätïpo-gháp's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Kad Vätïpo-gháp's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kad Vätïpo-gháp's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v (/du/ /fi̘f/ [kitchen] [curious]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/Biwiē̼ùvCounty.html">Biwiē̼ùv County</a>, <a href="../provences/FtiríhwèsagProvence.html">Ftiríhwèsag Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Shêbêlx72lv2b0g3.html">Shêbêl</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 196 cm/y (77 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 13 km<sup>2</sup> (5 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3082 m (10111 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1350, by Shêbêl. The establishment of Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Shêbêl struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature stone brick construction with most buildings posessing towers, turrets, dormers, and wide wrap-around porches. An extreem emphasis on decorative features and emblishments can be seen even on the poorest of homes and makes even the most humble of structures seem a bit regal.</p>
<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are located arround a single restrictive baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿CobraFlower.html">﻿Cobra Flower</a> near Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves creating small tokens to channel Transmutation energies of tier 3 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v produces some wonderful cultural artifact or trains famous artists. The product might be some exceptional cloth, or artistic luxury good, or the scholarly fruits of a famous academy. Trained artists might be students of a particular school, or the apprentices of the current masters of a long artistic tradition who dwell here.</p>
<p>Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v lost 136 people, 160 livestock, and 37 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 181, when members of Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with the defense of the vault against a siege, which ended in victory for Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Dufi̊f Ji̊ Qi̊v's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Fāèvgi Gíhm (/fəˑ/ /ˈɛvgi/ [wrench] [black; purple; green]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Kshizbāj̼Provence.html">Kshizbāj̼ Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fāèvgi Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Fāèvgi Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Grahrj5vrrg2pb2.html">Grahr</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fāèvgi Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Fāèvgi Gíhm receives an average of 166 cm/y (65 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Fāèvgi Gíhm covers an area of nearly 165 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3744 m (12283 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fāèvgi Gíhm was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1457, by Grahr. The establishment of Fāèvgi Gíhm  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Fāèvgi Gíhm's construction back out of the project. Grahr pushed on reguardles, and Fāèvgi Gíhm was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Fāèvgi Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fāèvgi Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Fāèvgi Gíhm is buildings are built arround a single broad flagstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Fāèvgi Gíhm's brittle defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fāèvgi Gíhm hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fāèvgi Gíhm's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is skipped in Fāèvgi Gíhm.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

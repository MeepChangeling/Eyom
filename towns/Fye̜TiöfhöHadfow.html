<p>The name Fye̜ Tiöfhö Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fye̜ Tiöfhö Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Lisalnn9n5yxlh.html">Lisa</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fye̜ Tiöfhö Hadfow was founded durring the late 17th century in late spring of the year 1584, by Lisa. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Lisa.</p>
<p>Fye̜ Tiöfhö Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fye̜ Tiöfhö Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Fye̜ Tiöfhö Hadfow is was constructed arround several restrictive baked earthen mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Fye̜ Tiöfhö Hadfow, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Fye̜ Tiöfhö Hadfow is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

<p>Novlo Vrevë Gri (/ˈnovlo/ /ˈvrevɛ/ [confident] [victory]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ǞMi̽ttsinölParish.html">Ǟ Mi̽ttsinöl Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/OlaötDiocese.html">Olaöt Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Novlo Vrevë Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Novlo Vrevë Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Emdirilcl44n35rqx.html">Emdiril</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Novlo Vrevë Gri has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Novlo Vrevë Gri receives an average of 145 cm/y (57 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Novlo Vrevë Gri covers an area of nearly 135 km<sup>2</sup> (54 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5040 m (16535 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Novlo Vrevë Gri was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1091, by Emdiril. The establishment of Novlo Vrevë Gri suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Novlo Vrevë Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Novlo Vrevë Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Novlo Vrevë Gri is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Novlo Vrevë Gri's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Novlo Vrevë Gri's budget oriented has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Novlo Vrevë Gri hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Novlo Vrevë Gri's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Novlo Vrevë Gri the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>

<p>Novlo Vrevë Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves bloodletting to channel Mysticism energies of tier 2 via singing.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

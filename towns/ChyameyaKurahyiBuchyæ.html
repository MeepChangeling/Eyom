<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Kurahyi Buchyæ was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1295, by Ktîbë. The establishment of Chyameya Kurahyi Buchyæ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ktîbë struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Chyameya Kurahyi Buchyæ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Chyameya Kurahyi Buchyæ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Kurahyi Buchyæ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Chyameya Kurahyi Buchyæ is buildings are arranged arround a single broad baked earthen mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Unfortuantly, these exceptionaly well made fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Chyameya Kurahyi Buchyæ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Chyameya Kurahyi Buchyæ is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

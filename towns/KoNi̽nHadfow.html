<p>Ko Ni̽n Hadfow (/ko/ /ni̽n/ [cyan] [melody; tune]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/ChyûlàlàâyiKingdom.html">Chyûlàlà âyi Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/Bæru̽saVu̽Empire.html">Bæru̽sa Vu̽ Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ko Ni̽n Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ko Ni̽n Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Relnobib78dkvhub7.html">Relnobi</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ko Ni̽n Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -10°C (14°F). Ko Ni̽n Hadfow receives an average of 301 cm/y (118 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ko Ni̽n Hadfow covers an area of nearly 27 km<sup>2</sup> (10 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3834 m (12578 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ko Ni̽n Hadfow was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1286, by Relnobi. The establishment of Ko Ni̽n Hadfow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Ko Ni̽n Hadfow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Ko Ni̽n Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ko Ni̽n Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Ko Ni̽n Hadfow is buildings are built arround a single restrictive worn bedrock mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The city's robustly designed timber walls are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Ko Ni̽n Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ko Ni̽n Hadfow long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Ko Ni̽n Hadfow is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 6 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Ko Ni̽n Hadfow was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Ko Ni̽n Hadfow. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ko Ni̽n Hadfow lost 223 people, 253 livestock, and 72 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 182, when members of Ko Ni̽n Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to train a group of civilians for a special clandestine operation. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Ko Ni̽n Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ko Ni̽n Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

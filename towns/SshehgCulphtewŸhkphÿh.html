<p>The name Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/Thedoul9pn7az0nij.html">Thedoul</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1485, by Thedoul. The establishment of Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh's construction back out of the project. Thedoul pushed on reguardles, and Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow baked earthen mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh's exceptionaly well made fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh lost 137 people, 138 livestock, and 42 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 77, when members of Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh's militia enacted an operation to deliver supplies to a particular irregulars group. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a stalemate for Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Sshehg Culphtew Ÿhkphÿh's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

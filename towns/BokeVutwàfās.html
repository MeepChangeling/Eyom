<p>Boke Vutwàfās (/ˈvutwə/ /fəˑs/ [emotion] [skinny]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/PesutkrakodaRegion.html">Pesutkrakoda Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Vutwàfās is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Vutwàfās was founded by <a href="../people/Ca̋chīkīMéchvé̄StunnerPrideRéoīVúchīnḱCú̄ń̄nḱ86l8xyztcz.html">Ca̋chīkī Méchvé̄ 'Stunner Pride' Réoī Vúchīnḱ Cú̄ń̄nḱ</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Vutwàfās has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F).

Boke Vutwàfās covers an area of nearly 218 km<sup>2</sup> (87 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6878 m (-20384 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Vutwàfās was founded durring the late 17th century in late summer of the year 1586, by Ca̋chīkī Méchvé̄ 'Stunner Pride' Réoī Vúchīnḱ Cú̄ń̄nḱ. The establishment of Boke Vutwàfās was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ca̋chīkī Méchvé̄ 'Stunner Pride' Réoī Vúchīnḱ Cú̄ń̄nḱ struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Boke Vutwàfās as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Boke Vutwàfās was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Vutwàfās is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Boke Vutwàfās is buildings have been located at convienant points along the swamp Boke Vutwàfās was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the broad baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Boke Vutwàfās's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Astonishigly, the boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Boke Vutwàfās has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Boke Vutwàfās’s streets. A look around Boke Vutwàfās has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Boke Vutwàfās long.</p>

<p>Räz Qec äbony Hasch was founded durring the late 10th century, by Erméchīb Gō̄shī 'Pie Stella' Vú̄tō̄ Nībó̄r Cûfé̄. The establishment of Räz Qec äbony Hasch was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Erméchīb Gō̄shī 'Pie Stella' Vú̄tō̄ Nībó̄r Cûfé̄ struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Räz Qec äbony Hasch as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Räz Qec äbony Hasch was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Qec äbony Hasch is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Qec äbony Hasch is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad packed earth streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Räz Qec äbony Hasch is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Räz Qec äbony Hasch is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>

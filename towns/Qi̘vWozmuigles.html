<p>Qi̘v Wozmuigles (/ˈwozmu/ /ˈigles/ [blasphemy; heresy] [fluent]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/RatgùCounty.html">Ratgù County</a>, <a href="../provences/SidburyLandgrave.html">Sidbury Landgrave</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Wozmuigles is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Wozmuigles was founded by Eritmothra Griffiths, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Wozmuigles has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Qi̘v Wozmuigles receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qi̘v Wozmuigles covers an area of nearly 531 km<sup>2</sup> (212 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4452 m (14606 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Wozmuigles was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1235, by Eritmothra Griffiths. The establishment of Qi̘v Wozmuigles  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Qi̘v Wozmuigles's construction back out of the project. Eritmothra Griffiths pushed on reguardles, and Qi̘v Wozmuigles was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Wozmuigles was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Wozmuigles is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Wozmuigles is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive carved bedrock mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The mountain city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Qi̘v Wozmuigles, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Qi̘v Wozmuigles's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Qi̘v Wozmuigles has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Qi̘v Wozmuigles long.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

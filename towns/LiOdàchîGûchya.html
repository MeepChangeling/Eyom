<p>Li Odàchî Gûchya (/li/ /oˈdəʧɪː/ [great (very large); enormous] [cloak]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/AvûBoruCounty.html">Avû Boru County</a>, <a href="../provences/KàrûS̺æchyæProvence.html">Kàrû S̺æchyæ Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Li Odàchî Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Li Odàchî Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Khrizszihwazrx8l8rx.html">Khrizszih</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Li Odàchî Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Li Odàchî Gûchya receives an average of 247 cm/y (97 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Li Odàchî Gûchya covers an area of nearly 166 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 942 m (3090 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Li Odàchî Gûchya was founded durring the late 17th century in late fall of the year 1651, by Khrizszih. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Khrizszih.</p>
<p>Li Odàchî Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Li Odàchî Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Li Odàchî Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad flagstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The city's would-be-castle fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Li Odàchî Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Li Odàchî Gûchya long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Li Odàchî Gûchya is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Li Odàchî Gûchya's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>=In Li Odàchî Gûchya when drawing, it's impossible to draw an imperfect circle.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Li Odàchî Gûchya was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Li Odàchî Gûchya lost 282 people, 354 livestock, and 47 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 49, when members of Li Odàchî Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to recruit a particular elites group. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Li Odàchî Gûchya's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Li Odàchî Gûchya's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

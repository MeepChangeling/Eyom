<p>Ēji Hu-whänd (/hu/ /whæ̝nd/ [tired (needing sleep); tired (needing rest)] [trunk (of tree); stem]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FolousiaProvince.html">Folousia Province</a> of the <a href="../nations/ConfederationofGoblinTribes.html">Confederation of Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ēji Hu-whänd is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zräysian.html">Gnollish</a> language, as Ēji Hu-whänd was founded by Hylgith vyim Rolɑrtɑeplə˞rd, who was culturaly Gnollish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ēji Hu-whänd has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Ēji Hu-whänd receives an average of 293 cm/y (115 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ēji Hu-whänd covers an area of nearly 266 km<sup>2</sup> (106 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3114 m (10216 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ēji Hu-whänd was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1352, by Hylgith vyim Rolɑrtɑeplə˞rd. The establishment of Ēji Hu-whänd  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ēji Hu-whänd's construction back out of the project. Hylgith vyim Rolɑrtɑeplə˞rd pushed on reguardles, and Ēji Hu-whänd was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ēji Hu-whänd was built using the conventions of Gnollish durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ēji Hu-whänd is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature stone brick construction with most buildings posessing towers, turrets, dormers, and wide wrap-around porches. An extreem emphasis on decorative features and emblishments can be seen even on the poorest of homes and makes even the most humble of structures seem a bit regal.</p>
<p>Ēji Hu-whänd is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive canals streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The valley city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Ēji Hu-whänd's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ēji Hu-whänd hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ēji Hu-whänd's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by grandeur of scale, simplicity of geometric forms, dramatic use of columns, and a preference for blank walls. This design ethos extended to re-imagining earlier styles of structure to create them anew, with a similar overall look and feel to one another..</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Ēji Hu-whänd used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Ēji Hu-whänd.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> killed a tyrannical  who had controlled Ēji Hu-whänd for years. The recitation of the hero's story remains a popular tavern and fair tale.</p>

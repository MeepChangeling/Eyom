<p>Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf (/if/ /æ̝ˈfilf/ [middle] [length]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/Ghotimunrī̄kPrincipality.html">Ghotimunrī̄k Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kaigi.html">Kaigi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf was founded by <a href="../people/Ñaurondurvzrm78kvai.html">Ñaurondur</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a freezing -3°C (27°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf receives an average of 249 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf covers an area of nearly 36 km<sup>2</sup> (14 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2004 m (6574 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1197, by Ñaurondur. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ñaurondur.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive packed earth streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a city of Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf's size could have. The well-designed, yet cheep has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is skipped in Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf.</p>

<p>Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves gestures to channel Conjuration energies of tier 3 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf was struck by a devistating earthquake. The quake brought ruin to Slæ̈rn if-ēfilf, which lost 134 people, 255 livestock, and 54 buildings in the earthquake. The day of the quake is remembered by many as Dread's Day.</p>

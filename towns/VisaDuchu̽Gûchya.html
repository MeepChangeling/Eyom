<p>Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya (/ˈvisa/ /ˈduʧu̽/ [middle] [mattress]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/LakâKâziPrincipality.html">Lakâ Kâzi Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kakoray.html">Kakoray</a>.</p>
<p>The name Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Seletela9vddshlmna.html">Seletela</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 9°C (48°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -6°C (22°F). Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya covers an area of nearly 181 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4798 m (15741 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1302, by Seletela. The establishment of Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Seletela struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brick construction taking the shape of large simple gemometric shapes which ate then embelished with decorative features, but retain their simple shapes in spite of the added features such as pillars, faccaddes, and covered walkways. The blocky nature gives a general impression of extreem age, as if each structure has existed since time immemorial.</p>
<p>Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya is buildings are built arround a single crampt paverstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya's millitarily questionable fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look arround Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya reveals an abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Visa Duchu̽ Gûchya all of the cats speak in a dead language.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

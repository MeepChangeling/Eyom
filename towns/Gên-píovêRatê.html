<p>The name Gên-píovê Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Gên-píovê Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Rhondavij9241kmy.html">Rhonda</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gên-píovê Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Gên-píovê Ratê receives an average of 153 cm/y (60 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Gên-píovê Ratê covers an area of nearly 138 km<sup>2</sup> (55 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4434 m (14547 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gên-píovê Ratê was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1275, by Rhonda. The establishment of Gên-píovê Ratê suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Gên-píovê Ratê which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Gên-píovê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gên-píovê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gên-píovê Ratê is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive paverstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Gên-píovê Ratê's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Looking around Gên-píovê Ratê you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<p>Gên-píovê Ratê is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading.

Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. Interiors will often have a grand stairway and opulent ballroom..</p>

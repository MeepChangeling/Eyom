<p>Năz Yuh Lip (/juh/ /lip/ [orange] [thigh]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/KhramjumaZone.html">Khramjuma Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/KoseniluDistrict.html">Kosenilu District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Alveria.html">Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Năz Yuh Lip is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Năz Yuh Lip was founded by <a href="../people/Az-20wAP-5wr64jb61ik.html">Az-20w 'AP-5'</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Năz Yuh Lip has a yearly average temperature of 32°C (89°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 36°C (96°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 29°C (84°F). Năz Yuh Lip receives an average of 114 cm/y (44 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Năz Yuh Lip covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8142 m (-16237 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Năz Yuh Lip was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1262, by Az-20w 'AP-5'. The establishment of Năz Yuh Lip suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Năz Yuh Lip was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Năz Yuh Lip is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Năz Yuh Lip is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive paverstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The city's exceptionaly well made fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Năz Yuh Lip has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Năz Yuh Lip long.</p>

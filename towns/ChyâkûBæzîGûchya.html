<p>Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya (/ˈləsæ/ /ˈbæzɪː/ [arrogant] [gum]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/LakâKâziPrincipality.html">Lakâ Kâzi Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kakoray.html">Kakoray</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Echinoideah4npsr0jgh.html">Echinoidea</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya receives an average of 240 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya covers an area of nearly 145 km<sup>2</sup> (58 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4570 m (14993 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1401, by Echinoidea. The establishment of Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya is was constructed arround several spacious worn bedrock mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya long.</p>

<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>The center of Chyâkû Bæzî Gûchya's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>

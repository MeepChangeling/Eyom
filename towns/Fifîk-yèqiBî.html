<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî (/fiˈtëvɪ/ /ˈjèqi/ [dirty] [voice]) is a temperate Town located in the <a href="../provences/FîthdekîZone.html">Fîthdekî Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fifîk-yèqi Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Fifîk-yèqi Bî was founded by <a href="../people/AleddynShêpîtcorfcpj34wcx.html">Aleddyn Shêpîtco</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Fifîk-yèqi Bî receives an average of 222 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Fifîk-yèqi Bî covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 272 m (892 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1056, by Aleddyn Shêpîtco. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Aleddyn Shêpîtco.</p>
<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fifîk-yèqi Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt canals streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Unfortuantly, these exceptionaly well made fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Fifîk-yèqi Bî has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Fifîk-yèqi Bî long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Fifîk-yèqi Bî.

<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is recurring in Fifîk-yèqi Bî.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿BegedhiSeedling.html">﻿Begedhi, Seedling</a> near Fifîk-yèqi Bî are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves orgies to channel Summoning energies of tier 3 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Fifîk-yèqi Bî used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Fifîk-yèqi Bî.</p>

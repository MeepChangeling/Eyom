<p>The name Ftshqàgà Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ftshqàgà Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Trîmik3l9f8l7p.html">Trîm</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ftshqàgà Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Ftshqàgà Gíhm receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Ftshqàgà Gíhm covers an area of nearly 33 km<sup>2</sup> (13 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4586 m (15045 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ftshqàgà Gíhm was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1346, by Trîm. The establishment of Ftshqàgà Gíhm suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ftshqàgà Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ftshqàgà Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Ftshqàgà Gíhm is buildings are speckled and packed arround crampt gravel streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Ftshqàgà Gíhm's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Unfortuantly, these budget oriented are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Ftshqàgà Gíhm gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Ftshqàgà Gíhm brings to mind.</p>

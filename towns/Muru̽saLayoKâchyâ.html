<p>The name Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Tukhaekara8kb2hnpcy0.html">Tukhaekara</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1288, by Tukhaekara. The establishment of Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tukhaekara struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ is was constructed arround several crampt cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ makes you wonder how anything ever gets done. The locals have clear, obvious rivalries with one another, as seen through clenched teeth and fake smiles. What’s more, there is a serious lack of any organization and planning in Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ’s layout as well as the local’s behaviors. The city seems to be a den of chaos where tongues are forked and local customs do not exist.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Muru̽sa Layo Kâchyâ's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>

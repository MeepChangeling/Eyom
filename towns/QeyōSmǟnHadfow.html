<p>Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow (/ˈqejoː/ /smaːn/ [serious; obese] [diner]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MiqtpsukheMoot.html">Miqtpsukhe Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Bhorlisvu89w9i2xv.html">Bhorlis</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F). Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow receives an average of 133 cm/y (52 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow covers an area of nearly 158 km<sup>2</sup> (63 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4886 m (16030 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow was founded durring the late 17th century in late fall of the year 1568, by Bhorlis. The establishment of Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Bhorlis struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

Some communities may suffer a longer-term version of this, their youths lost in a grinding, endless battle against some perpetual threat.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow lost 149 people, 242 livestock, and 73 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 206, when members of Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy mage. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qeyō Smǟn Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

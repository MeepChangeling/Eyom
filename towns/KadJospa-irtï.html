<p>Kad Jospa-irtï (/josˈpa/ /irˈtɪ/ [bad] [skin; fur; leather]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SlïrddámsPrincipality.html">Slïrddáms Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Cochi.html">Cochi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Jospa-irtï is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Jospa-irtï was founded by <a href="../people/Ch́åbi3137w2rl.html">Ch́å</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Jospa-irtï has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 2°C (35°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Kad Jospa-irtï receives an average of 205 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Kad Jospa-irtï covers an area of nearly 102 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2400 m (7874 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Jospa-irtï was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1319, by Ch́å. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ch́å.</p>
<p>Kad Jospa-irtï was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Jospa-irtï is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kad Jospa-irtï is buildings have been located at convienant points along the lake Kad Jospa-irtï was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow split-log ties streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Kad Jospa-irtï's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Jospa-irtï has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kad Jospa-irtï long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Kad Jospa-irtï's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, curved windows, and decorative trim work. .</p>

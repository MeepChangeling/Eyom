<p>Kèr  Gùgbíhdran (/gʊg/ /ˈbɪ̞dran/ [guide] [beautiful]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/KveviēidRegion.html">Kveviēid Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kèr  Gùgbíhdran is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Kèr  Gùgbíhdran was founded by <a href="../people/BēyVú̄kīDazzleCherishCōshīkīMēsMa̋mbónḱBelíhgāyia7zirsr5.html">Bēy Vú̄kī 'Dazzle Cherish' Cōshīkī Mēs Ma̋mbónḱ Belíhgā</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kèr  Gùgbíhdran has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Kèr  Gùgbíhdran receives an average of 152 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Kèr  Gùgbíhdran covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4512 m (14803 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kèr  Gùgbíhdran was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1325, by Bēy Vú̄kī 'Dazzle Cherish' Cōshīkī Mēs Ma̋mbónḱ Belíhgā. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Bēy Vú̄kī 'Dazzle Cherish' Cōshīkī Mēs Ma̋mbónḱ Belíhgā.</p>
<p>Kèr  Gùgbíhdran was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kèr  Gùgbíhdran is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kèr  Gùgbíhdran is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of broad baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  town rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Astonishigly, the millitarily questionable fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kèr  Gùgbíhdran hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Kèr  Gùgbíhdran is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Life is hard in Kèr  Gùgbíhdran. Its people are impoverished compared to their peers elsewhere. Something is making the locals stay, however, whether fear of the alternative, hope for a better future, or a stubborn attachment to their ancestral lands. Whatver the reason, living in this harsh area for generations has made the people of Kèr  Gùgbíhdran a notably resourceful and hearty people.</p>
<p>Kèr  Gùgbíhdran's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Kèr  Gùgbíhdran it is impossible to directly or indirectly lie.</p>

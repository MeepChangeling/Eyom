<p>Àdrowaj Gíhm (/ˈədro/ /waj/ [lion] [evil]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/TstifurRegion.html">Tstifur Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Àdrowaj Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Àdrowaj Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Èdsíklh93mrijc.html">Èdsí</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Àdrowaj Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Àdrowaj Gíhm receives an average of 268 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Àdrowaj Gíhm covers an area of nearly 43 km<sup>2</sup> (17 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 434 m (1423 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Àdrowaj Gíhm was founded durring the late 19th century in early winter of the year 1780, by Èdsí. The establishment of Àdrowaj Gíhm was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Èdsí struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Àdrowaj Gíhm as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Àdrowaj Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 19th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Àdrowaj Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Àdrowaj Gíhm is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Àdrowaj Gíhm was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Àdrowaj Gíhm, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Àdrowaj Gíhm.</p>

<p>Àdrowaj Gíhm's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

<p>Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ˈjʊgəˑ/ /tɪ̞r/ [creek] [medicine]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/VātuchàjùRegion.html">Vātuchàjù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Balcheth0r03jdcjhw.html">Balcheth</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 252 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 87 km<sup>2</sup> (34 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1750 m (5741 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 17th century in late summer of the year 1645, by Balcheth. The establishment of Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v's construction back out of the project. Balcheth pushed on reguardles, and Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It’s a quiet city filled with closed scriptoriums, people quietly yet dejectedly reading in isolated places around town, and the occasional book laying in a heap of garbage.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Jùgātíhr Ji̊ Qi̊v suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Mere Brokopondo began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which devastated , killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. An estimated  people,  livestock, and  buildings were lost to the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Horror Wind.</p>

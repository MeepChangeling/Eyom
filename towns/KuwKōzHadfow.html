<p>The name Kuw Kōz Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kuw Kōz Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Mlêbê74p9jr25fc.html">Mlêbê</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kuw Kōz Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F).

Kuw Kōz Hadfow covers an area of nearly 135 km<sup>2</sup> (54 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6340 m (20800 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kuw Kōz Hadfow was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1191, by Mlêbê. The establishment of Kuw Kōz Hadfow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Kuw Kōz Hadfow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Kuw Kōz Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kuw Kōz Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Kuw Kōz Hadfow is buildings are arranged within a network of narrow paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Kuw Kōz Hadfow's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Kuw Kōz Hadfow makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kuw Kōz Hadfow's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>=In Kuw Kōz Hadfow when drawing, it's impossible to draw an imperfect circle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Faun.html">Faun</a> near Kuw Kōz Hadfow are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Kuw Kōz Hadfow's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves ritual combat to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 2 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä (/ʌ̋/ /ʌ̂ɜː/ [native] [sketch]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Īchnḱyǐyátzmb̪vRegion.html">Īchnḱyǐyátzmb̪v Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/NurarnuliReirgamiGatkb5pgvpacj.html">Nurarnuli Reirgami Gat</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F). Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 298 cm/y (117 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 209 km<sup>2</sup> (83 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3676 m (12060 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1177, by Nurarnuli Reirgami Gat. The establishment of Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Nurarnuli Reirgami Gat struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Mǎv Ûer Ni̋ēkēä was like during the glorydays.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

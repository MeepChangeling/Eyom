<p>Hugletts Castle (/hugletts/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate City located in <a href="../subprovences/GreycastleDutchy.html">Greycastle Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/IpoulanKingdom.html">Ipoulan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hugletts Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hugletts Castle was founded by <a href="../people/SusannaNealwwf7riw8d9.html">Susanna Neal</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hugletts Castle has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Hugletts Castle receives an average of 276 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Hugletts Castle covers an area of nearly 24 km<sup>2</sup> (9 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 922 m (3024 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hugletts Castle was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1300, by Susanna Neal. The establishment of Hugletts Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hugletts Castle's construction back out of the project. Susanna Neal pushed on reguardles, and Hugletts Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hugletts Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hugletts Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Hugletts Castle is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive split-log ties streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Hugletts Castle's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Hugletts Castle gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. A second look around Hugletts Castle makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Hugletts Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Hugletts Castle there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Hugletts Castle is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Hugletts Castle was struck by unseasonably warm weather, causing a sweltering heat to smouther the land for 16 days. Hugletts Castle lost 153 people and  239 livestock in the disaster.. The deadly heat is remembered by most as the Horror's Flame.</p>

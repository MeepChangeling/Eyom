<p>The name Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Thozhkay0zs1vzd9bj.html">Thozhkay</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1279, by Thozhkay. The establishment of Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Thozhkay struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<p>Hu̹chyelà Hûkiya Kâchyâ's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>

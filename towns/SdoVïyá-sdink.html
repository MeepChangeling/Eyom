<p>Sdo Vïyá-sdink ([root words not on file] [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Metropolis located in the <a href="../provences/KiklajsuzuHeath.html">Kiklajsuzu Heath</a> of the <a href="../nations/heath.html">heath</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sdo Vïyá-sdink is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Sdo Vïyá-sdink was founded by Ditela Thiselton-Dyer Nash Willins Evans, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Sdo Vïyá-sdink covers an area of nearly 423 km<sup>2</sup> (169 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3324 m (10905 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sdo Vïyá-sdink was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1371, by Ditela Thiselton-Dyer Nash Willins Evans. The establishment of Sdo Vïyá-sdink  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Sdo Vïyá-sdink's construction back out of the project. Ditela Thiselton-Dyer Nash Willins Evans pushed on reguardles, and Sdo Vïyá-sdink was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Sdo Vïyá-sdink was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sdo Vïyá-sdink is no diffrent. The metropolis's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Sdo Vïyá-sdink is was constructed arround several narrow baked earthen mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The valley metropolis is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Sdo Vïyá-sdink's Ragnarock-era relics are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the metropolis as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Sdo Vïyá-sdink gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Sdo Vïyá-sdink brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Eyom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Kle̜ Iiëk Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kle̜ Iiëk Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Gryriorthjqpxflrhpw.html">Gryriorth</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kle̜ Iiëk Hadfow was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1053, by Gryriorth. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Gryriorth.</p>
<p>Kle̜ Iiëk Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kle̜ Iiëk Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Kle̜ Iiëk Hadfow is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Kle̜ Iiëk Hadfow was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Kle̜ Iiëk Hadfow's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>

<p>Tishnàkèd Gíhm (/ˈtiʃnə/ /kɛd/ [cult] [intricate]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ZåkräfRegion.html">Zåkräf Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tishnàkèd Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tishnàkèd Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Emdiriljw1vu7iv9j.html">Emdiril</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tishnàkèd Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 30°C (86°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Tishnàkèd Gíhm receives an average of 179 cm/y (70 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Tishnàkèd Gíhm covers an area of nearly 181 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5226 m (17145 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tishnàkèd Gíhm was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1270, by Emdiril. The establishment of Tishnàkèd Gíhm suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Tishnàkèd Gíhm which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Tishnàkèd Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tishnàkèd Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Tishnàkèd Gíhm is buildings are built arround a single narrow baked earthen mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Tishnàkèd Gíhm's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Tishnàkèd Gíhm's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Tishnàkèd Gíhm gives you a feeling of distrust and paranoia. Also greed. The locals seem to be very much into scholastic pursuits, based on the hushed, murmured conversations you hear at least. Everyone in Tishnàkèd Gíhm acts like they have discovered something wondrous, and are worried they will endure some horrible fate so another can take what they’ve discovered for themselves.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Tishnàkèd Gíhm's locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Tishnàkèd Gíhm's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Tishnàkèd Gíhm was attacked by savage scorpionfolks living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Tishnàkèd Gíhm lost 105 people, 395 livestock, and 97 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 168, when members of Tishnàkèd Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a stalemate for Tishnàkèd Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Tishnàkèd Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

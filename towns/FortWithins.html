<p>Fort Withins (/wɪˈðɪnz/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Withins is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Withins was founded by <a href="../people/Zesëg̈mNiccol6702v3inkx.html">Zesëg̈m Niccol</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Withins has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Fort Withins receives an average of 257 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Fort Withins covers an area of nearly 47 km<sup>2</sup> (18 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1350 m (4429 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Withins was founded durring the late 17th century in early summer of the year 1565, by Zesëg̈m Niccol. The establishment of Fort Withins suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Fort Withins was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Withins is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Fort Withins is buildings are arranged within a network of crampt baked earthen streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Fort Withins's exceptionaly well made fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fort Withins hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fort Withins's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Fort Withins tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿Thoqqua.html">﻿Thoqqua</a> near Fort Withins are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Fort Withins's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves orgies to channel Necromancy energies of tier 2 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

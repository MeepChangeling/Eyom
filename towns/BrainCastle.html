<p>Brain Castle (/breɪn/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Seóvmbaw̄äProvence.html">Seóvmbaw̄ä Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Brain Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Brain Castle was founded by <a href="../people/GiantAssassinSpidersAmbler361blli61p.html">Giant Assassin Spiders Ambler</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Brain Castle has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Brain Castle receives an average of 274 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Brain Castle covers an area of nearly 149 km<sup>2</sup> (59 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2418 m (7933 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Brain Castle was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1492, by Giant Assassin Spiders Ambler. The establishment of Brain Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Giant Assassin Spiders Ambler struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Brain Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Brain Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Brain Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Brain Castle is buildings are located arround a single narrow paverstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Brain Castle's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Brain Castle's budget oriented are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Brain Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<p>Brain Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is short in Brain Castle.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

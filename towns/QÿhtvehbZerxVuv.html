<p>The name Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv was founded by <a href="../people/Grraegrurthyu8quccwuf.html">Grraegrurth</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv receives an average of 285 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv covers an area of nearly 180 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1728 m (5669 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv was founded durring the late 16th century in winter of the year 1497, by Grraegrurth. The establishment of Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv's construction back out of the project. Grraegrurth pushed on reguardles, and Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Boar.html">Boar</a> near Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Zerx Vuv's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves creating small tokens to channel Illusion energies of tier 3 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

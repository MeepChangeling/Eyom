<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyàchyæmu Bahæ Gûchya was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1126, by Mp̪vēshī Rēy 'Hot Pearllilyz' Hä̋nḱ Mp̪fēy Mbō̌. The establishment of Chyàchyæmu Bahæ Gûchya suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Chyàchyæmu Bahæ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyàchyæmu Bahæ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyàchyæmu Bahæ Gûchya is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Chyàchyæmu Bahæ Gûchya's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The top tier civilian fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Chyàchyæmu Bahæ Gûchya has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking.

But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures.

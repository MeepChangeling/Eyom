<p>Vǟlǟs-lör Gri (/ˈvaːlaːs/ /lo˞r/ [shooting star] [claw]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WǟlwuMoot.html">Wǟlwu Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vǟlǟs-lör Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Vǟlǟs-lör Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Danieb0dxsgjbpb.html">Danie</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vǟlǟs-lör Gri has a yearly average temperature of 9°C (48°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -7°C (20°F). Vǟlǟs-lör Gri receives an average of 307 cm/y (120 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Vǟlǟs-lör Gri covers an area of nearly 95 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1516 m (4973 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vǟlǟs-lör Gri was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1093, by Danie. The establishment of Vǟlǟs-lör Gri suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Vǟlǟs-lör Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vǟlǟs-lör Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Vǟlǟs-lör Gri is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of broad canals streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Vǟlǟs-lör Gri's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Unfortuantly, these unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Vǟlǟs-lör Gri seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Vǟlǟs-lör Gri the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Vǟlǟs-lör Gri's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Vǟlǟs-lör Gri sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Dap Qàjbíhdran (/qəʤ/ /ˈbɪ̞dran/ [goose] [beautiful]) is a tropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/DunsmouthCommunity.html">Dunsmouth Community</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dap Qàjbíhdran is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Dap Qàjbíhdran was founded by Gwoneth Morgan, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dap Qàjbíhdran has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Dap Qàjbíhdran receives an average of 145 cm/y (57 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Dap Qàjbíhdran covers an area of nearly 268 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3354 m (11003 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dap Qàjbíhdran was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1392, by Gwoneth Morgan. The establishment of Dap Qàjbíhdran suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Dap Qàjbíhdran was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dap Qàjbíhdran is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Dap Qàjbíhdran is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive paverstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The valley city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The would-be-castle fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Dap Qàjbíhdran has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Dap Qàjbíhdran’s streets. A look around Dap Qàjbíhdran has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Dap Qàjbíhdran long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Dap Qàjbíhdran is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea (28536 % 6)+1 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Dap Qàjbíhdran was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Dap Qàjbíhdran. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Dap Qàjbíhdran lost 160 people, 330 livestock, and 65 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 97, when members of Dap Qàjbíhdran's militia enacted an operation to recruit a specific 's family member. The operation was complicated by gale force winds which drowned out orders and hampered ranged combat. The conflict ended with the defense of the fortification against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Dap Qàjbíhdran's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Dap Qàjbíhdran's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

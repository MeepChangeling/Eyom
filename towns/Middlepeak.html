<p>Middlepeak (/ˈmɪdl/ /piːk/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/WindkeepDutchy.html">Windkeep Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/CastfordiaLandgrave.html">Castfordia Landgrave</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Middlepeak is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Middlepeak was founded by Zlkdsh Laster, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Middlepeak has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Middlepeak receives an average of 162 cm/y (63 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Middlepeak covers an area of nearly 452 km<sup>2</sup> (180 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4574 m (15006 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Middlepeak was founded in time immemorial, reportedly some time durring the late 8th century, by Zlkdsh Laster. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Zlkdsh Laster.</p>
<p>Middlepeak was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 8th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Middlepeak is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Middlepeak is was constructed arround several narrow carved bedrock mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The mountain city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Middlepeak's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Astonishigly, the budget oriented are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Middlepeak seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Middlepeak's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Middlepeak.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Middlepeak’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Middlepeak’s streets.</p>

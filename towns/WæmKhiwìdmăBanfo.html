<p>The name Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo was founded by <a href="../people/SyllaemusTrgfêTrtesîxmzy9licss.html">Syllaemus Trgfê Trtesî</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo receives an average of 205 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5666 m (18589 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1218, by Syllaemus Trgfê Trtesî. The establishment of Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Syllaemus Trgfê Trtesî struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo is buildings are arranged arround a single broad canals mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the town a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  town has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the town is well defended against anything short of an army. Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo's cost-cutting-focused defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the town nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the town, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Domovoi.html">Domovoi</a> near Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Illusion energies of tier 3 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo was attacked by a group of nobles with their private armies. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo lost 133 people, 279 livestock, and 69 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 83, when members of Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular port intact. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a crushing defeat for Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Wæm Khiwìdmă Banfo's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

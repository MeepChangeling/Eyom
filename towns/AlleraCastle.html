<p>Allera Castle (/ˈɔlər/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GumadaProvence.html">Gumada Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Allera Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Allera Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TselêdHazelld4zupytacm.html">Tselêd Hazell</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Allera Castle has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Allera Castle receives an average of 280 cm/y (110 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Allera Castle covers an area of nearly 112 km<sup>2</sup> (44 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2966 m (9730 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Allera Castle was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1280, by Tselêd Hazell. The establishment of Allera Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tselêd Hazell struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Allera Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Allera Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Allera Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Allera Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of broad paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Allera Castle's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Allera Castle has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Allera Castle, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>

<p>Allera Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Allera Castle was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Allera Castle lost 236 people, 193 livestock, and 40 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 52, when members of Allera Castle's militia enacted an operation to train a group of civilians for a special clandestine operation. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the ruin, which ended in defeat for Allera Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Allera Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

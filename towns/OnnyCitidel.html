<p>Onny Citidel (/onny/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BāwkyoīäProvence.html">Bāwkyoīä Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Onny Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Onny Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/TsèbêvMaddisonfc4qnsclc5.html">Tsèbêv Maddison</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Onny Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Onny Citidel receives an average of 268 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Onny Citidel covers an area of nearly 216 km<sup>2</sup> (86 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4424 m (14514 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Onny Citidel was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1070, by Tsèbêv Maddison. The establishment of Onny Citidel suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Onny Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Onny Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Onny Citidel is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of broad flagstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The millitarily questionable fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Onny Citidel has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Onny Citidel’s streets. In spite of this, quite a few people can be seen reading and the city has an abundance of libraries. It’s quite clear the community values education.</p>

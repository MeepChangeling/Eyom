<p>Boke Kowbedbù (/kow/ /ˈbedbʊ/ [pest; bully] [brief]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KveviēidRegion.html">Kveviēid Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Kowbedbù is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Kowbedbù was founded by <a href="../people/Aripiusng3avbdaxs.html">Aripius</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Kowbedbù has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Boke Kowbedbù receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Boke Kowbedbù covers an area of nearly 77 km<sup>2</sup> (30 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3882 m (12736 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Kowbedbù was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1262, by Aripius. The establishment of Boke Kowbedbù was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Aripius struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Boke Kowbedbù as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Boke Kowbedbù was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Kowbedbù is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Kowbedbù is buildings are located arround a single premissive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The exceptionaly well made fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Kowbedbù has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Boke Kowbedbù long.</p>

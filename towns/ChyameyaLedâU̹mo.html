<p>The name Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo was founded by <a href="../people/Hèsi0ha9dssvr7.html">Hèsi</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1232, by Hèsi. The establishment of Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo's construction back out of the project. Hèsi pushed on reguardles, and Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo is is constructed  arround a series of narrow carved bedrock mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo long.</p>

The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo lost 279 people, 163 livestock, and 33 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 156, when members of Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by thick blankets of fog, which hid friend and foe alike. The conflict ended with the defense of the fortification against a siege, which ended in defeat for Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Chyameya Ledâ U̹mo's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

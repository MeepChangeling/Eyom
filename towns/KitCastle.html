<p>Kit Castle (/kɪt/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kit Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kit Castle was founded by <a href="../people/YmvieshSaxbywbgb6l9nja.html">Ymviesh Saxby</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kit Castle has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Kit Castle receives an average of 283 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Kit Castle covers an area of nearly 141 km<sup>2</sup> (56 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1268 m (4160 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kit Castle was founded durring the late 11th century, by Ymviesh Saxby. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Kit Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kit Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Kit Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of broad baked earthen streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Kit Castle's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Kit Castle has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Kit Castle’s streets. Yet, deep down, you know this atmosphere is a carefully created illusion. You can see the ocasional seam in their tapestry. You’re not sure what has them doing their best to act so carefree, but act carefree they do.</p>

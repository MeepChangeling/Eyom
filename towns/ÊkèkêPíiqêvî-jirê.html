<p>Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê (/p˔iˈqɘvɪ/ /ˈʤirɘ/ [sexual] [saliva]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/JajëhifitëZone.html">Jajëhifitë Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê was founded by <a href="../people/Crocodes6c8477k1dt.html">Crocodes</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê receives an average of 275 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê covers an area of nearly 140 km<sup>2</sup> (56 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3010 m (9875 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1122, by Crocodes. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Crocodes.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow baked earthen streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Unfortuantly, these political statment focused walls are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is skipped in Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Festrog.html">Festrog</a> near Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Píiqêvî-jirê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves orgies to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 2 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

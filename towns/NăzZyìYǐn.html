<p>The name Năz Zyì Yǐn is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Năz Zyì Yǐn was founded by <a href="../people/Io-29wCrunchdgrfi2w258.html">Io-29w 'Crunch'</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Năz Zyì Yǐn has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Năz Zyì Yǐn receives an average of 150 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Năz Zyì Yǐn covers an area of nearly 129 km<sup>2</sup> (51 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6676 m (-21046 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Năz Zyì Yǐn was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1091, by Io-29w 'Crunch'. The establishment of Năz Zyì Yǐn suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Năz Zyì Yǐn which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Năz Zyì Yǐn was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Năz Zyì Yǐn is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Năz Zyì Yǐn is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Năz Zyì Yǐn's robustly designed timber walls are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Năz Zyì Yǐn seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>

The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape.

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Năz Zyì Yǐn's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Năz Zyì Yǐn was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Năz Zyì Yǐn lost 111 people, 240 livestock, and 72 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 206, when members of Năz Zyì Yǐn's militia enacted an operation to fortify a particular fortification. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Năz Zyì Yǐn's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Năz Zyì Yǐn's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

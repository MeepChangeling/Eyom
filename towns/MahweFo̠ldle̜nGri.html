<p>Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1412, by Sanare Cothiel Hithwen. The establishment of Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The city's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri lost 147 people, 116 livestock, and 65 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 189, when members of Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri's militia enacted an operation to train a specific solgiers group for an upcoming operation. The operation was complicated by extremely dangerous terrain, including unfamiliar and poisonous plants which many ate while foraging. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Mahwe Fo̠ldle̜n Gri's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm (Tshi /ˈzɛjʃa/ [drugstore] [interview]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/IēibonjāmRegion.html">Iēibonjām Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tshizèiēsha Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tshizèiēsha Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Panazy6san171j.html">Pana</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Tshizèiēsha Gíhm receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Tshizèiēsha Gíhm covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 76 m (249 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1266, by Pana. The establishment of Tshizèiēsha Gíhm suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tshizèiēsha Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm is buildings are arranged arround a single spacious cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Tshizèiēsha Gíhm's brittle defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Tshizèiēsha Gíhm’s streets. In spite of this, quite a few people can be seen reading and the city has an abundance of libraries. It’s quite clear the community values education.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. In spite of the Galvanic Grid, these lights continue to use their old fule sources to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Tshizèiēsha Gíhm.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Xtabay.html">Xtabay</a> near Tshizèiēsha Gíhm are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves gestures to channel Transmutation energies of tier 1 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Tshizèiēsha Gíhm's residents established a new industry 4 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>

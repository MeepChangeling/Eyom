<p>Igē-ne Xluwuf (/iˈgæ̝/ /ne/ [passive] [cage; prison; jail]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ZäntnräwPrincipality.html">Zäntnräw Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Konei.html">Konei</a>.</p>
<p>The name Igē-ne Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Igē-ne Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Damiensmiiry1m1n.html">Damien</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Igē-ne Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 0°C (32°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 9°C (48°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -9°C (16°F). Igē-ne Xluwuf receives an average of 201 cm/y (79 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Igē-ne Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 242 km<sup>2</sup> (96 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3466 m (11371 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Igē-ne Xluwuf was founded durring the early 10th century, by Damien. The establishment of Igē-ne Xluwuf was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Damien struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Igē-ne Xluwuf as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Igē-ne Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Igē-ne Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Igē-ne Xluwuf is buildings are arranged within a network of premissive flagstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Igē-ne Xluwuf's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Igē-ne Xluwuf proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Igē-ne Xluwuf is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Igē-ne Xluwuf is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1550, by Shêj. The establishment of Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Shêj struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad flagstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Êkèkê Mêndê-fênê long.</p>

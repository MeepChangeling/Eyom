<p>Sothê-êtha Îè (/ˈsoʃɘ/ /ˈɘθa/ [obese] [top; mountain; peak]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SshaumerilelCounty.html">Sshaumerilel County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sothê-êtha Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Sothê-êtha Îè was founded by Snoctî, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sothê-êtha Îè has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Sothê-êtha Îè receives an average of 164 cm/y (64 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Sothê-êtha Îè covers an area of nearly 271 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5018 m (16463 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sothê-êtha Îè was founded durring the late 10th century, by Snoctî. The establishment of Sothê-êtha Îè suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Sothê-êtha Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sothê-êtha Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Sothê-êtha Îè is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The mountain city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Sothê-êtha Îè's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual though effective defenses has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Sothê-êtha Îè. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them.</p>

<p>Sothê-êtha Îè is accessed from a nearby river via an intricate series of locks.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Dräf-æ̈rïtsïkwi Forest was struck by a drought when Tarn Ratfish grew too small to continue feeding Creek Arching, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Sothê-êtha Îè. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Sothê-êtha Îè lost 266 people, and 217 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 3 weeks, which are remembered as the Heartbreak Thirst.</p>

<p>Derwent Castle (/derwent/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in the <a href="../provences/IzcleaRegion.html">Izclea Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Derwent Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Derwent Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ShëgadoGreeneux02jzs9ha.html">Shëgado Greene</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Derwent Castle has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Derwent Castle receives an average of 267 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Derwent Castle covers an area of nearly 15 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4270 m (14009 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Derwent Castle was founded durring the late 17th century in early winter of the year 1565, by Shëgado Greene. The establishment of Derwent Castle was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Shëgado Greene electing to pay people to resettle in Derwent Castle.</p>
<p>Derwent Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Derwent Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Derwent Castle is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Derwent Castle's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Derwent Castle has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Derwent Castle ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Derwent Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>In Derwent Castle rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LeshyGourd.html">Leshy, Gourd</a> near Derwent Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Derwent Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves reenactments to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 2 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 6 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with good fortune for a year and a day. One of Derwent Castle's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

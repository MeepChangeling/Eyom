<p>Yet Mniwbë Gri (/jet/ /ˈmniwbɛ/ [gay; homosexual] [telegraph]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Fle̜költyoMoot.html">Fle̜költyo Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Yet Mniwbë Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Yet Mniwbë Gri was founded by <a href="../people/YawmbGa̋ń̄̌KylieOpheliaMé̄kīyHaw̋chīMp̪f̄shvptj5xy5u58.html">Yawmb Ga̋ń̄̌ 'Kylie Ophelia' Mé̄kīy Haw̋chī Mp̪f̄shv</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Yet Mniwbë Gri has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Yet Mniwbë Gri receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Yet Mniwbë Gri covers an area of nearly 180 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4042 m (13261 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yet Mniwbë Gri was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1078, by Yawmb Ga̋ń̄̌ 'Kylie Ophelia' Mé̄kīy Haw̋chī Mp̪f̄shv. The establishment of Yet Mniwbë Gri was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Yawmb Ga̋ń̄̌ 'Kylie Ophelia' Mé̄kīy Haw̋chī Mp̪f̄shv struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Yet Mniwbë Gri as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Yet Mniwbë Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yet Mniwbë Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Yet Mniwbë Gri is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive packed earth streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Yet Mniwbë Gri, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Yet Mniwbë Gri has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Yet Mniwbë Gri long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Yet Mniwbë Gri has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Yet Mniwbë Gri's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Yet Mniwbë Gri all of the cats speak the local language with prefect diction.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Soulsliver.html">Soulsliver</a> near Yet Mniwbë Gri are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Yet Mniwbë Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves reenactments to channel Illusion energies of tier 2 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Yet Mniwbë Gri is surrounded by dangerous terrain: miasmatic swamps, perilous crevasses, radioactive badlands, a pocket of or some other harmful topography. Yet Mniwbë Gri might prefer the defensive potential of the terrain here, or have found a precious resource worth the danger. The terrain might have formed at some time since the founding, with the citizens struggling to make terms with the new danger.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Yet Mniwbë Gri is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Lake Tauca began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which brought great calamity to the entire nation, killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. The disaster brought an end to  people,  livestock, and  buildings. The disaster is referred to as the Agony Wind.</p>

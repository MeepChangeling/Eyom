<p>Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v (Híhtíh /ˈkɪ̞ka/ [counter (flat; elevated surface)] [adventure]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/IēibonjāmRegion.html">Iēibonjām Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Zlèsëwspcqxlfmk.html">Zlèsë</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 233 cm/y (91 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1784 m (5853 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 11th century, by Zlèsë. The establishment of Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Híhtíhkíhka Ji̊ Qi̊v is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>The name Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/Zèqth2nmmxsp4u9.html">Zèqth</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1061, by Zèqth. The establishment of Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Zèqth struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are located arround a single spacious flagstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual though effective defenses are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Åzett Ÿyächu Ÿhkphÿh long.</p>

<p>Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms (/wajj/ /æ̝ms/ [best] [intestine]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/DigitznäPrincipality.html">Digitznä Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Nika.html">Nika</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms was founded by <a href="../people/Nesoic0zhrfvfnn1.html">Nesoic</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1149, by Nesoic. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious flagstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Looking around Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<p>Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms lost 134 people, 206 livestock, and 73 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 34, when members of Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to another of their nation's army, then reinforce them. The operation was complicated by a natural disaster interrupted the operation, shattering unit cohesion. The conflict ended with the defense of the ruin against a siege, which ended in defeat for Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Slæ̈rn Ipotijo-äms's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

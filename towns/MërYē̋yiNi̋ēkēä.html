<p>Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä (/mɜ̄ː/ /jæ̋jiː/ [mauve] [soil; dust; clay; brick]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/JǎlēyeēyRegion.html">Jǎlēyeēy Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/Ra̋gYóoīDepthVioletMpf̄nvoīCúó̄nḱGa̋chvēbCä̋Yä̌shvé̄k6up76cmj9.html">Ra̋g Yóoī 'Depth Violet' Mpf̄nvoī Cúó̄nḱ Ga̋chvēb Cä̋ Yä̌shvé̄</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 18°C (64°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 256 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 253 km<sup>2</sup> (101 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1092 m (3582 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1267, by Ra̋g Yóoī 'Depth Violet' Mpf̄nvoī Cúó̄nḱ Ga̋chvēb Cä̋ Yä̌shvé̄. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ra̋g Yóoī 'Depth Violet' Mpf̄nvoī Cúó̄nḱ Ga̋chvēb Cä̋ Yä̌shvé̄.</p>
<p>Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä is is constructed arround a semi-circular narrow packed earth mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mër Yē̋yi Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

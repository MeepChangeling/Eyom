<p>Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh (/s̼ɪ̘tˈtro/ /vɪ̘ʤ/ [amber] [strip]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ekÿckyewl̄ärtProvence.html">Ekÿckyewl̄ärt Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/Moggugret8r2khdwwsz.html">Moggugret</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh receives an average of 105 cm/y (41 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh covers an area of nearly 166 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8064 m (-16492 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the late 11th century, by Moggugret. The establishment of Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Moggugret electing to pay people to resettle in Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh.</p>
<p>Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Lewldz Vehy Ÿhkphÿh is like a look into a broken heart which long ago fell to corruption. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need… unless of course, they would be an easy target for some robbery. The city has truly fallen to evil.</p>

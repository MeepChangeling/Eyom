<p>Jackridge (/ʤæk/ /rɪʤ/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BeachmapleDutchy.html">Beachmaple Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MonorfordCounty.html">Monorford County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jackridge is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Jackridge was founded by Yó̄y Cú̄̌sh 'Kimber Carmen' Cûf̄ Gāshīsh Mërm Worland, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jackridge has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Jackridge receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Jackridge covers an area of nearly 457 km<sup>2</sup> (182 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1980 m (6496 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jackridge was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1238, by Yó̄y Cú̄̌sh 'Kimber Carmen' Cûf̄ Gāshīsh Mërm Worland. The establishment of Jackridge  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Jackridge's construction back out of the project. Yó̄y Cú̄̌sh 'Kimber Carmen' Cûf̄ Gāshīsh Mërm Worland pushed on reguardles, and Jackridge was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Jackridge was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jackridge is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Jackridge is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad paverstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The riverside city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Jackridge's robustly designed timber walls are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Jackridge seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials.

<p>The name Räz Let Aldrav is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Let Aldrav was founded by <a href="../people/Zlkèbë442095h7bs.html">Zlkèbë</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Räz Let Aldrav has a yearly average temperature of 31°C (87°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 36°C (96°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Let Aldrav was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1140, by Zlkèbë. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Räz Let Aldrav was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Let Aldrav is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Let Aldrav is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Räz Let Aldrav's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Räz Let Aldrav has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Räz Let Aldrav ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Räz Let Aldrav's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves.

The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Räz Let Aldrav's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a great windstorm struck Räz Let Aldrav. Its winds were so great they picked up unsecured objects and flung them with enough force to smash brick and skull alike. Buildings collapsed under the gale, burying countless people alive. The storm's devistation was focused on the area arround Räz Let Aldrav, which lost 150 people, 148, and 89 livestock in the disaster.. History remembers the strom as The Storm of Doom.</p>

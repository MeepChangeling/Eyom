<p>The name Rèvè-co Liyo Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Rèvè-co Liyo Bî was founded by <a href="../people/GadonmtcoSheshèqtêgr90x6s6tu.html">Gadonmtco Sheshèqtê</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rèvè-co Liyo Bî was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1275, by Gadonmtco Sheshèqtê. The establishment of Rèvè-co Liyo Bî was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Gadonmtco Sheshèqtê struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Rèvè-co Liyo Bî as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Rèvè-co Liyo Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rèvè-co Liyo Bî is no diffrent. The village's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Rèvè-co Liyo Bî is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  village is protected by a well-crafted cobblestone fence tall enough to provide adiquite cover for defenders to fire from, but no more than that. The village's frontieer-style defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the village's defences.</p>
<p>Rèvè-co Liyo Bî has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Rèvè-co Liyo Bî’s streets. A look around Rèvè-co Liyo Bî has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Rèvè-co Liyo Bî long.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Rèvè-co Liyo Bî's residents established a new industry (27627 % 6)+1 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Rèvè-co Liyo Bî was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Rèvè-co Liyo Bî. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Rèvè-co Liyo Bî lost 263 people, 331 livestock, and 35 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 43, when members of Rèvè-co Liyo Bî's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular influential figure, and ensure they remain out of enemy hands. The operation was complicated by the enemy setting up an ambush. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the production site, which ended in victory for Rèvè-co Liyo Bî's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Rèvè-co Liyo Bî's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>The name Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Rä̋chYoīkīyGemmaAndreRa̋gNīki̋nḱVúoībōxgj0atp2wd.html">Rä̋ch Yoīkīy 'Gemma Andre' Ra̋g Nīki̋nḱ Vúoībō</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 11th century, by Rä̋ch Yoīkīy 'Gemma Andre' Ra̋g Nīki̋nḱ Vúoībō. The establishment of Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v's construction back out of the project. Rä̋ch Yoīkīy 'Gemma Andre' Ra̋g Nīki̋nḱ Vúoībō pushed on reguardles, and Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged within a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Tshíhzàlùsh Ji̊ Qi̊v is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

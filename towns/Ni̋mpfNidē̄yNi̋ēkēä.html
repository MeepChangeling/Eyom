<p>The name Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/ShîjKthêbTshêjswnaml2rjv.html">Shîj Kthêb Tshêj</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1407, by Shîj Kthêb Tshêj. The establishment of Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Shîj Kthêb Tshêj struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä is is constructed  arround a series of premissive baked earthen mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual though effective defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä’s streets. A look around Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Ni̋mpf Nidē̄y Ni̋ēkēä there is always just enough rain to be annoying.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

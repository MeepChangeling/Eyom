<p>Boke Kshíhgíhd (Kshíh /gɪ̞d/ [memento] [literature; prose]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Hij̼vujProvence.html">Hij̼vuj Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Kshíhgíhd is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Kshíhgíhd was founded by <a href="../people/Hrur3y8mvmry9l.html">Hrur</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Kshíhgíhd has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Boke Kshíhgíhd receives an average of 217 cm/y (85 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Boke Kshíhgíhd covers an area of nearly 127 km<sup>2</sup> (50 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4920 m (16141 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Kshíhgíhd was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1316, by Hrur. The establishment of Boke Kshíhgíhd was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Hrur struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Boke Kshíhgíhd as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Boke Kshíhgíhd was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Kshíhgíhd is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Kshíhgíhd is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt paverstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Boke Kshíhgíhd's millitarily questionable fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Boke Kshíhgíhd has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Boke Kshíhgíhd ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Boke Kshíhgíhd's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Boke Kshíhgíhd.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Boke Kshíhgíhd was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Kshíhgíhd lost 149 people, 252 livestock, and 87 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 62, when members of Boke Kshíhgíhd's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Boke Kshíhgíhd's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Boke Kshíhgíhd's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

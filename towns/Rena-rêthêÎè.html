<p>Rena-rêthê Îè (/ˈrena/ /ˈrɘʃɘ/ [gross] [project]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ore'elolyaProvince.html">Ore'elolya Province</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Rena-rêthê Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Rena-rêthê Îè was founded by <a href="../people/Gilêmgyfnbq8xas.html">Gilêm</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Rena-rêthê Îè has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Rena-rêthê Îè receives an average of 287 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Rena-rêthê Îè covers an area of nearly 276 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1276 m (4186 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rena-rêthê Îè was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1188, by Gilêm. The establishment of Rena-rêthê Îè was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Gilêm electing to pay people to resettle in Rena-rêthê Îè.</p>
<p>Rena-rêthê Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rena-rêthê Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Rena-rêthê Îè is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Rena-rêthê Îè's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Rena-rêthê Îè's budget oriented has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Rena-rêthê Îè gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Rena-rêthê Îè brings to mind.</p>

<p>Rena-rêthê Îè's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Rena-rêthê Îè there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

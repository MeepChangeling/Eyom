<p>Crewell  (/crewell / [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large Town located in <a href="../subprovences/SwynmeadowDutchy.html">Swynmeadow Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/EmadaCounty.html">Emada County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Crewell  is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Crewell  was founded by <a href="../people/ZëiShêthonmthPeck7xyjzulg89.html">Zëi Shêthonmth Peck</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Crewell  has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Crewell  receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Crewell  covers an area of nearly 7 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6028 m (19776 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Crewell  was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1386, by Zëi Shêthonmth Peck. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Zëi Shêthonmth Peck.</p>
<p>Crewell  was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Crewell  is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Crewell  is buildings have been located at convienant points along the mountain Crewell  was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The town's millitarily questionable fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Crewell  hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the town nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the town, particularly the market.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Crewell  has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Crewell . They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Crewell 's parks.</p>
<p>Crewell  has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Crewell .</p>
<p>Crewell  has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Crewell  has a Department of Firefighters, which is responsible for organizing fire fighting efforts during a fire and enforcing local ordinances relating to fire safety.</p>
<p>Crewell  has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Crewell  has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Crewell 's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Crewell  possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large Town. Crewell 's grid is powered by a god's will and kindness.</p>
<p>Crewell 's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Crewell  has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Crewell 's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Crewell  has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Crewell  has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Crewell  has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Crewell 's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In Crewell  most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\HerdAnimalElk(Giant).html">Herd Animal, Elk (Giant)</a> near Crewell  are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Crewell 's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Invocation energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

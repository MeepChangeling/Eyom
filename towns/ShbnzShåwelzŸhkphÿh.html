The  city is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a city of Shbnz Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh's size could have.

<p>Shbnz Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Shbnz Shåwelz Ÿhkphÿh used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 4 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century several years of heavy rains culminated in a peculiar disaster.

<p>Slæ̈rn Zmurl Eplárd-ghrïq was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1296, by Veahn. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Veahn.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Zmurl Eplárd-ghrïq was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Zmurl Eplárd-ghrïq is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Zmurl Eplárd-ghrïq is buildings are arranged within a network of broad split-log ties streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Astonishigly, the exceptionaly well made fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Slæ̈rn Zmurl Eplárd-ghrïq, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud.

The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

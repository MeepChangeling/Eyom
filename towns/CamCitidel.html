<p>Cam Citidel (/kæm/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate City located in <a href="../subprovences/WindbeachDutchy.html">Windbeach Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/SifateKingdom.html">Sifate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Cam Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Cam Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/EveHolidayvibd9pj1mn.html">Eve Holiday</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Cam Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Cam Citidel receives an average of 144 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Cam Citidel covers an area of nearly 36 km<sup>2</sup> (14 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2448 m (8031 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cam Citidel was founded durring the early 10th century, by Eve Holiday. The establishment of Cam Citidel suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Cam Citidel which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Cam Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cam Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Cam Citidel is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Cam Citidel's exceptionaly well made fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Cam Citidel is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Cam Citidel's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is recurring in Cam Citidel.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\ChurchGrim.html">Church Grim</a> near Cam Citidel are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Cam Citidel's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Mysticism energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

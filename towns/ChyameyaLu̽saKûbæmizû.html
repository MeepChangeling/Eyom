<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Lu̽sa Kûbæmizû was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1207, by Dyênhê. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Dyênhê.</p>
<p>Chyameya Lu̽sa Kûbæmizû was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Lu̽sa Kûbæmizû is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Lu̽sa Kûbæmizû is was constructed arround several spacious baked earthen mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive.

This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Chyameya Lu̽sa Kûbæmizû brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Loch Urpad began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which was isolated to the area around Chyameya Lu̽sa Kûbæmizû, which was swallowed by the fumes for several days. Chyameya Lu̽sa Kûbæmizû lost 218 people, 198 livestock, and 29 buildings in the disaster, though it is of note the local plant life flourished after the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Anguish Wind.</p>

<p>Boke Hājlash (/həˑʤ/ /laʃ/ [film] [dairy]) is a subtropical Small City located in the <a href="../provences/VātuchàjùRegion.html">Vātuchàjù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Hājlash is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Hājlash was founded by <a href="../people/SénḱMp̪féchCalvinAmberSé̄̌Cóń̄yYōrmb8w1fsaw8is.html">Sénḱ Mp̪féch 'Calvin Amber' Sé̄̌ Cóń̄y Yōrmb</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Hājlash has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Boke Hājlash receives an average of 257 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Hājlash covers an area of nearly 15 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4350 m (14271 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Hājlash was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1174, by Sénḱ Mp̪féch 'Calvin Amber' Sé̄̌ Cóń̄y Yōrmb. The establishment of Boke Hājlash was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Sénḱ Mp̪féch 'Calvin Amber' Sé̄̌ Cóń̄y Yōrmb struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Boke Hājlash as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Boke Hājlash was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Hājlash is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Hājlash is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow flagstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Boke Hājlash's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Boke Hājlash has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Boke Hājlash ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Boke Hājlash's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>In Boke Hājlash there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Boke Hājlash's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Boke Hājlash used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Boke Hājlash.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Boke Hājlash was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Boke Hājlash. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Hājlash lost 156 people, 310 livestock, and 38 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 217, when members of Boke Hājlash's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the fortification, which ended in a crushing defeat for Boke Hājlash's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Boke Hājlash's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä (/bɔ̄ːk/ /jîːviː/ [sudden; abrupt; swift] [province; territory]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HudajoRegion.html">Hudajo Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/LirulindilChitikinVenomroachs5k9uz1gfxk.html">Lirulindil Chitikin Venomroachs</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 204 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 63 km<sup>2</sup> (25 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3056 m (10026 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1127, by Lirulindil Chitikin Venomroachs. The establishment of Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Lirulindil Chitikin Venomroachs struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Ēthn Yêvy Ni̋ēkēä birds speak prophesy.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

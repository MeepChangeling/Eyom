<p>The name Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/FalassielSedrilCothiel0uy2q5cfhm.html">Falassiel Sedril Cothiel</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1140, by Falassiel Sedril Cothiel. The establishment of Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä is was constructed arround several broad canals mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä’s streets. A look around Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä long.</p>

<p>Maë̋tḩ Ki̋r Ni̋ēkēä's residents established a new industry 2 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Tarn Monoun began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which brought great calamity to the entire nation, killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. The disaster brought an end to  people,  livestock, and  buildings. The disaster is referred to as the Grieving Wind.</p>

<p>Fënê-vëci Sêdè (/ˈfënɘ/ /ˈvëci/ [tight; tense; firm; narrow] [violin]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Z̄upaguvZone.html">Z̄upaguv Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fënê-vëci Sêdè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Fënê-vëci Sêdè was founded by <a href="../people/Trodairk8wtj62l8pu.html">Trodairk</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fënê-vëci Sêdè has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Fënê-vëci Sêdè receives an average of 255 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Fënê-vëci Sêdè covers an area of nearly 142 km<sup>2</sup> (56 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2976 m (9763 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fënê-vëci Sêdè was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1166, by Trodairk. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Trodairk.</p>
<p>Fënê-vëci Sêdè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fënê-vëci Sêdè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Fënê-vëci Sêdè is buildings are located arround a single narrow packed earth mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Fënê-vëci Sêdè's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Unfortuantly, these budget oriented are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Fënê-vëci Sêdè is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

<p>Fënê-vëci Sêdè's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

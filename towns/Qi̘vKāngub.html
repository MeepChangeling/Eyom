<p>Qi̘v Kāngub (/kəˑn/ /gub/ [lid] [local]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/UxblenilCommunity.html">Uxblenil Community</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Kāngub is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Kāngub was founded by Ermp̪f̄sh Yoúnvēs 'Bucket Harley' Mb̪f̄̋sh Ga̋ńnḱ Cú̄̋ńnḱ Jones, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Kāngub has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Qi̘v Kāngub receives an average of 288 cm/y (113 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qi̘v Kāngub covers an area of nearly 274 km<sup>2</sup> (109 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 274 m (898 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Kāngub was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1097, by Ermp̪f̄sh Yoúnvēs 'Bucket Harley' Mb̪f̄̋sh Ga̋ńnḱ Cú̄̋ńnḱ Jones. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Kāngub was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Kāngub is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Kāngub is buildings have been located at convienant points along the cliff Qi̘v Kāngub was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The cliffside city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Kāngub is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Kāngub's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Qi̘v Kāngub the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\MarbleSnake.html">Marble Snake</a> near Qi̘v Kāngub are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Kāngub's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Transmutation energies of tier 1 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Kāngub is accessed from a nearby river via an intricate series of locks.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last (23335 % 6)+1 years has greatly spiked Qi̘v Kāngub's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Qi̘v Kāngub was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qi̘v Kāngub lost 199 people, 358 livestock, and 44 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 160, when members of Qi̘v Kāngub's militia enacted an operation to train a group of civilians for a special clandestine operation. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a crushing defeat for Qi̘v Kāngub's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qi̘v Kāngub's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

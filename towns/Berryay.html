<p>Berryay (/ˈbɛri/ /aɪ/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/FyïftomfDutchy.html">Fyïftomf Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/FenbeckiaEarldom.html">Fenbeckia Earldom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Berryay is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Berryay was founded by Grahr Dillon, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Berryay has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Berryay receives an average of 255 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Berryay covers an area of nearly 260 km<sup>2</sup> (104 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 696 m (2283 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Berryay was founded durring the late 16th century in summer of the year 1551, by Grahr Dillon. The establishment of Berryay suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Berryay which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Berryay was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Berryay is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Berryay is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The valley city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Berryay's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The political statment focused walls have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Berryay has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Berryay ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Berryay possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Berryay has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Berryay has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Berryay. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Berryay's parks.</p>

<p>Berryay possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. In spite of the Galvanic Grid, these lights continue to use their old fule sources to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Berryay has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Berryay has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items. The library is open to the public, including the Aether Link.</p>
<p>Berryay has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Berryay's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Berryay has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Berryay has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Berryay has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Berryay is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Berryay's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Berryay there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿Dvorovoi.html">﻿Dvorovoi</a> near Berryay are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Berryay's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves ritual combat to channel Abjuration energies of tier 1 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Berryay’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Berryay’s streets.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Berryay possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>

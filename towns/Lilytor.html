<p>Lilytor (/ˈlɪli/ /tɔː/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BeachwindDutchy.html">Beachwind Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/BaldockiaMargrave.html">Baldockia Margrave</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lilytor is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lilytor was founded by Èdonm Dowden, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lilytor has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F). Lilytor receives an average of 136 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Lilytor covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5798 m (19022 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lilytor was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1307, by Èdonm Dowden. The establishment of Lilytor  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Lilytor's construction back out of the project. Èdonm Dowden pushed on reguardles, and Lilytor was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Lilytor was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilytor is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Lilytor is is constructed  arround a series of narrow cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The byou city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Lilytor, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Lilytor is centered around a major pilgrimage site. This may be a religious location of importance to a major faith, or it may be a more secular institution that draws the traffic, like a famous academy or the remains of some wondrous ancient work. Considerable local tension likely exists over controlling the access to the site and maximizing the profits from foreign visitors.</p>
<p>Lilytor has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Lilytor was attacked by savage ogress living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lilytor lost 222 people, 324 livestock, and 21 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 222, when members of Lilytor's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about a particular bridge. The operation was complicated by the enemy forces had far more numbers than estimated. The conflict ended with the defense of the bridge against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Lilytor's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lilytor's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà (/ˈobu̹/ /ˈdaqə/ [off white] [apple]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MidimuzunkPrincipality.html">Midimuzunk Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kakoray.html">Kakoray</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà was founded by <a href="../people/Dhighohz8mc4mb0xvm.html">Dhighohz</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -11°C (13°F). Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà receives an average of 282 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the short winter months. Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà covers an area of nearly 121 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4398 m (14429 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1287, by Dhighohz. The establishment of Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Dhighohz struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow flagstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>

The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Chyameya Obu̹ Daqà's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

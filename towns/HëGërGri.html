<p>Hë Gër Gri (/hɛ/ /gɛr/ [whole; entire] [dress; skirt; uniform]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/HöwnowParish.html">Höwnow Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/Gi̽chyhye̜Diocese.html">Gi̽chyhye̜ Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hë Gër Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Hë Gër Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Mlilêjpr69gtmgwh.html">Mlilêj</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hë Gër Gri has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Hë Gër Gri receives an average of 149 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Hë Gër Gri covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4152 m (13622 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hë Gër Gri was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1467, by Mlilêj. The establishment of Hë Gër Gri  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hë Gër Gri's construction back out of the project. Mlilêj pushed on reguardles, and Hë Gër Gri was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hë Gër Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hë Gër Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Hë Gër Gri is buildings are located arround a single broad baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Hë Gër Gri, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Hë Gër Gri, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Hë Gër Gri.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Hë Gër Gri's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Hë Gër Gri most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>

<p>Hë Gër Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Necromancy energies of tier 2 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Hë Gër Gri is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>The <a href="..\items\a tomeofAbjuration.html">the a tome of Abjuration</a>, an a tome imbued with potent amounts of Abjuration energies was created in Hë Gër Gri by <a href="../people/'=.html"></a> in time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century.</p>

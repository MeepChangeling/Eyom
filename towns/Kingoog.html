<p>Kingoog (/kɪŋ/ /oog/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/GreenlandDutchy.html">Greenland Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/SwadiaCounty.html">Swadia County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/NorwickPrincipality.html">Norwick Principality</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kingoog is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kingoog was founded by <a href="../people/Treg̈mWattisps06j3k6l1.html">Treg̈m Wattis</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kingoog has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Kingoog receives an average of 273 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Kingoog covers an area of nearly 270 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1486 m (4875 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kingoog was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1564, by Treg̈m Wattis. The establishment of Kingoog was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Treg̈m Wattis struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Kingoog as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Kingoog was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kingoog is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Kingoog is was constructed arround several restrictive baked earthen mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Kingoog has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kingoog long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kingoog's locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Kingoog's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Kingoog the stars are always right.</p>

<p>Kingoog's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves consuming a local narcotic to channel Illusion energies of tier 1 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Kingoog is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kingoog was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kingoog lost 210 people, 210 livestock, and 46 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 136, when members of Kingoog's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by the enemy setting up an ambush. The conflict ended with the defense of the port against a siege, which ended in defeat for Kingoog's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kingoog's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

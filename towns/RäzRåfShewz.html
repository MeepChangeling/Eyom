<p>The name Räz Råf Shewz is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Råf Shewz was founded by <a href="../people/Khnegmasblfbhmawh3.html">Khnegmas</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Räz Råf Shewz receives an average of 251 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Räz Råf Shewz covers an area of nearly 164 km<sup>2</sup> (65 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1798 m (5898 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Råf Shewz was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1344, by Khnegmas. The establishment of Räz Råf Shewz suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Räz Råf Shewz which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Räz Råf Shewz was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Råf Shewz is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Råf Shewz is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad baked earthen streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Räz Råf Shewz's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Räz Råf Shewz has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Räz Råf Shewz ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Räz Råf Shewz's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is long in Räz Råf Shewz.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

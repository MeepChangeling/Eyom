<p>Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ (/jaz/ /ˈlijə/ [humble; modest; shy] [offer]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/S̺ûzamûUdûCounty.html">S̺ûzamû Udû County</a>, <a href="../provences/WekerisCounty.html">Wekeris County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ was founded by Tsilî, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ receives an average of 276 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 624 m (2047 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1140, by Tsilî. The establishment of Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tsilî struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow split-log ties streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The lakeside city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Unfortuantly, these political statment focused walls are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Bu̹ Liyà Mudâ is like a look into a broken heart. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need. It’s not malicious. Heads are hung. Eyes are empty. Something truly horrible happened here once upon a time and the city never healed.</p>

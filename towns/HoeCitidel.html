<p>Hoe Citidel (/hoʊ/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hoe Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hoe Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/ZlelNettlesxba3xff8yp.html">Zlel Nettles</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hoe Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Hoe Citidel receives an average of 293 cm/y (115 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Hoe Citidel covers an area of nearly 115 km<sup>2</sup> (46 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1020 m (3346 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hoe Citidel was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1387, by Zlel Nettles. The establishment of Hoe Citidel  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hoe Citidel's construction back out of the project. Zlel Nettles pushed on reguardles, and Hoe Citidel was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hoe Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hoe Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Hoe Citidel is buildings have been located at convienant points along the valley Hoe Citidel was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious packed earth streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Hoe Citidel's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Hoe Citidel is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Hoe Citidel's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Hoe Citidel rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 6 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami spared the town from the rampage of a legendary monster. One of Hoe Citidel's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

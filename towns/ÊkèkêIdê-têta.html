<p>The name Êkèkê Idê-têta is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Idê-têta was founded by <a href="../people/Gó̄shīySérmbShyIvorySēkidāHa̋mpf̄Bé̄bh1mkfwwnug.html">Gó̄shīy Sérmb 'Shy Ivory' Sēkidā Ha̋mpf̄ Bé̄b</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Idê-têta was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1242, by Gó̄shīy Sérmb 'Shy Ivory' Sēkidā Ha̋mpf̄ Bé̄b. The establishment of Êkèkê Idê-têta  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Êkèkê Idê-têta's construction back out of the project. Gó̄shīy Sérmb 'Shy Ivory' Sēkidā Ha̋mpf̄ Bé̄b pushed on reguardles, and Êkèkê Idê-têta was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Idê-têta was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Idê-têta is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Idê-têta is is constructed  arround a series of broad cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Êkèkê Idê-têta hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p>Lisbrough (/liːz/ /brough/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/MorhollowDutchy.html">Morhollow Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/FenbeckiaEarldom.html">Fenbeckia Earldom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lisbrough is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lisbrough was founded by Ýal̄ů Dinning, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lisbrough has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Lisbrough receives an average of 232 cm/y (91 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Lisbrough covers an area of nearly 270 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2070 m (6791 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lisbrough was founded durring the early 9th century, by Ýal̄ů Dinning. The establishment of Lisbrough  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Lisbrough's construction back out of the project. Ýal̄ů Dinning pushed on reguardles, and Lisbrough was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Lisbrough was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lisbrough is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lisbrough is buildings are speckled and packed arround broad cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The riverside city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Lisbrough's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Lisbrough is a bustling hive of activity. Everyone moves at nothing short of a jog, each convocation is a mile a minute, and there’s dedicated lanes for riding through town in the center of each street. The locals all appear to be not merely occupied, but in a true hurry for everything from drinking a pint of ale to their daily work.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Lisbrough has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Lisbrough's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Lisbrough has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lisbrough's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>In Lisbrough hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Ramidreju.html">Ramidreju</a> near Lisbrough are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Lisbrough's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 1 via mimery.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Lisbrough's residents established a new industry (32191 % 6)+1 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>

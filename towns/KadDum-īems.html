<p>Kad Dum-īems (/dum/ /jems/ [ugly] [mural]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SluptprondPrincipality.html">Sluptprond Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Koiapi.html">Koiapi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Dum-īems is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Dum-īems was founded by <a href="../people/Urgatalk63ccd3dm.html">Urgata</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Dum-īems has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -13°C (9°F). Kad Dum-īems receives an average of 211 cm/y (83 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kad Dum-īems covers an area of nearly 147 km<sup>2</sup> (58 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6088 m (19973 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Dum-īems was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1189, by Urgata. The establishment of Kad Dum-īems suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Kad Dum-īems was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Dum-īems is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Kad Dum-īems is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt split-log ties streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Kad Dum-īems's cost-cutting-focused defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Kad Dum-īems is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Dum-īems's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Kad Dum-īems there are no smells.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

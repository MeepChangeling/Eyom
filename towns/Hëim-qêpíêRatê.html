<p>The name Hëim-qêpíê Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Hëim-qêpíê Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Gadsílzpmx89ic7.html">Gadsí</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hëim-qêpíê Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Hëim-qêpíê Ratê receives an average of 65 cm/y (25 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Hëim-qêpíê Ratê covers an area of nearly 49 km<sup>2</sup> (19 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5316 m (17440 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hëim-qêpíê Ratê was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1285, by Gadsí. The establishment of Hëim-qêpíê Ratê  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hëim-qêpíê Ratê's construction back out of the project. Gadsí pushed on reguardles, and Hëim-qêpíê Ratê was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hëim-qêpíê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hëim-qêpíê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Hëim-qêpíê Ratê is buildings are arranged arround a single spacious paverstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Astonishigly, the cost-cutting-focused defences are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Hëim-qêpíê Ratê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Hëim-qêpíê Ratê has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.</p>
<p>Hëim-qêpíê Ratê's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Hëim-qêpíê Ratê was attacked by a group of nobles with their private armies. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Hëim-qêpíê Ratê lost 145 people, 101 livestock, and 39 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 190, when members of Hëim-qêpíê Ratê's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the port, which ended in a crushing defeat for Hëim-qêpíê Ratê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Hëim-qêpíê Ratê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

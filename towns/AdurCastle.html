<p>The name Adur Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Adur Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TshêyeshëODellnc2x5ysyr2.html">Tshêyeshë O'Dell</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Adur Castle has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 16°C (60°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Adur Castle receives an average of 235 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Adur Castle covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1202 m (3943 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Adur Castle was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1101, by Tshêyeshë O'Dell. The establishment of Adur Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Adur Castle's construction back out of the project. Tshêyeshë O'Dell pushed on reguardles, and Adur Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Adur Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Adur Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Adur Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive canals streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Adur Castle's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual though effective defenses has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Adur Castle is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Adur Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>In Adur Castle the milk never sours.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Achaierai.html">Achaierai</a> near Adur Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Adur Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves square dance to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 1 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

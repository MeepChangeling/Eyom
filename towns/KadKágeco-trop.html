<p>Kad Kágeco-trop (/sdæ̝dˈnumnulˌni/ /trop/ [boring] [rationale]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SluptprondPrincipality.html">Sluptprond Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Koiapi.html">Koiapi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Kágeco-trop is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Kágeco-trop was founded by <a href="../people/Ubleth2cqi7jp9sf.html">Ubleth</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Kágeco-trop has a yearly average temperature of 3°C (37°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 18°C (64°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -12°C (11°F). Kad Kágeco-trop receives an average of 213 cm/y (83 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kad Kágeco-trop covers an area of nearly 50 km<sup>2</sup> (20 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4836 m (15866 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Kágeco-trop was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1262, by Ubleth. The establishment of Kad Kágeco-trop suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Kad Kágeco-trop which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Kad Kágeco-trop was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Kágeco-trop is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kad Kágeco-trop is is constructed  arround a series of crampt baked earthen mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Kad Kágeco-trop's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Kad Kágeco-trop's unusual though effective defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Kad Kágeco-trop, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all preforming the same rituals to bless and anoint building,s streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holysymbols is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This city certainly loves its god.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Kad Kágeco-trop's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is recurring in Kad Kágeco-trop.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kad Kágeco-trop was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kad Kágeco-trop lost 129 people, 299 livestock, and 79 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 123, when members of Kad Kágeco-trop's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific resource to a particular port unharmed. The operation was complicated by blistering heat, such that many succumbed to heatstroke. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the port, which ended in defeat for Kad Kágeco-trop's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kad Kágeco-trop's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

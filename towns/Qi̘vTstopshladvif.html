<p>The name Qi̘v Tstopshladvif is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Tstopshladvif was founded by <a href="../people/SnerriRhyspcusp0uaz1.html">Snerri Rhys</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Tstopshladvif has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Qi̘v Tstopshladvif receives an average of 181 cm/y (71 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Qi̘v Tstopshladvif covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8656 m (-14550 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Tstopshladvif was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1205, by Snerri Rhys. The establishment of Qi̘v Tstopshladvif was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Snerri Rhys struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qi̘v Tstopshladvif as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Tstopshladvif was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Tstopshladvif is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Tstopshladvif is buildings have been located at convienant points along the valley Qi̘v Tstopshladvif was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow packed earth streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Qi̘v Tstopshladvif, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Tstopshladvif has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Qi̘v Tstopshladvif ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Qi̘v Tstopshladvif was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qi̘v Tstopshladvif lost 159 people, 265 livestock, and 39 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 93, when members of Qi̘v Tstopshladvif's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular irregulars group to a safe location. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the research site, which ended in defeat for Qi̘v Tstopshladvif's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qi̘v Tstopshladvif's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

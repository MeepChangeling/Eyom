<p>Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu (/lə̝s/ /honˈnju/ [sorry; sad] [rope; cord]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CålärufProvence.html">Cåläruf Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu was founded by <a href="../people/Ůtsafbg5105z7s.html">Ůtsa</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu covers an area of nearly 152 km<sup>2</sup> (60 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 17052 m (12995 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1271, by Ůtsa. The establishment of Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu's construction back out of the project. Ůtsa pushed on reguardles, and Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad gravel streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Qÿhtvehb Yähe Honnyu, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

</div>
<p>Innsgarth (/innsgarth/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large Town located in <a href="../subprovences/PinemeadowDutchy.html">Pinemeadow Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/ZiirneaCounty.html">Ziirnea County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Innsgarth is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Innsgarth was founded by <a href="../people/GlèdsmêFreelandzu5jld1nnw.html">Glèdsmê Freeland</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Innsgarth has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Innsgarth receives an average of 234 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Innsgarth covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6006 m (19704 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Innsgarth was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1311, by Glèdsmê Freeland. The establishment of Innsgarth was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Glèdsmê Freeland electing to pay people to resettle in Innsgarth.</p>
<p>Innsgarth was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Innsgarth is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Innsgarth is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Innsgarth's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Innsgarth's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Innsgarth has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Innsgarth ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Innsgarth has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Innsgarth. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Innsgarth's parks.</p>
<p>Innsgarth has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Innsgarth.</p>
<p>Innsgarth has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Innsgarth has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Innsgarth has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Innsgarth's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Innsgarth possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large Town. Innsgarth's grid is powered by mana accumulators.</p>
<p>Innsgarth possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. In spite of the Galvanic Grid, these lights continue to use their old fule sources to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Innsgarth has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Innsgarth has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Innsgarth's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Innsgarth has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Innsgarth has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Innsgarth might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Innsgarth's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by order, symmetry, formal design, grandiosity, and elaborate ornamentation. Architectural characteristics include balustrades, balconies, columns, cornices, pilasters, and triangular pediments. Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. Interiors will often have a grand stairway and opulent ballroom..</p>
<p>In Innsgarth rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Buckawn.html">Buckawn</a> near Innsgarth are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Innsgarth's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Mysticism energies of tier 2 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Innsgarth was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Innsgarth lost 247 people, 223 livestock, and 57 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 45, when members of Innsgarth's militia enacted an operation to rescue a particular solgiers group from the enemy. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a crushing defeat for Innsgarth's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Innsgarth's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

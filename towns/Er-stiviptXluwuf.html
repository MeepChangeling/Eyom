<p>Er-stivipt Xluwuf (/er/ /stiˈvipt/ [common; generic] [mirror]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/EhtephcÿfHold.html">Ehtephcÿf Hold</a>, <a href="../provences/Åx̄gÿhlvoÿhchphehKingdom.html">Åx̄gÿhlvoÿhchpheh Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Undermountain.html">Undermountain</a>.</p>
<p>The name Er-stivipt Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Er-stivipt Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Knaathriz7s869b73db.html">Knaathriz</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Er-stivipt Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Er-stivipt Xluwuf receives an average of 249 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Er-stivipt Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 173 km<sup>2</sup> (69 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1526 m (5006 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Er-stivipt Xluwuf was founded durring the early 10th century, by Knaathriz. The establishment of Er-stivipt Xluwuf suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Er-stivipt Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Er-stivipt Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Er-stivipt Xluwuf is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Er-stivipt Xluwuf weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Er-stivipt Xluwuf's budget focused millitary grade defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Er-stivipt Xluwuf makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Er-stivipt Xluwuf's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Er-stivipt Xluwuf sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<p>Er-stivipt Xluwuf's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Conjuration energies of tier 3 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Er-stivipt Xluwuf is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Er-stivipt Xluwuf was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Er-stivipt Xluwuf. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Er-stivipt Xluwuf lost 141 people, 248 livestock, and 50 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 193, when members of Er-stivipt Xluwuf's militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular enemy prototype. The operation was complicated by the enemy forces had far more numbers than estimated. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Er-stivipt Xluwuf's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Er-stivipt Xluwuf's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët (/kul/ /fjɛz/ [arm; hand; wrist; ankle] [clown]) is a temperate Town located in the <a href="../provences/Gde̜ngwatyodMoot.html">Gde̜ngwatyod Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kul-fyëz Vrët is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Kul-fyëz Vrët was founded by <a href="../people/GryriorthSozrerethlcz4r4v80z.html">Gryriorth Sozrereth</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant -17°C (2°F). Kul-fyëz Vrët receives an average of 304 cm/y (119 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kul-fyëz Vrët covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3918 m (12854 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1217, by Gryriorth Sozrereth. The establishment of Kul-fyëz Vrët was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Gryriorth Sozrereth electing to pay people to resettle in Kul-fyëz Vrët.</p>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kul-fyëz Vrët is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  town is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the town's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Kul-fyëz Vrët's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Kul-fyëz Vrët's top tier civilian fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kul-fyëz Vrët hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The town is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Kul-fyëz Vrët. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Kul-fyëz Vrët's parks.</p>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Kul-fyëz Vrët.</p>

<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Kul-fyëz Vrët's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Kul-fyëz Vrët which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Kul-fyëz Vrët sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LeshyFungus.html">Leshy, Fungus</a> near Kul-fyëz Vrët are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Kul-fyëz Vrët's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Necromancy energies of tier 3 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kul-fyëz Vrët was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kul-fyëz Vrët lost 262 people, 361 livestock, and 53 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 47, when members of Kul-fyëz Vrët's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular special forces group to a safe location. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the fortification, which ended in victory for Kul-fyëz Vrët's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kul-fyëz Vrët's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

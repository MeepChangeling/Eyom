<p>Vîva-qêmi Îè (/ˈvɪva/ /ˈqɘmi/ [academic] [blood]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Dore'eailonCounty.html">Dore'eailon County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vîva-qêmi Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Vîva-qêmi Îè was founded by Ceryl Drimorlas Ielret, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vîva-qêmi Îè has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Vîva-qêmi Îè receives an average of 256 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Vîva-qêmi Îè covers an area of nearly 276 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4386 m (14389 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vîva-qêmi Îè was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1327, by Ceryl Drimorlas Ielret. The establishment of Vîva-qêmi Îè was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Ceryl Drimorlas Ielret electing to pay people to resettle in Vîva-qêmi Îè.</p>
<p>Vîva-qêmi Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vîva-qêmi Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Vîva-qêmi Îè is was constructed arround several premissive flagstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The cliffside city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Vîva-qêmi Îè's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Vîva-qêmi Îè seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Vîva-qêmi Îè which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Vîva-qêmi Îè's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is short in Vîva-qêmi Îè.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Vîva-qêmi Îè's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Vîva-qêmi Îè was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Vîva-qêmi Îè lost 292 people, 283 livestock, and 65 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 36, when members of Vîva-qêmi Îè's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Vîva-qêmi Îè's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Vîva-qêmi Îè's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Vabibl-vêtha Îè (/ˈfèzɪ/ /ˈvɘθa/ [stupid; dumb; silly] [end]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MyuegrothCounty.html">Myuegroth County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vabibl-vêtha Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Vabibl-vêtha Îè was founded by <a href="../people/Fyèlêyêcmdna9x9bc.html">Fyèlêyê</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Vabibl-vêtha Îè covers an area of nearly 397 km<sup>2</sup> (158 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2934 m (9625 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vabibl-vêtha Îè was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1145, by Fyèlêyê. The establishment of Vabibl-vêtha Îè suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Vabibl-vêtha Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vabibl-vêtha Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Vabibl-vêtha Îè is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Vabibl-vêtha Îè's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The top tier civilian fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Vabibl-vêtha Îè has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Vabibl-vêtha Îè long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1214, by Erméoī Dā̌shī 'Bounty Lisso' Ha̋nvōw̄y Mp̪fēb Rërméch Nuldztrÿkle. The establishment of Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt gravel streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town emploies a series of defencive earthworks, spikes, and fences to provide some protection against wild beasts and smaller groups of intelegent foes. Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh's minimaly adiquite are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the town as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves.

The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh lost 241 people, 370 livestock, and 51 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 179, when members of Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh's militia enacted an operation to capture a specific enemy 's family member alive. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ådehlÿ Shusckye Kÿhyåssh's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

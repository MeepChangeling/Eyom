<p>Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ (/ˈledɑ/ /ˈlʊco/ [skinny] [security]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Hu̽sahiMokîKingdom.html">Hu̽sahi Mokî Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/HsenetCounty.html">Hsenet County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/WarreneseShogunate.html">Warrenese Shogunate</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ was founded by <a href="../people/Bíriel6hgrk1pac9.html">Bíriel</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F). Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ receives an average of 269 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ covers an area of nearly 454 km<sup>2</sup> (181 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6316 m (20721 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1226, by Bíriel. The establishment of Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Bíriel struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ's millitarily questionable fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿DinosaurCeratosaurus.html">﻿Dinosaur, Ceratosaurus</a> near Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Ledâ Lûchyo Mudâ's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves performance art to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 2 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

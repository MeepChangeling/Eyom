<p>The name Qokhkì-vikh Mil is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Qokhkì-vikh Mil was founded by Meredith Êyèbëm, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qokhkì-vikh Mil has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Qokhkì-vikh Mil receives an average of 275 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qokhkì-vikh Mil covers an area of nearly 469 km<sup>2</sup> (187 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 998 m (3274 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qokhkì-vikh Mil was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1057, by Meredith Êyèbëm. The establishment of Qokhkì-vikh Mil suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Qokhkì-vikh Mil which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Qokhkì-vikh Mil was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qokhkì-vikh Mil is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qokhkì-vikh Mil is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The cliffside city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Qokhkì-vikh Mil's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Qokhkì-vikh Mil has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Qokhkì-vikh Mil suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Qokhkì-vikh Mil long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Qokhkì-vikh Mil might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Qokhkì-vikh Mil's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Qokhkì-vikh Mil.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ (/ˈmequ̽/ /ˈmɪːkʊ/ [mere] [drain]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NetepBarony.html">Netep Barony</a> of the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ was founded by <a href="../people/Gwaingwenp5j9ms5xx4.html">Gwaingwen</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 20°C (68°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ receives an average of 270 cm/y (106 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ covers an area of nearly 318 km<sup>2</sup> (127 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1268 m (4160 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1192, by Gwaingwen. The establishment of Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ's construction back out of the project. Gwaingwen pushed on reguardles, and Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ is buildings are located arround a single crampt flagstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ's failry decent fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Mequ̽ Mîkû Mudâ has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>

<p>Fêlë-dêshi Îè (/ˈfɘlë/ /ˈdɘʃi/ [bad; evil] [divorce]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ShîrècëvîtêdëCounty.html">Shîrècëvîtêdë County</a>, <a href="../provences/CeliondraCounty.html">Celiondra County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fêlë-dêshi Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Fêlë-dêshi Îè was founded by Arianrhod, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fêlë-dêshi Îè has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Fêlë-dêshi Îè receives an average of 264 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Fêlë-dêshi Îè covers an area of nearly 326 km<sup>2</sup> (130 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5636 m (18490 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fêlë-dêshi Îè was founded durring the early 10th century, by Arianrhod. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Fêlë-dêshi Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fêlë-dêshi Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Fêlë-dêshi Îè is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive packed earth streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The valley city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Fêlë-dêshi Îè's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Fêlë-dêshi Îè's budget oriented are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Fêlë-dêshi Îè has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Fêlë-dêshi Îè long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Fêlë-dêshi Îè has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.</p>

The style used is characterized by order, symmetry, formal design, grandiosity, and elaborate ornamentation.

Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields.

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

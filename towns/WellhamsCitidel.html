<p>Wellhams Citidel (/wellhams/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/GlassbourneDutchy.html">Glassbourne Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/KobianKingdom.html">Kobian Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wellhams Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wellhams Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/TsheshêStephensFowlerPynchonaufi97xh4j.html">Tsheshê Stephens Fowler Pynchon</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Wellhams Citidel covers an area of nearly 8 km<sup>2</sup> (3 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1046 m (3431 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wellhams Citidel was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1269, by Tsheshê Stephens Fowler Pynchon. The establishment of Wellhams Citidel was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Tsheshê Stephens Fowler Pynchon electing to pay people to resettle in Wellhams Citidel.</p>
<p>Wellhams Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wellhams Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wellhams Citidel is buildings folow an organic layout of crampt cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Wellhams Citidel has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Wellhams Citidel’s streets. A look around Wellhams Citidel has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Wellhams Citidel long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Wellhams Citidel's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LeafRay.html">Leaf Ray</a> near Wellhams Citidel are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Wellhams Citidel's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves creating small tokens to channel Invocation energies of tier 2 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir (Rāsv /kir/ [authority] [counsel]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/FtiyāobātRegion.html">Ftiyāobāt Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Odíhg Rāsvkir is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Odíhg Rāsvkir was founded by <a href="../people/Cä̋mbRä̋PumpkinSugarSēnḱErméoīJoīkī̌Làkocàqll4zyyv8p.html">Cä̋mb Rä̋ 'Pumpkin Sugar' Sēnḱ Erméoī Joīkī̌ Làkocà</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Odíhg Rāsvkir receives an average of 279 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Odíhg Rāsvkir covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4114 m (13497 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1056, by Cä̋mb Rä̋ 'Pumpkin Sugar' Sēnḱ Erméoī Joīkī̌ Làkocà. The establishment of Odíhg Rāsvkir was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Cä̋mb Rä̋ 'Pumpkin Sugar' Sēnḱ Erméoī Joīkī̌ Làkocà struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Odíhg Rāsvkir as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Odíhg Rāsvkir is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of narrow flagstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Odíhg Rāsvkir's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The town's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the towns defences.</p>
<p>A look around Odíhg Rāsvkir has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Odíhg Rāsvkir long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Odíhg Rāsvkir. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Odíhg Rāsvkir's parks.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Odíhg Rāsvkir.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Odíhg Rāsvkir's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Odíhg Rāsvkir's grid is powered by a boiler and turbine based power plant.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Odíhg Rāsvkir's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Odíhg Rāsvkir hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Urdefhan.html">Urdefhan</a> near Odíhg Rāsvkir are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Abjuration energies of tier 2 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir produces something unique, a good or service that cannot be had anywhere else in the kingdom. This may be due to some unique resource found only there, or some carefully-guarded craft, or it may be a special service that can only be provided by the locals, who are somehow unique in their forms or abilities.</p>
<p>Odíhg Rāsvkir's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Odíhg Rāsvkir was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Odíhg Rāsvkir lost 142 people, 123 livestock, and 99 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 112, when members of Odíhg Rāsvkir's militia enacted an operation to train a specific solgiers group for an upcoming operation. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Odíhg Rāsvkir's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Odíhg Rāsvkir's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

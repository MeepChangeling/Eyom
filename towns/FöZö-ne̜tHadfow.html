<p>The name Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Mithnyv3iy890hqn.html">Mithny</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow was founded durring the early 9th century, by Mithny. The establishment of Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow is buildings folow an organic layout of spacious gravel streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow lost 293 people, 135 livestock, and 66 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 161, when members of Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy expert. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Fö Zö-ne̜t Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

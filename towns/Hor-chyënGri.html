<p>Hor-chyën Gri (/hor/ /cɛn/ [louse] [cabin; hut; inn; lodge]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/VuquzikotiParish.html">Vuquzikoti Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/VerugepeomaDiocese.html">Verugepeoma Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hor-chyën Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hor-chyën Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Goenesgjdlh5rkgi.html">Goenes</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hor-chyën Gri has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Hor-chyën Gri receives an average of 68 cm/y (26 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Hor-chyën Gri covers an area of nearly 18 km<sup>2</sup> (7 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8354 m (-15541 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hor-chyën Gri was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1181, by Goenes. The establishment of Hor-chyën Gri  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hor-chyën Gri's construction back out of the project. Goenes pushed on reguardles, and Hor-chyën Gri was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hor-chyën Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hor-chyën Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hor-chyën Gri is was constructed arround several restrictive paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Hor-chyën Gri's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Hor-chyën Gri hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Hor-chyën Gri is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Hor-chyën Gri has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>

<p>Hor-chyën Gri has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Hor-chyën Gri's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Hor-chyën Gri has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<p>Hor-chyën Gri has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Hor-chyën Gri which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Hor-chyën Gri's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Gremlin.html">Gremlin</a> near Hor-chyën Gri are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Hor-chyën Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves reenactments to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 2 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

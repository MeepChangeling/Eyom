<p>Waithe Castle (/waithe/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Waithe Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Waithe Castle was founded by <a href="../people/GhebiSpringfordwffu5jlmnd.html">Ghebi Springford</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Waithe Castle has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Waithe Castle receives an average of 294 cm/y (115 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Waithe Castle covers an area of nearly 207 km<sup>2</sup> (82 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1218 m (3996 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Waithe Castle was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1057, by Ghebi Springford. The establishment of Waithe Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Waithe Castle's construction back out of the project. Ghebi Springford pushed on reguardles, and Waithe Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Waithe Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Waithe Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Waithe Castle is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of broad packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Astonishigly, the failry decent fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Waithe Castle has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Waithe Castle suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Waithe Castle long.</p>

<p>Waithe Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Waithe Castle during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Waithe Castle is known for its well built pedestrian paths, which include foot bridges to cross the main street at several high-traffic areas.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 4 years has greatly spiked Waithe Castle's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami solved a major long term problem plaguing the town. One of Waithe Castle's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

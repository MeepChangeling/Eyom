<p>Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ (/ˈqʊca/ /ˈdu̽ni/ [clean; clear] [furniture]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/LakâKâziPrincipality.html">Lakâ Kâzi Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kakoray.html">Kakoray</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Ch́ijdqwcb79z9.html">Ch́i</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 10°C (50°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -4°C (25°F). Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ receives an average of 219 cm/y (86 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 73 km<sup>2</sup> (29 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4750 m (15583 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1461, by Ch́i. The establishment of Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ch́i struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ is buildings have been located at convienant points along the cliff Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious packed earth streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ's failry decent fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ long.</p>

<p>Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ lost 167 people, 275 livestock, and 61 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 99, when members of Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Qûchya Du̽ni Kâchyâ's forces.

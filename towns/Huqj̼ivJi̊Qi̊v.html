<p>Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v (/huq/ /j̼iv/ [suit; costume; garment; uniform] [rough]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HujdàjRegion.html">Hujdàj Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Nayk2f1f5kjaun.html">Nayk</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 76 km<sup>2</sup> (30 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 910 m (2985 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 11th century, by Nayk. The establishment of Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings have been located at convienant points along the pond Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is skipped in Huqj̼iv Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>

<p>Pinepore (/paɪn/ /pɔː/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/StotliaEarldom.html">Stotlia Earldom</a> of the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHobben.html">Kingdom of Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Pinepore is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Pinepore was founded by Goliath Spiders Monk, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Pinepore has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Pinepore receives an average of 276 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Pinepore covers an area of nearly 507 km<sup>2</sup> (202 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2500 m (8202 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Pinepore was founded durring the late 9th century, by Goliath Spiders Monk. The establishment of Pinepore was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Goliath Spiders Monk struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Pinepore as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Pinepore was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Pinepore is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Pinepore is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The riverside city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The would-be-castle fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Pinepore is like looking into a university’s plaza on the day before an exam. People rush about to-and-fro. Discarded scrolls and quills are dotted around  city. In spite of many locals discussing academic topics, there’s little sign of any organized groups for any of that talk. Infact, the city seems disordered in general with everything scattered helter skelter about.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Pinepore possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Pinepore's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is inspired by the natural world, characterized by sinuous, sculptural, organic shapes, arches, curving lines, and sensual ornamentation. Common motifs included stylized versions of leaves, flowers, vines, insects, animals, and other natural elements. Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, curved windows, and decorative trim work. .</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SnakeVenomous.html">Snake, Venomous</a> near Pinepore are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Pinepore's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves sex to channel Mysticism energies of tier 1 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Pinepore is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Pinepore's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>

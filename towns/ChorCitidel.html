<p>Chor Citidel (/ˈʧeɪər/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Seóvmbaw̄äProvence.html">Seóvmbaw̄ä Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chor Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chor Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/RärCa̋chvénḱChanelZoinVú̄sYāb̪véBé̄̄kīyWeldenl307yfb7vu.html">Rär Ca̋chvénḱ 'Chanel Zoin' Vú̄s Yāb̪vé Bé̄̄kīy Welden</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chor Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Chor Citidel receives an average of 274 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Chor Citidel covers an area of nearly 102 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1380 m (4527 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chor Citidel was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1334, by Rär Ca̋chvénḱ 'Chanel Zoin' Vú̄s Yāb̪vé Bé̄̄kīy Welden. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Chor Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chor Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chor Citidel is is constructed  arround a series of crampt cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Chor Citidel's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Chor Citidel's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Chor Citidel is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Chor Citidel's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

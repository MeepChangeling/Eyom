<p>Fallview (/fɔːl/ /vjuː/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/JanbeachDutchy.html">Janbeach Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/SoroughCounty.html">Sorough County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fallview is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fallview was founded by <a href="../people/AlphaenRees434uyd0nrj.html">Alphaen Rees</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fallview has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Fallview receives an average of 143 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Fallview covers an area of nearly 399 km<sup>2</sup> (159 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3468 m (11377 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fallview was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1364, by Alphaen Rees. The establishment of Fallview  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Fallview's construction back out of the project. Alphaen Rees pushed on reguardles, and Fallview was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Fallview was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fallview is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fallview is was constructed arround several crampt packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Fallview, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Fallview is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Fallview. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere. Local law enforcement may know all about them, but lack the strength to confront them and their paid or intimidated henchmen.</p>
<p>Fallview's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is long in Fallview.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\DrakeForest.html">Drake, Forest</a> near Fallview are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Fallview's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves ritual combat to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 3 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

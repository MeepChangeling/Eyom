<p>Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya (/ˈlʊnə/ /ˈceda/ [exempt] [goblin]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/S̺aQolûKingdom.html">S̺a Qolû Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/Lu̽chiViyaEmpire.html">Lu̽chi Viya Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Trêvbdsm3gy3xv.html">Trêv</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 11°C (51°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -4°C (25°F). Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya receives an average of 221 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya covers an area of nearly 54 km<sup>2</sup> (21 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4142 m (13589 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1244, by Trêv. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Trêv.</p>
<p>Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a single restrictive paverstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya rainbows form quite often above the Large City.</p>

<p>Bachyî Chyeda Gûchya's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 3 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

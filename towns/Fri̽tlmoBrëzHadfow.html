<p>The name Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Breshêm38ryicqzyv.html">Breshêm</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow covers an area of nearly 189 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1736 m (5695 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow was founded durring the early 10th century, by Breshêm. The establishment of Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Breshêm struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The would-be-castle fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Fri̽tlmo Brëz Hadfow is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

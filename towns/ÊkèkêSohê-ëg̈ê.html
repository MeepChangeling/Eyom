<p>The name Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê was founded by <a href="../people/Kthèb4pxlsl2j90.html">Kthèb</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1327, by Kthèb. The establishment of Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad packed earth streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê's brittle defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Trollkin.html">Trollkin</a> near Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Mysticism energies of tier 1 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Sohê-ëg̈ê is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land.

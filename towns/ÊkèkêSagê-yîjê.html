<p>The name Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê was founded by <a href="../people/Zegêg̈j51jjp0w64.html">Zegêg̈</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê covers an area of nearly 63 km<sup>2</sup> (25 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3804 m (12480 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê was founded durring the early 11th century, by Zegêg̈. The establishment of Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious paverstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê's Ragnarock-era relics has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<p>There’s more than one leader in Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Êkèkê Sagê-yîjê.</p>

<p>The name O̠ Vdrë Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as O̠ Vdrë Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Holgerhup2it13619.html">Holgerh</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>O̠ Vdrë Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F). O̠ Vdrë Hadfow receives an average of 171 cm/y (67 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. O̠ Vdrë Hadfow covers an area of nearly 196 km<sup>2</sup> (78 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8034 m (-16591 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>O̠ Vdrë Hadfow was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1246, by Holgerh. The establishment of O̠ Vdrë Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Holgerh struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish O̠ Vdrë Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>O̠ Vdrë Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and O̠ Vdrë Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>O̠ Vdrë Hadfow is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The millitarily questionable fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around O̠ Vdrë Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear O̠ Vdrë Hadfow suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in O̠ Vdrë Hadfow long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>O̠ Vdrë Hadfow is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>O̠ Vdrë Hadfow is accessed from a nearby river via an intricate series of locks.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, O̠ Vdrë Hadfow was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is O̠ Vdrë Hadfow lost 267 people, 261 livestock, and 68 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 163, when members of O̠ Vdrë Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to fortify a particular port. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in victory for O̠ Vdrë Hadfow's forces.

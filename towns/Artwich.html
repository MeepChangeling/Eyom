<p>Artwich (/ɑːt/ /wich/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Fersá̋ōwDutchy.html">Fersá̋ōw Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DunleyCounty.html">Dunley County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Artwich is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Artwich was founded by Grèbêd Aylesworth, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Artwich has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 20°C (68°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Artwich receives an average of 218 cm/y (85 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Artwich covers an area of nearly 281 km<sup>2</sup> (112 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 188 m (616 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Artwich was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1483, by Grèbêd Aylesworth. The establishment of Artwich was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Grèbêd Aylesworth struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Artwich as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Artwich was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Artwich is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Artwich is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Artwich was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the broad paverstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The valley city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Artwich, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Artwich. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

<p>Artwich's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Qÿhtvehb Elchå Qad is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qÿhtvehb Elchå Qad was founded by <a href="../people/Húlienurpiq1yub0.html">Húlien</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Elchå Qad was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1533, by Húlien. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Húlien.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Elchå Qad was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qÿhtvehb Elchå Qad is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Elchå Qad is buildings are arranged within a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The city's exceptionaly well made fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Qÿhtvehb Elchå Qad hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<p>Dap Jimtuqíh (/ʤim/ /ˈtuqɪ̞/ [guilt] [awesome]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FelbortonCommunity.html">Felborton Community</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dap Jimtuqíh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Dap Jimtuqíh was founded by <a href="../people/Trg̈mëmëDyfodwgk84rf240wn.html">Trg̈mëmë Dyfodwg</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dap Jimtuqíh has a yearly average temperature of 31°C (87°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 35°C (95°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Dap Jimtuqíh receives an average of 162 cm/y (63 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Dap Jimtuqíh covers an area of nearly 333 km<sup>2</sup> (133 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1210 m (3969 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dap Jimtuqíh was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1351, by Trg̈mëmë Dyfodwg. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Dap Jimtuqíh was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dap Jimtuqíh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Dap Jimtuqíh is is constructed arround a semi-circular broad paverstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Dap Jimtuqíh's Ragnarock-era relics are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Dap Jimtuqíh is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. There’s a patern to the panic. It’s not easy to see, and no one quite agrees on what it is, but the locals know and operate under this pattern. It shapes everything they do, and you feel as if you’ve almost worked it out only for some small detail to devastate your theory every time you try and comprehend it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Dap Jimtuqíh. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere. Local law enforcement may know all about them, but lack the strength to confront them and their paid or intimidated henchmen.</p>
<p>Dap Jimtuqíh's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Dap Jimtuqíh the water is caffeinated.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\MarbleSnake.html">Marble Snake</a> near Dap Jimtuqíh are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Dap Jimtuqíh was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Dap Jimtuqíh lost 120 people, 330 livestock, and 81 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 36, when members of Dap Jimtuqíh's militia enacted an operation to secure a particular port to utilize it for a specific task. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the port, which ended in a stalemate for Dap Jimtuqíh's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Dap Jimtuqíh's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

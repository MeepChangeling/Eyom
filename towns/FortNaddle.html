<p>Fort Naddle (/naddle/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GumadaProvence.html">Gumada Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Naddle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Naddle was founded by <a href="../people/NilJolleymptfkmxk1r.html">Nil Jolley</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Naddle has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Fort Naddle receives an average of 283 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Fort Naddle covers an area of nearly 62 km<sup>2</sup> (24 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4158 m (13641 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Naddle was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1406, by Nil Jolley. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Nil Jolley.</p>
<p>Fort Naddle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Naddle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Fort Naddle is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Fort Naddle's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Fort Naddle's political statment focused walls are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Fort Naddle makes you wonder how anything ever gets done. The locals have clear, obvious rivalries with one another, as seen through clenched teeth and fake smiles. What’s more, there is a serious lack of any organization and planning in Fort Naddle’s layout as well as the local’s behaviors. The city seems to be a den of chaos where tongues are forked and local customs do not exist.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Fort Naddle they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>
<p>Fort Naddle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is skipped in Fort Naddle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Achaierai.html">Achaierai</a> near Fort Naddle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Fort Naddle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Illusion energies of tier 2 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Fort Naddle was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Fort Naddle lost 195 people, 287 livestock, and 23 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 140, when members of Fort Naddle's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by a natural disaster interrupted the operation, shattering unit cohesion. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Fort Naddle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Fort Naddle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

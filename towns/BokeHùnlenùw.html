<p>The name Boke Hùnlenùw is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Hùnlenùw was founded by <a href="../people/JōshīshYātḩlärmJadeZeniRä̌Ya̋chīCú̄shvoīmqaq2f2puy.html">Jōshīsh Yātḩlärm 'Jade Zeni' Rä̌ Ya̋chī Cú̄shvoī</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Hùnlenùw has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Boke Hùnlenùw receives an average of 170 cm/y (66 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Boke Hùnlenùw covers an area of nearly 30 km<sup>2</sup> (12 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1108 m (3635 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Hùnlenùw was founded durring the early 11th century, by Jōshīsh Yātḩlärm 'Jade Zeni' Rä̌ Ya̋chī Cú̄shvoī. The establishment of Boke Hùnlenùw  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Boke Hùnlenùw's construction back out of the project. Jōshīsh Yātḩlärm 'Jade Zeni' Rä̌ Ya̋chī Cú̄shvoī pushed on reguardles, and Boke Hùnlenùw was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Boke Hùnlenùw was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Hùnlenùw is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Hùnlenùw is buildings are speckled and packed arround restrictive cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Boke Hùnlenùw's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Boke Hùnlenùw is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Boke Hùnlenùw might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Boke Hùnlenùw's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Boke Hùnlenùw.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

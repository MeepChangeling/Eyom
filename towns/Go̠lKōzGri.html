<p>Go̠l Kōz Gri (/kli/ /koːz/ [yellow] [turmoil]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/LokvuriuParish.html">Lokvuriu Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/DepiVadiz̄emaDiocese.html">Depi Vadiz̄ema Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Go̠l Kōz Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Go̠l Kōz Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Sraew6h7md3uhu.html">Srae</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Go̠l Kōz Gri has a yearly average temperature of 34°C (93°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 38°C (100°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 30°C (86°F). Go̠l Kōz Gri receives an average of 66 cm/y (25 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Go̠l Kōz Gri covers an area of nearly 235 km<sup>2</sup> (94 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 25788 m (-1293 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Go̠l Kōz Gri was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1416, by Srae. The establishment of Go̠l Kōz Gri suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Go̠l Kōz Gri which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Go̠l Kōz Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Go̠l Kōz Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Go̠l Kōz Gri is buildings are arranged within a network of narrow packed earth streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Go̠l Kōz Gri's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Astonishigly, the boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Go̠l Kōz Gri, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Go̠l Kōz Gri's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Go̠l Kōz Gri rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>

<p>Go̠l Kōz Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Mysticism energies of tier 2 via mimery.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

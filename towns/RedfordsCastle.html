<p>The name Redfords Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Redfords Castle was founded by <a href="../people/SaelhenebWatlingz0qcmzwrqz.html">Saelheneb Watling</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Redfords Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Redfords Castle receives an average of 208 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Redfords Castle covers an area of nearly 16 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4498 m (14757 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Redfords Castle was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1135, by Saelheneb Watling. The establishment of Redfords Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Redfords Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Redfords Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Redfords Castle is was constructed arround several broad worn bedrock mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Redfords Castle's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Redfords Castle shows Redfords Castle as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Redfords Castle places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Redfords Castle. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere. Local law enforcement may know all about them, but lack the strength to confront them and their paid or intimidated henchmen.</p>
<p>Redfords Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Redfords Castle leaves and flower petals never touch the ground.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\MudElementalLarge.html">Mud Elemental, Large</a> near Redfords Castle are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Redfords Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves sex to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 3 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Mayside (/meɪ/ /saɪd/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WestclandCommunity.html">Westcland Community</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mayside is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mayside was founded by Lagotes McCauley, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mayside has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Mayside receives an average of 277 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Mayside covers an area of nearly 482 km<sup>2</sup> (192 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3798 m (12460 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mayside was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1542, by Lagotes McCauley. The establishment of Mayside suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Mayside was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mayside is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Mayside is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt packed earth mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The mountain city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mayside hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Mayside is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Mayside possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>Mayside has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Mayside.

<p>Mayside has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Mayside has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items. While not open to the public, the librarians and scholars employed by the library will assist anyone with their research needs, and wealthy individuals can purchase membership to access the library's materials themselves. In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Mayside has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Mayside's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Mayside has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<p>Mayside is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Mayside's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Mayside hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\DinosaurCompsognathus.html">Dinosaur, Compsognathus</a> near Mayside are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Mayside's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves drinking to channel Charm energies of tier 1 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Mayside's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Mayside is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Mayside was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Mayside lost 168 people, 326 livestock, and 28 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 110, when members of Mayside's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular enemy war machine intact. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with the defense of the research site against a siege, which ended in victory for Mayside's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Mayside's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

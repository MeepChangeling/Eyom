<p>Fyul Vrar Gri (/fjul/ /vrar/ [wet; damp; moist] [sock]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ZapavaduParish.html">Zapavadu Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/JizanutaDiocese.html">Jizanuta Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fyul Vrar Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fyul Vrar Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Tsèsêm2un3b1kbkn.html">Tsèsêm</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fyul Vrar Gri has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Fyul Vrar Gri receives an average of 287 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Fyul Vrar Gri covers an area of nearly 159 km<sup>2</sup> (63 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4976 m (16325 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fyul Vrar Gri was founded durring the late 11th century, by Tsèsêm. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Tsèsêm.</p>
<p>Fyul Vrar Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fyul Vrar Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fyul Vrar Gri is buildings are located arround a single broad gravel mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Fyul Vrar Gri's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Fyul Vrar Gri has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Fyul Vrar Gri’s streets. A look around Fyul Vrar Gri has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Fyul Vrar Gri long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Fyul Vrar Gri which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Fyul Vrar Gri's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>In Fyul Vrar Gri all of the cats speak the local language with prefect diction.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Kijî-cî Ratê (/ˈkiʤɪ/ /cɪ/ [ambiguous] [raincoat]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ineg̈èshoZone.html">Ineg̈èsho Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kijî-cî Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kijî-cî Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Geddeiiypj921mxb.html">Geddei</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kijî-cî Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Kijî-cî Ratê receives an average of 273 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Kijî-cî Ratê covers an area of nearly 175 km<sup>2</sup> (70 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1684 m (5524 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kijî-cî Ratê was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1139, by Geddei. The establishment of Kijî-cî Ratê  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Kijî-cî Ratê's construction back out of the project. Geddei pushed on reguardles, and Kijî-cî Ratê was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Kijî-cî Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kijî-cî Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Kijî-cî Ratê is is constructed  arround a series of crampt paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The millitarily questionable fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Kijî-cî Ratê seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>Kijî-cî Ratê's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program.

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Kijî-cî Ratê used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 5 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Kijî-cî Ratê was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kijî-cî Ratê lost 214 people, 111 livestock, and 68 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 210, when members of Kijî-cî Ratê's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular mine to a safe location. The operation was complicated by gale force winds which drowned out orders and hampered ranged combat. The conflict ended with the defense of the mine against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Kijî-cî Ratê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kijî-cî Ratê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>The name Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Okaz3pn016kvm.html">Oka</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 225 cm/y (88 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1172, by Oka. The establishment of Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v's construction back out of the project. Oka pushed on reguardles, and Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings have been located at convienant points along the cliff Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the broad worn bedrock streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Unfortuantly, these perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v’s streets.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Tstevkas Ji̊ Qi̊v is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

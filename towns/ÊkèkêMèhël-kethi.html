<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi (/ˈëlɘ/ /ˈkeθi/ [awful; terrible] [tailor]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ineg̈èshoZone.html">Ineg̈èsho Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi was founded by <a href="../people/Ca̋nvérCākībTiffanyValentinaGóchVú̄̄̄Coûf̄sht09pml5z0q.html">Ca̋nvér Cākīb 'Tiffany Valentina' Góch Vú̄̄̄ Coûf̄sh</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi receives an average of 242 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi covers an area of nearly 235 km<sup>2</sup> (94 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1596 m (5236 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1338, by Ca̋nvér Cākīb 'Tiffany Valentina' Góch Vú̄̄̄ Coûf̄sh. The establishment of Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi's construction back out of the project. Ca̋nvér Cākīb 'Tiffany Valentina' Góch Vú̄̄̄ Coûf̄sh pushed on reguardles, and Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi is is constructed  arround a series of broad paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Life is hard in Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi. Its people are impoverished compared to their peers elsewhere. Something is making the locals stay, however, whether fear of the alternative, hope for a better future, or a stubborn attachment to their ancestral lands. Whatver the reason, living in this harsh area for generations has made the people of Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi a notably resourceful and hearty people.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\OozeAmber.html">Ooze, Amber</a> near Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Mèhël-kethi's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves ritual combat to channel Transmutation energies of tier 3 via mimery.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

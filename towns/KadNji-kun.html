<p>Kad Nji-kun (/nji/ /kuŋ/ [good; hot (attractive); fine (okay); great (excellent)] [victim; prey]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ÁärvconksPrincipality.html">Áärvconks Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Shayeli.html">Shayeli</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Nji-kun is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Nji-kun was founded by <a href="../people/Kêlëtarjn3pw2z.html">Kêlë</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Nji-kun has a yearly average temperature of 3°C (37°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 15°C (59°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -8°C (18°F). Kad Nji-kun receives an average of 118 cm/y (46 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the long winter months. Kad Nji-kun covers an area of nearly 244 km<sup>2</sup> (97 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2476 m (8123 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Nji-kun was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1430, by Kêlë. The establishment of Kad Nji-kun  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Kad Nji-kun's construction back out of the project. Kêlë pushed on reguardles, and Kad Nji-kun was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Kad Nji-kun was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Nji-kun is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Kad Nji-kun is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of narrow cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Kad Nji-kun, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Kad Nji-kun has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Kad Nji-kun ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Kad Nji-kun as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kad Nji-kun was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kad Nji-kun lost 207 people, 192 livestock, and 24 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 87, when members of Kad Nji-kun's militia enacted an operation to locate a specific  mage. The operation was complicated by thick blankets of fog, which hid friend and foe alike. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Kad Nji-kun's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kad Nji-kun's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>U̽ Gæye Gûchya (/u̽/ /ˈgæje/ [gold] [fraud; hoax]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Àlu̹hoGæchîchyûKingdom.html">Àlu̹ho Gæchîchyû Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/MîKûràEmpire.html">Mî Kûrà Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name U̽ Gæye Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as U̽ Gæye Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Haerombenzwy70ri6jm.html">Haeromben</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>U̽ Gæye Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F). U̽ Gæye Gûchya receives an average of 83 cm/y (32 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. U̽ Gæye Gûchya covers an area of nearly 141 km<sup>2</sup> (56 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3398 m (11148 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>U̽ Gæye Gûchya was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1373, by Haeromben. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>U̽ Gæye Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and U̽ Gæye Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>U̽ Gæye Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow paverstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Astonishigly, the failry decent fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat U̽ Gæye Gûchya hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

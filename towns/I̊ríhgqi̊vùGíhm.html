<p>I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm (/ˈi̘rɪ̞g/ /ˈqi̘vʊ/ [service] [urban]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/VātuchàjùRegion.html">Vātuchàjù Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Shilelêslds863j4i.html">Shilelê</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm was founded durring the late 11th century, by Shilelê. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>I̊ríhgqi̊vù Gíhm makes use of canals for some of its streets. Locals often fish in the canals.</p>

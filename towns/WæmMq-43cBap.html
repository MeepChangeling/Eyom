<p>Wæm Mq-43c Bap (/ɪˈsɨi/ /bap/ [bright] [prey]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/Ot-61esìbDistrict.html">Ot-61esìb District</a> of the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wæm Mq-43c Bap is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Wæm Mq-43c Bap was founded by <a href="../people/MocthGlêbrê0zwrzupqtz.html">Mocth Glêbrê</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wæm Mq-43c Bap has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Wæm Mq-43c Bap receives an average of 222 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Wæm Mq-43c Bap covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4322 m (14179 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wæm Mq-43c Bap was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1319, by Mocth Glêbrê. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Mocth Glêbrê.</p>
<p>Wæm Mq-43c Bap was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wæm Mq-43c Bap is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Wæm Mq-43c Bap is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt flagstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  town posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Wæm Mq-43c Bap weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Wæm Mq-43c Bap's budget focused millitary grade defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Wæm Mq-43c Bap has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Wæm Mq-43c Bap ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Wæm Mq-43c Bap is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the town. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Wæm Mq-43c Bap long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wæm Mq-43c Bap's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Êsê-jëzilê Ratê (/ˈɘsɘ/ /ʤëˈzilɘ/ [orange] [memory]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MèhcebîZone.html">Mèhcebî Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êsê-jëzilê Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Êsê-jëzilê Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Glêli8zrylhwst8.html">Glêli</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êsê-jëzilê Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Êsê-jëzilê Ratê receives an average of 229 cm/y (90 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Êsê-jëzilê Ratê covers an area of nearly 175 km<sup>2</sup> (70 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 9002 m (-13415 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êsê-jëzilê Ratê was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1556, by Glêli. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Glêli.</p>
<p>Êsê-jëzilê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êsê-jëzilê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Êsê-jëzilê Ratê is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive baked earthen streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Êsê-jëzilê Ratê. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Êsê-jëzilê Ratê's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Êsê-jëzilê Ratê grains of dust blow into perfectly neat rows.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Êsê-jëzilê Ratê is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Êsê-jëzilê Ratê was attacked by savage ettins living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Êsê-jëzilê Ratê lost 112 people, 168 livestock, and 23 buildings.

<p>Fort Hoff (/hɔf/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Hoff is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Hoff was founded by <a href="../people/TrteshêvWhitworthclbcguyqh6.html">Trteshêv Whitworth</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Hoff has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 20°C (68°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Fort Hoff receives an average of 250 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Fort Hoff covers an area of nearly 71 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1702 m (5583 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Hoff was founded durring the early 16th century in fall of the year 1501, by Trteshêv Whitworth. The establishment of Fort Hoff suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Fort Hoff which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Fort Hoff was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Hoff is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fort Hoff is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Fort Hoff's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Fort Hoff. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

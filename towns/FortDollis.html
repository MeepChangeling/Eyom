<p>Fort Dollis (/dollis/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/AelwheatDutchy.html">Aelwheat Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/SifateKingdom.html">Sifate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Dollis is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Dollis was founded by <a href="../people/GalenassethBlairTalfourdxfxvfsn8fh.html">Galenasseth Blair Talfourd</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Dollis has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Fort Dollis receives an average of 155 cm/y (61 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Fort Dollis covers an area of nearly 136 km<sup>2</sup> (54 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2708 m (8884 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Dollis was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1178, by Galenasseth Blair Talfourd. The establishment of Fort Dollis  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Fort Dollis's construction back out of the project. Galenasseth Blair Talfourd pushed on reguardles, and Fort Dollis was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Fort Dollis was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Dollis is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fort Dollis is is constructed  arround a series of broad cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Fort Dollis, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Fort Dollis's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fort Dollis hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Fort Dollis. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere. Local law enforcement may know all about them, but lack the strength to confront them and their paid or intimidated henchmen.</p>
<p>Fort Dollis's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Fort Dollis.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Sylph.html">Sylph</a> near Fort Dollis are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Fort Dollis's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Illusion energies of tier 3 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

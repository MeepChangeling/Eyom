<p>Bi-fêfe Bî (/bi/ /ˈfɘfe/ [new] [palace]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/Ineg̈èshoZone.html">Ineg̈èsho Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bi-fêfe Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Bi-fêfe Bî was founded by <a href="../people/PhaeturaDyêbrgfëmkgtpri09it.html">Phaetura Dyêbrgfëm</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Bi-fêfe Bî receives an average of 254 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Bi-fêfe Bî covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2376 m (7795 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî was founded durring the early 11th century, by Phaetura Dyêbrgfëm. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Phaetura Dyêbrgfëm.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bi-fêfe Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Bi-fêfe Bî's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The town's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Bi-fêfe Bî is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble town. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Bi-fêfe Bî. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Bi-fêfe Bî's parks.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Bi-fêfe Bî.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Bi-fêfe Bî's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Bi-fêfe Bî's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Bi-fêfe Bî during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Reigon.html">Reigon</a> near Bi-fêfe Bî are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Necromancy energies of tier 2 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî is known for its well built pedestrian paths, which include foot bridges to cross the main street at several high-traffic areas.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Bi-fêfe Bî is still bloodied by a recent violent conflict. A crushing bandit raid, a lost siege, getting caught at the periphery of a major battle, or some other calamity has inflicted severe damage on the place. Some communities may suffer a longer-term version of this, their youths lost in a grinding, endless battle against some perpetual threat.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> protected Bi-fêfe Bî's harvest from an army of bandits. The recitation of the hero's story remains a popular tavern and fair tale.</p>

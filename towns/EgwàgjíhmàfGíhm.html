<p>The name Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Nadiel̄cqfqmma4lj.html">Nadiel̄</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 31°C (87°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 35°C (95°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 28°C (82°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1123, by Nadiel̄. The establishment of Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm is buildings are located arround a single broad paverstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The city's would-be-castle fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm lost 156 people, 236 livestock, and 97 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 214, when members of Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about a particular production site. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the production site, which ended in victory for Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Egwàgjíhmàf Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

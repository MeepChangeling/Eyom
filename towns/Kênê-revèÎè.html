<p>Kênê-revè Îè (/ˈkɘnɘ/ /ˈrevè/ [light blue] [complex]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/AselumemanCounty.html">Aselumeman County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kênê-revè Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Kênê-revè Îè was founded by Tsêlê, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kênê-revè Îè has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Kênê-revè Îè receives an average of 195 cm/y (76 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Kênê-revè Îè covers an area of nearly 322 km<sup>2</sup> (128 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6858 m (-20449 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kênê-revè Îè was founded durring the late 17th century in early winter of the year 1660, by Tsêlê. The establishment of Kênê-revè Îè suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Kênê-revè Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kênê-revè Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Kênê-revè Îè is buildings are located arround a single restrictive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The hillside city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Astonishigly, the millitarily questionable fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kênê-revè Îè hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Kênê-revè Îè's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Kênê-revè Îè is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>The center of Kênê-revè Îè's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>

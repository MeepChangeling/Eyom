<p>Marron Castle (/ˈmɛrən/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/DellmontDutchy.html">Dellmont Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/FusanKingdom.html">Fusan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Marron Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Marron Castle was founded by <a href="../people/IhzehStoughj2wy3bpz5m.html">Ihzeh Stough</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Marron Castle has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Marron Castle receives an average of 141 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Marron Castle covers an area of nearly 67 km<sup>2</sup> (26 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2376 m (7795 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Marron Castle was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1408, by Ihzeh Stough. The establishment of Marron Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Marron Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Marron Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Marron Castle is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Unfortuantly, these millitarily questionable fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>

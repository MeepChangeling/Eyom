<p>The name Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf was founded by <a href="../people/Lushhd8kwf2x8i.html">Lush</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1299, by Lush. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Lush.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

This may be the seat of a regional lord, or it could be the traditional residence of a high priest, great magus, merchant house, or other wielder of influence.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf lost 102 people, 351 livestock, and 77 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 144, when members of Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf's militia enacted an operation to extract assets from a ruin under siege by the enemy. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with the defense of the ruin against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Slæ̈rn Wäl-jimf's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

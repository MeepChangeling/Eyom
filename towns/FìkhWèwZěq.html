<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq (/wɤw/ /zɛq/ [elusive] [web]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/Glilikthez̄uParish.html">Glilikthez̄u Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/Wv-0săbbDistrict.html">Wv-0săbb District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fìkh Wèw Zěq is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Fìkh Wèw Zěq was founded by <a href="../people/Cb-1lSparksBrgfèjvcmajf3zwi.html">Cb-1l 'Sparks' Brgfèj</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Fìkh Wèw Zěq receives an average of 233 cm/y (91 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Fìkh Wèw Zěq covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4812 m (15787 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq was founded durring the early 11th century, by Cb-1l 'Sparks' Brgfèj. The establishment of Fìkh Wèw Zěq was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Cb-1l 'Sparks' Brgfèj electing to pay people to resettle in Fìkh Wèw Zěq.</p>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fìkh Wèw Zěq is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of narrow cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Fìkh Wèw Zěq's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Unfortuantly, these monster and outlaw focused fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fìkh Wèw Zěq hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Fìkh Wèw Zěq.</p>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq has a government-funded child care program, overseen by the local Department of Nursemaids, which is responsible for providing childcare to working-class citizens according to local ordinances.</p>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>

<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.</p>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The law within Fìkh Wèw Zěq is highly corrupt, or does not apply to certain favored groups or castes. Strangers might be fleeced by local lawmen, evildoers can be absolved by a payment, and powerful gentry do as they please.</p>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Fìkh Wèw Zěq during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SnakeConstrictor.html">Snake, Constrictor</a> near Fìkh Wèw Zěq are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Fìkh Wèw Zěq's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves drinking to channel Summoning energies of tier 3 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Fìkh Wèw Zěq was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Fìkh Wèw Zěq. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Fìkh Wèw Zěq lost 266 people, 220 livestock, and 88 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 112, when members of Fìkh Wèw Zěq's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by gale force winds which drowned out orders and hampered ranged combat. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the port, which ended in victory for Fìkh Wèw Zěq's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Fìkh Wèw Zěq's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

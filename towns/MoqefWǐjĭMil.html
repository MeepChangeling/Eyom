<p>The name Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil was founded by Maegang Glèbrë, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil receives an average of 231 cm/y (90 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil covers an area of nearly 456 km<sup>2</sup> (182 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1484 m (4868 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1134, by Maegang Glèbrë. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Maegang Glèbrë.</p>
<p>Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The riverside city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil's budget focused millitary grade defenses has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Moqef Wǐjĭ Mil long.</p>

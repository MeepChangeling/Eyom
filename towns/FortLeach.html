<p>The name Fort Leach is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Leach was founded by <a href="../people/TrëmënkaRykenerHewsonBroadbridgek7501xy53y.html">Trëmënka Rykener Hewson Broadbridge</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Leach has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F).

Fort Leach covers an area of nearly 43 km<sup>2</sup> (17 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4432 m (14540 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Leach was founded durring the early 17th century in late winter of the year 1602, by Trëmënka Rykener Hewson Broadbridge. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Fort Leach was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Leach is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fort Leach is buildings are located arround a single crampt baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is protected by a well-crafted cobblestone fence tall enough to provide adiquite cover for defenders to fire from, but no more than that. The frontieer-style defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Fort Leach is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Fort Leach used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Fort Leach.</p>

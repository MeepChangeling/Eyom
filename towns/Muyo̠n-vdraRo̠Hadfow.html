<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Muyo̠n-vdra Ro̠ Hadfow was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1307, by Loraine. The establishment of Muyo̠n-vdra Ro̠ Hadfow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Muyo̠n-vdra Ro̠ Hadfow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Muyo̠n-vdra Ro̠ Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Muyo̠n-vdra Ro̠ Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Muyo̠n-vdra Ro̠ Hadfow is buildings are built arround a single crampt flagstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Muyo̠n-vdra Ro̠ Hadfow weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Muyo̠n-vdra Ro̠ Hadfow's budget focused millitary grade defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Muyo̠n-vdra Ro̠ Hadfow hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

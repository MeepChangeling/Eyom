<p>The name Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/GèbêMlêlëGîlsbt9zl4g97.html">Gèbê Mlêlë Gîl</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 37 km<sup>2</sup> (14 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3896 m (12782 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1288, by Gèbê Mlêlë Gîl. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Gèbê Mlêlë Gîl.</p>
<p>Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow packed earth mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Aw̋k Vívr Ni̋ēkēä long.</p>

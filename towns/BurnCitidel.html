<p>Burn Citidel (/bɜrn/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Burn Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Burn Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/CaeriumBorwickhn9nz641up.html">Caerium Borwick</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Burn Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Burn Citidel receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Burn Citidel covers an area of nearly 165 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2314 m (7591 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Burn Citidel was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1247, by Caerium Borwick. The establishment of Burn Citidel suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Burn Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Burn Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Burn Citidel is was constructed arround several crampt paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Unfortuantly, these exceptionaly well made fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Even the most brief look arround Burn Citidel has a good chance of putting a church or shrine into the center of your view. The city is most certainly a god fearing community. It’s also definitely a god loving community. THe streetcornors are occupied by preachers, with the occasional intersection playing host to an actually friendly debate relating to the merits of various gods. Even the less popular as well as the less politically loved gods seem to have a space in Burn Citidel, there’s even shrines to gods known to the region only through hearsay.</p>

<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Burn Citidel.

<p>Burn Citidel's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Burn Citidel every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

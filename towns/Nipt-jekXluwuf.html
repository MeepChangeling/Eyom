<p>Nipt-jek Xluwuf (/nipt/ /jek/ [infinite] [witch]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MïpirudnopluPrincipality.html">Mïpirudnoplu Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tano.html">Tano</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nipt-jek Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Nipt-jek Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Êyêmdaxum3bn23.html">Êyêm</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nipt-jek Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 9°C (48°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 3°C (37°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Nipt-jek Xluwuf receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Nipt-jek Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 216 km<sup>2</sup> (86 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1934 m (6345 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nipt-jek Xluwuf was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1467, by Êyêm. The establishment of Nipt-jek Xluwuf  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Nipt-jek Xluwuf's construction back out of the project. Êyêm pushed on reguardles, and Nipt-jek Xluwuf was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Nipt-jek Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nipt-jek Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Nipt-jek Xluwuf is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Nipt-jek Xluwuf's robustly designed timber walls has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Nipt-jek Xluwuf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Nipt-jek Xluwuf's locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Nipt-jek Xluwuf's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Nipt-jek Xluwuf hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\FleaGiant.html">Flea, Giant</a> near Nipt-jek Xluwuf are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Nipt-jek Xluwuf's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves line dance to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 2 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

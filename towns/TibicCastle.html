<p>Tibic Castle (/tib/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/IzcleaRegion.html">Izclea Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tibic Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tibic Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Ůh́iHeadxgmlrc2n0j.html">Ůh́i Head</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tibic Castle has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Tibic Castle receives an average of 285 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Tibic Castle covers an area of nearly 39 km<sup>2</sup> (15 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4594 m (15072 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tibic Castle was founded durring the late 11th century, by Ůh́i Head. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Tibic Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tibic Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tibic Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits comfortably behind a palisade wall complete with a timber gatehouse and battlments. Tibic Castle's timber-based walls has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Tibic Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Tibic Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Tibic Castle rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SpiderAssassin(Giant).html">Spider, Assassin (Giant)</a> near Tibic Castle are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Tibic Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves bloodletting to channel Summoning energies of tier 2 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

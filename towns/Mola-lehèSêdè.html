<p>The name Mola-lehè Sêdè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mola-lehè Sêdè was founded by <a href="../people/Shtignengg4m9lyldq9.html">Shtigneng</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mola-lehè Sêdè has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Mola-lehè Sêdè receives an average of 204 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Mola-lehè Sêdè covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5010 m (16437 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mola-lehè Sêdè was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1088, by Shtigneng. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Mola-lehè Sêdè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mola-lehè Sêdè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Mola-lehè Sêdè is was constructed arround several premissive cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The millitarily questionable fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mola-lehè Sêdè hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Mola-lehè Sêdè was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Mola-lehè Sêdè lost 153 people, 166 livestock, and 90 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 214, when members of Mola-lehè Sêdè's militia enacted an operation to recruit a particular solgiers group. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Mola-lehè Sêdè's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Mola-lehè Sêdè's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Mola-lehè Sêdè's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

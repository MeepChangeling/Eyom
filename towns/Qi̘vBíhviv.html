<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv (/bɪ̞/ /viv/ [need] [dark]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Wi̊sbèjùCounty.html">Wi̊sbèjù County</a>, <a href="../provences/SeasalShire.html">Seasal Shire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Bíhviv is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Bíhviv was founded by Tshi Llywell, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Qi̘v Bíhviv receives an average of 135 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qi̘v Bíhviv covers an area of nearly 330 km<sup>2</sup> (132 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3066 m (10059 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1160, by Tshi Llywell. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Tshi Llywell.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Bíhviv is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Qi̘v Bíhviv's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Qi̘v Bíhviv makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It’s a quiet city filled with closed scriptoriums, people quietly yet dejectedly reading in isolated places around town, and the occasional book laying in a heap of garbage.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items. While not open to the public, the librarians and scholars employed by the library will assist anyone with their research needs, and wealthy individuals can purchase membership to access the library's materials themselves.

<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Qi̘v Bíhviv might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Qi̘v Bíhviv.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Yothga.html">Yothga</a> near Qi̘v Bíhviv are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Bíhviv's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves drinking to channel Transmutation energies of tier 3 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

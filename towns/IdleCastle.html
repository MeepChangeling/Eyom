<p>The name Idle Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Idle Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TresíCockerellcscp9xfpuy.html">Tresí Cockerell</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Idle Castle has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Idle Castle receives an average of 256 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Idle Castle covers an area of nearly 149 km<sup>2</sup> (59 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2578 m (8458 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Idle Castle was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1455, by Tresí Cockerell. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Tresí Cockerell.</p>
<p>Idle Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Idle Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Idle Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow baked earthen streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Looking around Idle Castle you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Idle Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is long in Idle Castle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Chaneque.html">Chaneque</a> near Idle Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Idle Castle was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Idle Castle lost 176 people, 299 livestock, and 40 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 209, when members of Idle Castle's militia enacted an operation to secure a particular temple to utilize it for a specific task. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Idle Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Idle Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

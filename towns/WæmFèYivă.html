<p>The name Wæm Fè Yivă is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Wæm Fè Yivă was founded by <a href="../people/BrepíFyèlêyêZesheshegajcjxbisy2j.html">Brepí Fyèlêyê Zesheshega</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wæm Fè Yivă has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wæm Fè Yivă was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1388, by Brepí Fyèlêyê Zesheshega. The establishment of Wæm Fè Yivă  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Wæm Fè Yivă's construction back out of the project. Brepí Fyèlêyê Zesheshega pushed on reguardles, and Wæm Fè Yivă was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Wæm Fè Yivă was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wæm Fè Yivă is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wæm Fè Yivă is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  town has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Wæm Fè Yivă's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Astonishigly, the monster and outlaw focused fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Wæm Fè Yivă hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Wæm Fè Yivă is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Wæm Fè Yivă has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>
<p>Wæm Fè Yivă is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with wealth for a year and a day. One of Wæm Fè Yivă's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

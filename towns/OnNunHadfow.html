<p>On Nun Hadfow (/on/ /nun/ [green; raw] [job]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ËkkuvMoot.html">Ëkkuv Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name On Nun Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as On Nun Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Cherysr3rlwgzxtq.html">Cherys</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>On Nun Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -13°C (9°F). On Nun Hadfow receives an average of 213 cm/y (83 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. On Nun Hadfow covers an area of nearly 132 km<sup>2</sup> (52 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5814 m (19074 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>On Nun Hadfow was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1108, by Cherys. The establishment of On Nun Hadfow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of On Nun Hadfow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>On Nun Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and On Nun Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>On Nun Hadfow is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow split-log ties streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. On Nun Hadfow's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around On Nun Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in On Nun Hadfow long.</p>

<p>On Nun Hadfow's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>

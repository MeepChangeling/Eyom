<p>The name Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Tizsaeluzpb5n0lh1.html">Tizsael</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1506, by Tizsael. The establishment of Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Tizsael electing to pay people to resettle in Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf.</p>
<p>Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf is buildings are built arround a single broad baked earthen mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Vávotä-mokizt Xluwuf was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>

<p>Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ (/ˈkoco/ /ˈkudʊ/ [corrupt] [tailor]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/KûrûhaHûmæKingdom.html">Kûrûha Hûmæ Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/Vu̹chiBu̽suEmpire.html">Vu̹chi Bu̽su Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Zlkèdo9cafmn69iy.html">Zlkèdo</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ receives an average of 302 cm/y (118 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 233 km<sup>2</sup> (93 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1612 m (5288 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1132, by Zlkèdo. The establishment of Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Zlkèdo electing to pay people to resettle in Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ.</p>
<p>Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive gravel mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ’s streets. A look around Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Vâme Kudû Kâchyâ long.</p>

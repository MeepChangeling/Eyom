<p>Tilctew Castle (/ˈsæmənz/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tilctew Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tilctew Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ZlêyëmSpencer-Smithiqtq58hatt.html">Zlêyëm Spencer-Smith</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tilctew Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Tilctew Castle receives an average of 259 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Tilctew Castle covers an area of nearly 39 km<sup>2</sup> (15 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2466 m (8090 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tilctew Castle was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1231, by Zlêyëm Spencer-Smith. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Tilctew Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tilctew Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Tilctew Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Tilctew Castle's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Tilctew Castle's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Tilctew Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Tilctew Castle hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with. This hate may spring from recent events, or it may be an inherited spite from old wrongs.</p>
<p>Tilctew Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Tilctew Castle.</p>

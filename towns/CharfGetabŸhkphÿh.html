<p>The name Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/VûftāyRéōLilyRavenDä̌shīRāshī̌Gä̂49lkzw0utz.html">Vûftāy Réō 'Lily Raven' Dä̌shī Rāshī̌ Gä̂</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1325, by Vûftāy Réō 'Lily Raven' Dä̌shī Rāshī̌ Gä̂. The establishment of Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are speckled and packed arround crampt gravel streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Charf Getab Ÿhkphÿh.</p>

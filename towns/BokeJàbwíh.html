<p>Boke Jàbwíh (/ʤəb/ /wɪ̞/ [crater; cavity] [pretty]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WeeaRegion.html">Weea Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Jàbwíh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Jàbwíh was founded by <a href="../people/Alexandradq9lygb5f2.html">Alexandra</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Jàbwíh has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Boke Jàbwíh receives an average of 201 cm/y (79 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Boke Jàbwíh covers an area of nearly 204 km<sup>2</sup> (81 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2828 m (9278 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Jàbwíh was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1187, by Alexandra. The establishment of Boke Jàbwíh  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Boke Jàbwíh's construction back out of the project. Alexandra pushed on reguardles, and Boke Jàbwíh was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Boke Jàbwíh was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Jàbwíh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Boke Jàbwíh is buildings are speckled and packed arround restrictive baked earthen streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Boke Jàbwíh weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Boke Jàbwíh has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Boke Jàbwíh ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Boke Jàbwíh's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Boke Jàbwíh every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

<p>Boke Jàbwíh's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Enchantment energies of tier 3 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Boke Jàbwíh is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> protected Boke Jàbwíh's harvest from an army of bandits.  was immortalized in song for this deed.</p>

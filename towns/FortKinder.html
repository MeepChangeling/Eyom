<p>Fort Kinder (/ˈkaɪndər/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/QuiegsanRegion.html">Quiegsan Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Kinder is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Kinder was founded by <a href="../people/TrëmënkaRykeners2h5naxvg1.html">Trëmënka Rykener</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Kinder has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Fort Kinder receives an average of 163 cm/y (64 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Fort Kinder covers an area of nearly 22 km<sup>2</sup> (8 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4094 m (13431 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Kinder was founded durring the late 18th century in early winter of the year 1685, by Trëmënka Rykener. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Trëmënka Rykener.</p>
<p>Fort Kinder was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Kinder is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fort Kinder is is constructed  arround a series of narrow baked earthen mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Unfortuantly, these would-be-castle fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fort Kinder hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fort Kinder's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Fort Kinder.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SnakeVenomous.html">Snake, Venomous</a> near Fort Kinder are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Fort Kinder's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves creating small tokens to channel Illusion energies of tier 3 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Fort Kinder is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Fort Kinder possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami spared the town from an attack. One of Fort Kinder's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

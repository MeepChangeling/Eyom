<p>Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä (/ɱɔ̌ː/ /gîːʊiː˥/ [tall] [author; writer]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Doûvnḱínts̄rRegion.html">Doûvnḱínts̄r Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/HèbelTsêmMog̈iqhfw3u8a12.html">Hèbel Tsêm Mog̈i</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 274 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 83 km<sup>2</sup> (33 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2570 m (8431 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1310, by Hèbel Tsêm Mog̈i. The establishment of Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Hèbel Tsêm Mog̈i struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad packed earth streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

The conflict ended after roughly 113, when members of Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific prototype to a particular prison unharmed. The operation was complicated by extremely dangerous terrain, including unfamiliar and poisonous plants which many ate while foraging. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Mŏr Gêōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

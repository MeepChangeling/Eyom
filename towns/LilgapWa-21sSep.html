<p>The name Lilgap Wa-21s Sep is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lilgap Wa-21s Sep was founded by <a href="../people/Trêvbuifsas2t7.html">Trêv</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lilgap Wa-21s Sep was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1279, by Trêv. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Lilgap Wa-21s Sep was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilgap Wa-21s Sep is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Lilgap Wa-21s Sep is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive baked earthen mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Lilgap Wa-21s Sep's brittle defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Lilgap Wa-21s Sep has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Lilgap Wa-21s Sep ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Lilgap Wa-21s Sep is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lilgap Wa-21s Sep long.</p>

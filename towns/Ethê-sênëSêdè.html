<p>Ethê-sênë Sêdè (/ˈeʃɘ/ /ˈsɘnë/ [handsome] [stereotype]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GlirukmesaZone.html">Glirukmesa Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ethê-sênë Sêdè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ethê-sênë Sêdè was founded by <a href="../people/Ktîvd7wc930lzp.html">Ktîv</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ethê-sênë Sêdè has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Ethê-sênë Sêdè receives an average of 208 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Ethê-sênë Sêdè covers an area of nearly 76 km<sup>2</sup> (30 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 13102 m (35 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ethê-sênë Sêdè was founded durring the early 11th century, by Ktîv. The establishment of Ethê-sênë Sêdè  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ethê-sênë Sêdè's construction back out of the project. Ktîv pushed on reguardles, and Ethê-sênë Sêdè was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ethê-sênë Sêdè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ethê-sênë Sêdè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ethê-sênë Sêdè is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad split-log ties streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Ethê-sênë Sêdè's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ethê-sênë Sêdè hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<p>Ethê-sênë Sêdè's locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Ethê-sênë Sêdè's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Ethê-sênë Sêdè grains of dust blow into perfectly neat rows.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

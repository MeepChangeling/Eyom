<p>The name Lëîj-cakè Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lëîj-cakè Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Grèsënhx8h6nvrr.html">Grèsë</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lëîj-cakè Ratê was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1324, by Grèsë. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Lëîj-cakè Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lëîj-cakè Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Lëîj-cakè Ratê is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Lëîj-cakè Ratê's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Unfortuantly, these monster and outlaw focused fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Lëîj-cakè Ratê has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Lëîj-cakè Ratê’s streets.</p>

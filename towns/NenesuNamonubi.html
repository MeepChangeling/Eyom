<p>Nenesu Namonubi (/ˈnamo/ /ˈnubi/ [sword; blade] [relevant]) is a temperate Large Town located in the <a href="../nations/expanse.html">expanse</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nenesu Namonubi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nenesu Namonubi was founded by <a href="../people/QheingHoůh́atshuUserkhaure-Setepenrekun7jj9h6y.html">Qheing Hoůh́ats hu Userkhaure-Setepenre</a>, who was culturaly Ancient.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nenesu Namonubi has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Nenesu Namonubi receives an average of 255 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Nenesu Namonubi covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 0 m (0 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nenesu Namonubi was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1214, by Qheing Hoůh́ats hu Userkhaure-Setepenre. The establishment of Nenesu Namonubi suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Nenesu Namonubi which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Nenesu Namonubi was built using the conventions of Ancient durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nenesu Namonubi is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Nenesu Namonubi is buildings are arranged within a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Nenesu Namonubi's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The town's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Nenesu Namonubi has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Nenesu Namonubi ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Nenesu Namonubi is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the town. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Nenesu Namonubi long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Nenesu Namonubi is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Nenesu Namonubi is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>

<p>Zě Răm Kemzǐ (/rə̝m/ /ˈkemzɪ/ [green; sick; fresh] [pressure]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Oj-98sjĭukyiZone.html">Oj-98sjĭukyi Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/Uf-52riaProvince.html">Uf-52ria Province</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Zě Răm Kemzǐ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Zě Răm Kemzǐ was founded by Zlesënho Trgê, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zě Răm Kemzǐ has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Zě Răm Kemzǐ receives an average of 223 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Zě Răm Kemzǐ covers an area of nearly 325 km<sup>2</sup> (130 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1100 m (3608 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zě Răm Kemzǐ was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1143, by Zlesënho Trgê. The establishment of Zě Răm Kemzǐ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Zě Răm Kemzǐ's construction back out of the project. Zlesënho Trgê pushed on reguardles, and Zě Răm Kemzǐ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Zě Răm Kemzǐ was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zě Răm Kemzǐ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Zě Răm Kemzǐ is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The lakeside city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Zě Răm Kemzǐ has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Zě Răm Kemzǐ long.</p>

<p>A substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign settlement conquered within the relatively recent past.

<p>Zě Răm Kemzǐ's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

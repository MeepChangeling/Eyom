<p>Kad Vïtá-máfhi (/xlams/ /mə˞fˈhi/ [counter (flat; elevated surface)] [veil]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ZäntnräwPrincipality.html">Zäntnräw Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Konei.html">Konei</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Vïtá-máfhi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Vïtá-máfhi was founded by <a href="../people/Hylgith3pxrw4m1rr.html">Hylgith</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Vïtá-máfhi has a yearly average temperature of 0°C (32°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 9°C (48°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -9°C (16°F). Kad Vïtá-máfhi receives an average of 201 cm/y (79 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kad Vïtá-máfhi covers an area of nearly 188 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2456 m (8057 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Vïtá-máfhi was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1542, by Hylgith. The establishment of Kad Vïtá-máfhi  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Kad Vïtá-máfhi's construction back out of the project. Hylgith pushed on reguardles, and Kad Vïtá-máfhi was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Kad Vïtá-máfhi was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Vïtá-máfhi is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Kad Vïtá-máfhi is buildings are arranged within a network of premissive packed earth streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Unfortuantly, these perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kad Vïtá-máfhi hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<p>Kad Vïtá-máfhi's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Kad Vïtá-máfhi is uncommonly rich, not only for the gentry but for the common citizens as well. They may produce a valuable good, oversee precious resource extraction, have special economic favors from the ruler, or simply have inherited a vast body of infrastructure. Their neighbors likely view them with envy, and outside raiders and exploiters find them an ideal target.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Kad Vïtá-máfhi is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

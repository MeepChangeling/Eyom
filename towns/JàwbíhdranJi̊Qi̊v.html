<p>The name Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Byoctîjux5pb0bc0z.html">Byoctîj</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1187, by Byoctîj. The establishment of Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Byoctîj electing to pay people to resettle in Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>
<p>Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are built arround a single restrictive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It’s a quiet city filled with closed scriptoriums, people quietly yet dejectedly reading in isolated places around town, and the occasional book laying in a heap of garbage.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Life is hard in Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v. Its people are impoverished compared to their peers elsewhere. Something is making the locals stay, however, whether fear of the alternative, hope for a better future, or a stubborn attachment to their ancestral lands. Whatver the reason, living in this harsh area for generations has made the people of Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v a notably resourceful and hearty people.</p>
<p>Jàwbíhdran Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>

<p>Díhsgùdrù Gíhm (/dɪ̞s/ /ˈgʊdrʊ/ [stereotype] [chance; odds]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Eyj̼íhrriqRegion.html">Eyj̼íhrriq Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Díhsgùdrù Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Díhsgùdrù Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Sé̄shīVúrmbó̄TashaHeavenHaw̄bErmēshCú̄shīnḱ4u2lv72hqv.html">Sé̄shī Vúrmbó̄ 'Tasha Heaven' Haw̄b Ermēsh Cú̄shīnḱ</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Díhsgùdrù Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Díhsgùdrù Gíhm receives an average of 161 cm/y (63 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Díhsgùdrù Gíhm covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4494 m (14744 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Díhsgùdrù Gíhm was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1474, by Sé̄shī Vúrmbó̄ 'Tasha Heaven' Haw̄b Ermēsh Cú̄shīnḱ. The establishment of Díhsgùdrù Gíhm suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Díhsgùdrù Gíhm which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Díhsgùdrù Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Díhsgùdrù Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Díhsgùdrù Gíhm is was constructed arround several narrow flagstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Díhsgùdrù Gíhm's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Díhsgùdrù Gíhm makes you wonder how anything ever gets done. The locals have clear, obvious rivalries with one another, as seen through clenched teeth and fake smiles. What’s more, there is a serious lack of any organization and planning in Díhsgùdrù Gíhm’s layout as well as the local’s behaviors. The city seems to be a den of chaos where tongues are forked and local customs do not exist.</p>

<p>Díhsgùdrù Gíhm's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Díhsgùdrù Gíhm hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Díhsgùdrù Gíhm has a conflict with a neighboring community. This usually isn't part of a larger war, but is instead a personal animosity between them. It may be the community has suffered at their enemy's hands, or they may have been the ones applying the suffering. Constant low-level skirmishes and trouble making go on between the two.</p>
<p>Díhsgùdrù Gíhm's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Díhsgùdrù Gíhm suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

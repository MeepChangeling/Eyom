<p>Hutso-apt Xluwuf (/hutˈso/ /apt/ [nice] [voice]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/FididiäīurgPrincipality.html">Fididiäīurg Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Olatkana.html">Olatkana</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hutso-apt Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hutso-apt Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Hèshëcxz3nb116p.html">Hèshë</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hutso-apt Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of -3°C (27°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -32°C (-25°F). Hutso-apt Xluwuf receives an average of 173 cm/y (68 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Hutso-apt Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 39 km<sup>2</sup> (15 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3934 m (12906 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hutso-apt Xluwuf was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1334, by Hèshë. The establishment of Hutso-apt Xluwuf suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Hutso-apt Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hutso-apt Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Hutso-apt Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a single restrictive paverstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Hutso-apt Xluwuf's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Hutso-apt Xluwuf's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Hutso-apt Xluwuf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

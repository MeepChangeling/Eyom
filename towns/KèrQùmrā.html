<p>Kèr  Qùmrā (/qʊm/ /rəˑ/ [loaf; cake] [violet]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/AltodålphRegion.html">Altodålph Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/TetburCommune.html">Tetbur Commune</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kèr  Qùmrā is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Kèr  Qùmrā was founded by <a href="../people/ZhuihnNanneit4qykbt7h.html">Zhuihn Nanne</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Kèr  Qùmrā receives an average of 245 cm/y (96 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Kèr  Qùmrā covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6556 m (-21440 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā was founded durring the late 17th century in late fall of the year 1575, by Zhuihn Nanne. The establishment of Kèr  Qùmrā  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Kèr  Qùmrā's construction back out of the project. Zhuihn Nanne pushed on reguardles, and Kèr  Qùmrā was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kèr  Qùmrā is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Kèr  Qùmrā was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the town is well defended against anything short of an army. Kèr  Qùmrā's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the town as needed.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Kèr  Qùmrā is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble town. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Kèr  Qùmrā.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Kèr  Qùmrā's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā has an Administrative Academy which trains individuals in the administrative arts.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Kèr  Qùmrā every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SlitheringPit.html">Slithering Pit</a> near Kèr  Qùmrā are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves drinking to channel Augury energies of tier 3 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā produces something unique, a good or service that cannot be had anywhere else in the kingdom. This may be due to some unique resource found only there, or some carefully-guarded craft, or it may be a special service that can only be provided by the locals, who are somehow unique in their forms or abilities.</p>
<p>Kèr  Qùmrā's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Kèr  Qùmrā suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kèr  Qùmrā was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kèr  Qùmrā lost 290 people, 368 livestock, and 70 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 47, when members of Kèr  Qùmrā's militia enacted an operation to break a siege of a particular ruin. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Kèr  Qùmrā's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kèr  Qùmrā's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

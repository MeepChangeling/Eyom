<p>Flíhvíhj Gíhm (Flíh /vɪ̞j/ [worker; employee] [crisis]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MàvēvāvRegion.html">Màvēvāv Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Flíhvíhj Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Flíhvíhj Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Hath́iebimtpmr2kn.html">Hath́ie</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Flíhvíhj Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 30°C (86°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Flíhvíhj Gíhm receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Flíhvíhj Gíhm covers an area of nearly 94 km<sup>2</sup> (37 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3398 m (11148 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Flíhvíhj Gíhm was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1397, by Hath́ie. The establishment of Flíhvíhj Gíhm was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Hath́ie electing to pay people to resettle in Flíhvíhj Gíhm.</p>
<p>Flíhvíhj Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Flíhvíhj Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Flíhvíhj Gíhm is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Flíhvíhj Gíhm weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Flíhvíhj Gíhm's budget focused millitary grade defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Flíhvíhj Gíhm has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Flíhvíhj Gíhm long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Flíhvíhj Gíhm is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Flíhvíhj Gíhm is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>

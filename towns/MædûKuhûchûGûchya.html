<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya was founded durring the early 19th century in early summer of the year 1834, by Thugrer. The establishment of Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 19th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya's Ragnarock-era relics has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Mædû Kuhûchû Gûchya suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<p>The name Gêlëom-bënê Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Gêlëom-bënê Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Êpîtêpíyjcpy7svz0.html">Êpîtêpí</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Gêlëom-bënê Ratê covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1196 m (3923 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gêlëom-bënê Ratê was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1266, by Êpîtêpí. The establishment of Gêlëom-bënê Ratê was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Êpîtêpí electing to pay people to resettle in Gêlëom-bënê Ratê.</p>
<p>Gêlëom-bënê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gêlëom-bënê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gêlëom-bënê Ratê is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Gêlëom-bënê Ratê, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Gêlëom-bënê Ratê has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Gêlëom-bënê Ratê ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Gêlëom-bënê Ratê is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Gêlëom-bënê Ratê was like during the glorydays.</p>

<p>Gêlëom-bënê Ratê's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

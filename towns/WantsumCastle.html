<p>Wantsum Castle (/wantsum/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BāwkyoīäProvence.html">Bāwkyoīä Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wantsum Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wantsum Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Mog̈iWorrellmypycnkp8t.html">Mog̈i Worrell</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wantsum Castle has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Wantsum Castle receives an average of 267 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Wantsum Castle covers an area of nearly 135 km<sup>2</sup> (54 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3594 m (11791 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wantsum Castle was founded durring the late 11th century, by Mog̈i Worrell. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Mog̈i Worrell.</p>
<p>Wantsum Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wantsum Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Wantsum Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Wantsum Castle weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Wantsum Castle makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power.</p>

Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>

<p>Leck Castle (/lɛk/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/ShadowfallDutchy.html">Shadowfall Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/QueoulniaKingdom.html">Queoulnia Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Leck Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Leck Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TrtèdoMcCannk5jt4cc84d.html">Trtèdo McCann</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Leck Castle has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 5°C (41°F). Leck Castle receives an average of 260 cm/y (102 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Leck Castle covers an area of nearly 17 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2356 m (7729 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Leck Castle was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1181, by Trtèdo McCann. The establishment of Leck Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Trtèdo McCann struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Leck Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Leck Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Leck Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Leck Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive baked earthen streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Leck Castle's millitarily questionable fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Leck Castle has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Leck Castle ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Leck Castle is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Leck Castle long.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

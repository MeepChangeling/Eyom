<p>Oldcombe (/əʊld/ /kuːm/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/DragondellDutchy.html">Dragondell Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/HertfordBarony.html">Hertford Barony</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Oldcombe is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Oldcombe was founded by Bë̋ Yaw̋nḱ 'Daze Eloise' Haw̋chī Gā̄nḱ Bé̄s Way, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Oldcombe has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Oldcombe receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Oldcombe covers an area of nearly 275 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4526 m (14849 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Oldcombe was founded durring the early 11th century, by Bë̋ Yaw̋nḱ 'Daze Eloise' Haw̋chī Gā̄nḱ Bé̄s Way. The establishment of Oldcombe suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Oldcombe which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Oldcombe was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Oldcombe is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Oldcombe is is constructed arround a semi-circular narrow baked earthen mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The valley city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Oldcombe has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Oldcombe long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Oldcombe hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with. This hate may spring from recent events, or it may be an inherited spite from old wrongs.</p>
<p>Oldcombe's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Oldcombe.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

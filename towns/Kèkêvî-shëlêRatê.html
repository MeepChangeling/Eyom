<p>The name Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Hêbêip8481489d.html">Hêbê</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1438, by Hêbê. The establishment of Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive gravel streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 3 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami spared the town from an attack. One of Kèkêvî-shëlê Ratê's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<p>Nal Gu Hadfow (/nal/ /gu/ [current] [cream]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Gde̜ngwatyodMoot.html">Gde̜ngwatyod Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nal Gu Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nal Gu Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Angharanzbtbhlyc8.html">Anghara</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nal Gu Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 5°C (41°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Nal Gu Hadfow receives an average of 210 cm/y (82 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Nal Gu Hadfow covers an area of nearly 157 km<sup>2</sup> (62 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1030 m (3379 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nal Gu Hadfow was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1506, by Anghara. The establishment of Nal Gu Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Anghara struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Nal Gu Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Nal Gu Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nal Gu Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Nal Gu Hadfow is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt packed earth streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Nal Gu Hadfow's millitarily questionable fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Nal Gu Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Nal Gu Hadfow ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Nal Gu Hadfow is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Nal Gu Hadfow was like during the glorydays.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Nal Gu Hadfow is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>

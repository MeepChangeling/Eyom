<p>The name Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu was founded by <a href="../people/Vú̄b̪f̄Rē̄CherlyHeavenGóoīnḱGōw̄yHa̋chībnisSesheshethrdBekjf88a3lsm2.html">Vú̄b̪f̄ Rē̄ 'Cherly Heaven' Góoīnḱ Gōw̄y Ha̋chīb nis Sesheshet hrd Bek</a>, who was culturaly Ancient.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 18°C (64°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu receives an average of 270 cm/y (106 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 0 m (0 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu was founded durring the early 18th century in late summer of the year 1713, by Vú̄b̪f̄ Rē̄ 'Cherly Heaven' Góoīnḱ Gōw̄y Ha̋chīb nis Sesheshet hrd Bek. The establishment of Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu's construction back out of the project. Vú̄b̪f̄ Rē̄ 'Cherly Heaven' Góoīnḱ Gōw̄y Ha̋chīb nis Sesheshet hrd Bek pushed on reguardles, and Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu was built using the conventions of Ancient durring the early 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the town as needed.</p>
<p>The town shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu's parks.</p>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu.</p>

<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu's grid is powered by hydrogalvanic generators.</p>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. In spite of the Galvanic Grid, these lights continue to use their old fule sources to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu is home to a distinct subculture, who are either the majority here or have the dominant positions in the community. Architecture, local laws, and social customs are all tuned to suit them, and they may not be particularly forgiving or friendly to the major culture of the region. Communities that are not outright independent usually make an arm's-length submission to a local lord.</p>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is skipped in Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Nopo Trtpoqu Yoiu suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

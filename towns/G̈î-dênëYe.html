<p>G̈î-dênë Ye (/g̃ɪ/ /ˈdɘnë/ [different; other; distinct; various; unique] [compliment]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HansaCanton.html">Hansa Canton</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name G̈î-dênë Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as G̈î-dênë Ye was founded by <a href="../people/Tshêjayxyty8h5s.html">Tshêj</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>G̈î-dênë Ye has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). G̈î-dênë Ye receives an average of 252 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. G̈î-dênë Ye covers an area of nearly 271 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1828 m (5997 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>G̈î-dênë Ye was founded durring the early 18th century in late fall of the year 1738, by Tshêj. The establishment of G̈î-dênë Ye  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding G̈î-dênë Ye's construction back out of the project. Tshêj pushed on reguardles, and G̈î-dênë Ye was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>G̈î-dênë Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and G̈î-dênë Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>G̈î-dênë Ye is is constructed arround a semi-circular broad cobblestone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The city's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat G̈î-dênë Ye hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, G̈î-dênë Ye was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is G̈î-dênë Ye lost 280 people, 349 livestock, and 57 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 197, when members of G̈î-dênë Ye's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular solgiers group to a safe location. The operation was complicated by the army's activities draw the wrath of formerly neutral parties. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for G̈î-dênë Ye's forces.

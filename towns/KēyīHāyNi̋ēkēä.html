<p>Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä (/kīːjɪ̄/ /hɑ̄iː/ [arrogant] [mirror]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GīmōthyǎvyRegion.html">Gīmōthyǎvy Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/SnocthêGlèbëKhêvv684mad85i.html">Snocthê Glèbë Khêv</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 14°C (57°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 248 cm/y (97 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 140 km<sup>2</sup> (56 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2260 m (7414 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1103, by Snocthê Glèbë Khêv. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Snocthê Glèbë Khêv.</p>
<p>Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Kēyī Hāy Ni̋ēkēä's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

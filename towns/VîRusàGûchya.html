<p>The name Vî Rusà Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Vî Rusà Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Truthnurjj3uf3bxt.html">Truthnu</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vî Rusà Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -11°C (13°F). Vî Rusà Gûchya receives an average of 287 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Vî Rusà Gûchya covers an area of nearly 83 km<sup>2</sup> (33 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1934 m (6345 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vî Rusà Gûchya was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1518, by Truthnu. The establishment of Vî Rusà Gûchya suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Vî Rusà Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vî Rusà Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vî Rusà Gûchya is was constructed arround several premissive packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Vî Rusà Gûchya's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Vî Rusà Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Vî Rusà Gûchya suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Vî Rusà Gûchya long.</p>

It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Híhiveshíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Híhiveshíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v’s streets.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami solved a major long term problem plaguing the town. One of Híhiveshíhg Ji̊ Qi̊v's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

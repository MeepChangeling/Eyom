<p>Ko-bika Ratê (/ko/ /ˈbika/ [maroon] [folder]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/TêtlîfaCounty.html">Têtlîfa County</a>, <a href="../provences/PifîkèliProvence.html">Pifîkèli Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ko-bika Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ko-bika Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Theggvong6u2b7w8z09.html">Theggvong</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Ko-bika Ratê receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Ko-bika Ratê covers an area of nearly 11 km<sup>2</sup> (4 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4652 m (15262 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê was founded durring the late 9th century, by Theggvong. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ko-bika Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Ko-bika Ratê's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ko-bika Ratê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Ko-bika Ratê. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Ko-bika Ratê's parks.</p>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Ko-bika Ratê.</p>

<p>Ko-bika Ratê's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Ko-bika Ratê's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Ko-bika Ratê rainbows form quite often above the Small City.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Howler.html">Howler</a> near Ko-bika Ratê are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Ko-bika Ratê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Illusion energies of tier 3 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Ko-bika Ratê has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Ko-bika Ratê is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with good fortune for a year and a day. One of Ko-bika Ratê's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mentsë-frot Gri was founded durring the late 10th century, by Èqtêv. The establishment of Mentsë-frot Gri suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Mentsë-frot Gri which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Mentsë-frot Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mentsë-frot Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Mentsë-frot Gri is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The city's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Mentsë-frot Gri seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Mentsë-frot Gri was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Mentsë-frot Gri lost 209 people, 247 livestock, and 69 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 145, when members of Mentsë-frot Gri's militia enacted an operation to recruit a particular solgiers group. The operation was complicated by a natural disaster interrupted the operation, shattering unit cohesion. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Mentsë-frot Gri's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Mentsë-frot Gri's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

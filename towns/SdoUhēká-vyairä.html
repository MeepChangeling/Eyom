<p>The name Sdo Uhēká-vyairä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Sdo Uhēká-vyairä was founded by Ditela Thiselton-Dyer Nash, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sdo Uhēká-vyairä was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1439, by Ditela Thiselton-Dyer Nash. The establishment of Sdo Uhēká-vyairä  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Sdo Uhēká-vyairä's construction back out of the project. Ditela Thiselton-Dyer Nash pushed on reguardles, and Sdo Uhēká-vyairä was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Sdo Uhēká-vyairä was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sdo Uhēká-vyairä is no diffrent. The metropolis's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Sdo Uhēká-vyairä is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad flagstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The byou metropolis is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Sdo Uhēká-vyairä, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Sdo Uhēká-vyairä gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Sdo Uhēká-vyairä brings to mind.</p>

<p>The name Mûyî Eyi Higu̹ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Mûyî Eyi Higu̹ was founded by <a href="../people/Gadshèjyvvgbsz6gi.html">Gadshèj</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mûyî Eyi Higu̹ was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1285, by Gadshèj. The establishment of Mûyî Eyi Higu̹ suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Mûyî Eyi Higu̹ which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Mûyî Eyi Higu̹ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mûyî Eyi Higu̹ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Mûyî Eyi Higu̹ is buildings are built arround a single restrictive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The robustly designed timber walls has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Mûyî Eyi Higu̹, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Mûyî Eyi Higu̹.</p>

<p>Mary Crow (/ˈmɛri kroʊ/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Town located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHobben.html">Kingdom of Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mary Crow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mary Crow was founded by <a href="../people/IanHectorphkiguzaa9.html">Ian Hector</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mary Crow has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Mary Crow receives an average of 250 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Mary Crow covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1166 m (3825 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mary Crow was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1306, by Ian Hector. The establishment of Mary Crow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Mary Crow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Mary Crow was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mary Crow is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Mary Crow is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad baked earthen streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the town is well defended against anything short of an army. The town's cost-cutting-focused defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>Looking around Mary Crow you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Mary Crow possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Mary Crow has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Mary Crow. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Mary Crow's parks.</p>
<p>Mary Crow has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Mary Crow.</p>
<p>Mary Crow has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Mary Crow has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Mary Crow has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Mary Crow's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Mary Crow possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Mary Crow's grid is powered by a boiler and turbine based power plant.</p>
<p>Mary Crow has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Mary Crow's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Mary Crow has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Mary Crow has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Mary Crow's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Mary Crow the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿LeshyLichen.html">﻿Leshy, Lichen</a> near Mary Crow are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Mary Crow's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves line dance to channel Augury energies of tier 1 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Mary Crow was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Mary Crow possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century several years of heavy rains culminated in a peculiar disaster. A great hole opened up beneath Mary Crow, swallowing large sections of the community. Mary Crow lost 295 people, 399 livestock, and 25 buildings in the disaster. This disaster is often refereed to as The Dread Swallowing.</p>

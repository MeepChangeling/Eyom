<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka (/vɪh/ /ə̝x/ [live] [visit]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/Lv-326qmiwzèZone.html">Lv-326qmiwzè Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/Pz-339jnupDistrict.html">Pz-339jnup District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka was founded by <a href="../people/Zr-12oDavidShêbethqqkzc5dz.html">Zr-12o 'David' Shêbe</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka receives an average of 255 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1664 m (5459 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1401, by Zr-12o 'David' Shêbe. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka is is constructed  arround a series of narrow paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  town rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The town's political statment focused walls have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire town feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a town, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka's parks.</p>

<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LeshyPoppy.html">Leshy, Poppy</a> near Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves square dance to channel Illusion energies of tier 3 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka lost 115 people, 193 livestock, and 49 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 204, when members of Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific warchest to a particular fortification unharmed. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the fortification, which ended in victory for Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Vǐh Ăkh Birěkhka's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

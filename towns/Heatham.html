<p>Heatham  (/heatham / [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/NetalipoCounty.html">Netalipo County</a>, <a href="../provences/DamozajiuCounty.html">Damozajiu County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Heatham  is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Heatham  was founded by <a href="../people/Gä̌shRawmpf̄̌shBubleChuckCogDā̌Ra̋nḱMbó̄Potterfqzlbpdf61.html">Gä̌sh Rawmpf̄̌sh 'Buble Chuck Cog' Dā̌ Ra̋nḱ Mbó̄ Potter</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Heatham  has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Heatham  receives an average of 165 cm/y (64 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Heatham  covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6486 m (21279 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Heatham  was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1295, by Gä̌sh Rawmpf̄̌sh 'Buble Chuck Cog' Dā̌ Ra̋nḱ Mbó̄ Potter. The establishment of Heatham   was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Heatham 's construction back out of the project. Gä̌sh Rawmpf̄̌sh 'Buble Chuck Cog' Dā̌ Ra̋nḱ Mbó̄ Potter pushed on reguardles, and Heatham  was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Heatham  was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Heatham  is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Heatham  is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of narrow cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Heatham 's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Heatham 's political statment focused walls are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the town as needed.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Heatham . The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Heatham  possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Heatham  has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Heatham . They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Heatham 's parks.</p>
<p>Heatham  has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Heatham .</p>
<p>Heatham  has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Heatham  has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Heatham  has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Heatham 's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Heatham  possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Heatham 's grid is powered by an arcane means.</p>
<p>Heatham 's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Heatham  has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Heatham 's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Heatham  has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Heatham  has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Heatham  they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>
<p>Heatham 's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Heatham  the stars are always right.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\MudElementalLarge.html">Mud Elemental, Large</a> near Heatham  are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Heatham 's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves creating small tokens to channel Augury energies of tier 2 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Heatham  is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kágeco-éij Savannah was struck by a drought when Pond Witless grew too small to continue feeding Backwater Slumbrous, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Heatham . As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Heatham  lost 202 people, and 267 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 2 weeks, which are remembered as the Heartbreak Thirst.</p>

<p>Boke Bi̊cquw (/bi̘c/ /quw/ [underwear] [hollow]) is a subtropical Small City located in the <a href="../provences/TstifurRegion.html">Tstifur Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Bi̊cquw is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Bi̊cquw was founded by <a href="../people/Tregênkèju9i1f2s1zu.html">Tregênkèj</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Bi̊cquw has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Boke Bi̊cquw receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Bi̊cquw covers an area of nearly 16 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 224 m (734 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Bi̊cquw was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1383, by Tregênkèj. The establishment of Boke Bi̊cquw suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Boke Bi̊cquw which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Boke Bi̊cquw was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Bi̊cquw is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Bi̊cquw is buildings are located arround a single premissive flagstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Boke Bi̊cquw's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Boke Bi̊cquw, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all preforming the same rituals to bless and anoint building,s streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holysymbols is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This city certainly loves its god.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Boke Bi̊cquw's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Boke Bi̊cquw there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SnakeConstrictor(Anaconda).html">Snake, Constrictor (Anaconda)</a> near Boke Bi̊cquw are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Boke Bi̊cquw's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Illusion energies of tier 1 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Boke Bi̊cquw was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Boke Bi̊cquw. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Bi̊cquw lost 164 people, 294 livestock, and 68 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 51, when members of Boke Bi̊cquw's militia enacted an operation to locate a particular solgiers group. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in victory for Boke Bi̊cquw's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Boke Bi̊cquw's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

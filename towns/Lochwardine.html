<p>Lochwardine (/lochwardine/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/CliffviewDutchy.html">Cliffview Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/KobianKingdom.html">Kobian Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lochwardine is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lochwardine was founded by <a href="../people/KunobenaDownsdxznj52sqa.html">Kunobena Downs</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lochwardine has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Lochwardine receives an average of 262 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Lochwardine covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1128 m (3700 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lochwardine was founded durring the late 11th century, by Kunobena Downs. The establishment of Lochwardine suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Lochwardine was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lochwardine is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature stone brick construction with most buildings posessing towers, turrets, dormers, and wide wrap-around porches. An extreem emphasis on decorative features and emblishments can be seen even on the poorest of homes and makes even the most humble of structures seem a bit regal.</p>
<p>Lochwardine is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the town is well defended against anything short of an army. Astonishigly, the cost-cutting-focused defences are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Lochwardine has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Lochwardine ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Lochwardine is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the town. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lochwardine long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Lochwardine has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Lochwardine. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Lochwardine's parks.</p>
<p>Lochwardine has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Lochwardine.</p>
<p>Lochwardine has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Lochwardine has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Lochwardine has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Lochwardine's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Lochwardine possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Lochwardine's grid is powered by an arcane means.</p>
<p>Lochwardine has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Lochwardine's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Lochwardine has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Lochwardine has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Lochwardine is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lochwardine's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Lochwardine during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Soulsliver.html">Soulsliver</a> near Lochwardine are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Lochwardine's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves square dance to channel Mysticism energies of tier 1 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Lochwardine produces something unique, a good or service that cannot be had anywhere else in the kingdom. This may be due to some unique resource found only there, or some carefully-guarded craft, or it may be a special service that can only be provided by the locals, who are somehow unique in their forms or abilities.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Lochwardine was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lochwardine lost 165 people, 313 livestock, and 46 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 126, when members of Lochwardine's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy faction leader. The operation was complicated by the militia had access to far less resources than expected. The conflict ended with the defense of the strategic location against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Lochwardine's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lochwardine's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

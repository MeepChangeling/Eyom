<p>The name Noia Köf Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Noia Köf Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Fadhisaqd56sw45hh.html">Fadhisa</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Noia Köf Hadfow was founded durring the late 11th century, by Fadhisa. The establishment of Noia Köf Hadfow  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Noia Köf Hadfow's construction back out of the project. Fadhisa pushed on reguardles, and Noia Köf Hadfow was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Noia Köf Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Noia Köf Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Noia Köf Hadfow is buildings folow an organic layout of narrow cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Noia Köf Hadfow, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Noia Köf Hadfow's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Noia Köf Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Noia Köf Hadfow long.</p>

<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy.

Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>

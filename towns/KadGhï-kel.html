<p>Kad Ghï-kel (/if/ /kel/ [middle] [powder]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ghotimunrī̄kPrincipality.html">Ghotimunrī̄k Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kaigi.html">Kaigi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Ghï-kel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Ghï-kel was founded by <a href="../people/Szelzusn56rqkz54h.html">Szelzus</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Ghï-kel has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a freezing -2°C (29°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Kad Ghï-kel receives an average of 222 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kad Ghï-kel covers an area of nearly 188 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1828 m (5997 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Ghï-kel was founded durring the early 9th century, by Szelzus. The establishment of Kad Ghï-kel suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Kad Ghï-kel which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Kad Ghï-kel was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Ghï-kel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kad Ghï-kel is buildings are located arround a single restrictive baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Kad Ghï-kel's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kad Ghï-kel hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Ghï-kel's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Kad Ghï-kel.</p>

<p>Kad Ghï-kel's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves orgies to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 1 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

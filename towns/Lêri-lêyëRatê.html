<p>The name Lêri-lêyë Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lêri-lêyë Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Gelè8xrlic9337.html">Gelè</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lêri-lêyë Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Lêri-lêyë Ratê receives an average of 123 cm/y (48 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lêri-lêyë Ratê covers an area of nearly 166 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1790 m (5872 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lêri-lêyë Ratê was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1147, by Gelè. The establishment of Lêri-lêyë Ratê was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Gelè electing to pay people to resettle in Lêri-lêyë Ratê.</p>
<p>Lêri-lêyë Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lêri-lêyë Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Lêri-lêyë Ratê is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad canals streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Lêri-lêyë Ratê's Ragnarock-era relics has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Lêri-lêyë Ratê has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Lêri-lêyë Ratê ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Lêri-lêyë Ratê is surrounded by dangerous terrain: miasmatic swamps, perilous crevasses, radioactive badlands, a pocket of or some other harmful topography. Lêri-lêyë Ratê might prefer the defensive potential of the terrain here, or have found a precious resource worth the danger. The terrain might have formed at some time since the founding, with the citizens struggling to make terms with the new danger.</p>
<p>Lêri-lêyë Ratê's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Lêri-lêyë Ratê suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

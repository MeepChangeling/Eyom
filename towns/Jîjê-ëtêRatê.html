<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jîjê-ëtê Ratê was founded durring the early 9th century, by Haw̋mp̪f̄ Gāy 'Bite Gorgeous' Daw̄ Có̄bō Cúńó̄sh. The establishment of Jîjê-ëtê Ratê  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Jîjê-ëtê Ratê's construction back out of the project. Haw̋mp̪f̄ Gāy 'Bite Gorgeous' Daw̄ Có̄bō Cúńó̄sh pushed on reguardles, and Jîjê-ëtê Ratê was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Jîjê-ëtê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jîjê-ëtê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Jîjê-ëtê Ratê is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt flagstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Jîjê-ëtê Ratê's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Astonishigly, the unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Jîjê-ëtê Ratê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Jîjê-ëtê Ratê was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Jîjê-ëtê Ratê. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Jîjê-ëtê Ratê lost 167 people, 224 livestock, and 55 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 137, when members of Jîjê-ëtê Ratê's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular strategic location to a safe location. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Jîjê-ëtê Ratê's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Jîjê-ëtê Ratê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Jîjê-ëtê Ratê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Mêndën-sêbè Ratê (/ˈbejè/ /ˈsɘbè/ [perfect] [flake]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/YafokzèZone.html">Yafokzè Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/JĭǐkhěnDistrict.html">Jĭǐkhěn District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Alveria.html">Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mêndën-sêbè Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mêndën-sêbè Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Glkëmêpí4mcrvm1xyu.html">Glkëmêpí</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mêndën-sêbè Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Mêndën-sêbè Ratê receives an average of 201 cm/y (79 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Mêndën-sêbè Ratê covers an area of nearly 87 km<sup>2</sup> (34 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2366 m (7762 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mêndën-sêbè Ratê was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1254, by Glkëmêpí. The establishment of Mêndën-sêbè Ratê was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Glkëmêpí electing to pay people to resettle in Mêndën-sêbè Ratê.</p>
<p>Mêndën-sêbè Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mêndën-sêbè Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Mêndën-sêbè Ratê is buildings are arranged within a network of broad carved bedrock streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Mêndën-sêbè Ratê's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Mêndën-sêbè Ratê's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Mêndën-sêbè Ratê, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

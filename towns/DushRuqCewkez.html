<p>The name Dush Ruq Cewkez is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Dush Ruq Cewkez was founded by <a href="../people/GultharmZÿhndtubqugbuhezmi3s3k2snk.html">Gultharm Zÿhndtubqugbuhez</a>, who was culturaly Dwarvern.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dush Ruq Cewkez was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1269, by Gultharm Zÿhndtubqugbuhez. The establishment of Dush Ruq Cewkez  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Dush Ruq Cewkez's construction back out of the project. Gultharm Zÿhndtubqugbuhez pushed on reguardles, and Dush Ruq Cewkez was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Dush Ruq Cewkez was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dush Ruq Cewkez is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Dush Ruq Cewkez is is constructed arround a semi-circular premissive packed earth mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The exceptionaly well made fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Dush Ruq Cewkez hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<p>Dush Ruq Cewkez's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

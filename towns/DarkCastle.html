<p>Dark Castle (/dɑrk/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ValebourneDutchy.html">Valebourne Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MidateKingdom.html">Midate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dark Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Dark Castle was founded by <a href="../people/IzsrangWorralljg4gif4fsj.html">Izsrang Worrall</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dark Castle has a yearly average temperature of 10°C (50°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 14°C (57°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F). Dark Castle receives an average of 234 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Dark Castle covers an area of nearly 174 km<sup>2</sup> (69 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1350 m (4429 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dark Castle was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1126, by Izsrang Worrall. The establishment of Dark Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Dark Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dark Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Dark Castle is was constructed arround several narrow flagstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Dark Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Dark Castle, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Dark Castle.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Dark Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>In Dark Castle sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<p>Dark Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves bloodletting to channel Mysticism energies of tier 3 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Dark Castle has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>
<p>Dark Castle has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>

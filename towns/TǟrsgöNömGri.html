<p>Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri (/ˈtaːrsgo˞/ /no˞m/ [vague; fuzzy; obscure] [combat]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ko̠ktugttöMoot.html">Ko̠ktugttö Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Firnipuc7r1md4wii.html">Firnipu</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri receives an average of 149 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri covers an area of nearly 81 km<sup>2</sup> (32 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4156 m (13635 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1507, by Firnipu. The establishment of Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Firnipu struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri is is constructed  arround a series of crampt paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri shows Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri's residents established a new industry 2 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri lost 196 people, 333 livestock, and 45 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 201, when members of Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri's militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular enemy war machine. The operation was complicated by the enemy forces had far more numbers than estimated. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Tǟrsgö Nöm Gri's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

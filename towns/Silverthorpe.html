<p>Silverthorpe (/ˈsɪlvə/ /θɔːp/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SouthwynDutchy.html">Southwyn Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DraxningCounty.html">Draxning County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Silverthorpe is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Silverthorpe was founded by Trteshêv Douglas, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Silverthorpe has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Silverthorpe receives an average of 217 cm/y (85 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Silverthorpe covers an area of nearly 479 km<sup>2</sup> (191 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3316 m (10879 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Silverthorpe was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1344, by Trteshêv Douglas. The establishment of Silverthorpe was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Trteshêv Douglas struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Silverthorpe as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Silverthorpe was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Silverthorpe is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Silverthorpe is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive baked earthen streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The lakeside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Silverthorpe, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Silverthorpe makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Silverthorpe's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>In Silverthorpe most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LivingTopiary.html">Living Topiary</a> near Silverthorpe are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Silverthorpe's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Augury energies of tier 2 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Silverthorpe was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Silverthorpe lost 150 people, 359 livestock, and 32 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 150, when members of Silverthorpe's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by extremely hostile wildlife which took many out of action. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Silverthorpe's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Silverthorpe's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

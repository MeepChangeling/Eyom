<p>Jahe-zmemol Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jahe-zmemol Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Jahe-zmemol Xluwuf is is constructed arround a semi-circular spacious paverstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points.

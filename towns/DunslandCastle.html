<p>Dunsland Castle (/dunsland/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate City located in <a href="../subprovences/EsterbeachDutchy.html">Esterbeach Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/RodanKingdom.html">Rodan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dunsland Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Dunsland Castle was founded by <a href="../people/GiantBlackWidowSpidersLeslie4c22vn91k0.html">Giant Black Widow Spiders Leslie</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dunsland Castle has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Dunsland Castle receives an average of 120 cm/y (47 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Dunsland Castle covers an area of nearly 34 km<sup>2</sup> (13 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 12896 m (-639 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dunsland Castle was founded durring the early 11th century, by Giant Black Widow Spiders Leslie. The establishment of Dunsland Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Giant Black Widow Spiders Leslie struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Dunsland Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Dunsland Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dunsland Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Dunsland Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad baked earthen streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Dunsland Castle's millitarily questionable fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Dunsland Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Dunsland Castle is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

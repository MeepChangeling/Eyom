<p>Pillrow Castle (/pillrow/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in the <a href="../provences/IzcleaRegion.html">Izclea Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Pillrow Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Pillrow Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TsaykhiArtell9x1j5pu12u.html">Tsaykhi Artell</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Pillrow Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Pillrow Castle receives an average of 253 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Pillrow Castle covers an area of nearly 17 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2762 m (9061 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Pillrow Castle was founded durring the early 17th century in early summer of the year 1632, by Tsaykhi Artell. The establishment of Pillrow Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tsaykhi Artell struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Pillrow Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Pillrow Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Pillrow Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Pillrow Castle is buildings folow an organic layout of premissive cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Pillrow Castle's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Pillrow Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Pillrow Castle has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.</p>
<p>Pillrow Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Pillrow Castle sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

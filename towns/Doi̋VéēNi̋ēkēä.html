<p>The name Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/EingdeiDeaddiyTegmeggi3cdl5h8.html">Eingdei Deaddiy Tegme</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F).

Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 102 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5802 m (19035 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 16th century in summer of the year 1487, by Eingdei Deaddiy Tegme. The establishment of Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä is is constructed  arround a series of narrow paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿IceElementalLarge.html">﻿Ice Elemental, Large</a> near Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Doi̋ Véē Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves line dance to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 1 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Mite Castle (/maɪt/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mite Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mite Castle was founded by <a href="../people/MillicentAustinu07mxv2xh9.html">Millicent Austin</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mite Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Mite Castle receives an average of 261 cm/y (102 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Mite Castle covers an area of nearly 120 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2150 m (7053 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mite Castle was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1066, by Millicent Austin. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Mite Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mite Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Mite Castle is buildings are built arround a single restrictive baked earthen mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Mite Castle's failry decent fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Mite Castle gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. A second look around Mite Castle makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Mite Castle was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Mite Castle is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami spared the town from the rampage of a legendary monster. One of Mite Castle's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<p>Jubilee Castle (/ˈʤubəˌli/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GumadaProvence.html">Gumada Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jubilee Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Jubilee Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TselêArnoldjtj8wkc62h.html">Tselê Arnold</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jubilee Castle has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Jubilee Castle receives an average of 278 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Jubilee Castle covers an area of nearly 96 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4206 m (13799 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jubilee Castle was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1087, by Tselê Arnold. The establishment of Jubilee Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Jubilee Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jubilee Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Jubilee Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious baked earthen streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Jubilee Castle weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The budget focused millitary grade defenses have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Jubilee Castle is like looking into a university’s plaza on the day before an exam. People rush about to-and-fro. Discarded scrolls and quills are dotted around  city. In spite of many locals discussing academic topics, there’s little sign of any organized groups for any of that talk. Infact, the city seems disordered in general with everything scattered helter skelter about.</p>

<p>Jubilee Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Jubilee Castle was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Jubilee Castle lost 112 people, 320 livestock, and 21 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 36, when members of Jubilee Castle's militia enacted an operation to fortify a particular strategic location. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a crushing defeat for Jubilee Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Jubilee Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

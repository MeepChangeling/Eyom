<p>The name Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/GiantAssassinSpidersvw5kkum8d9.html">Giant Assassin Spiders</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1417, by Giant Assassin Spiders. The establishment of Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Giant Assassin Spiders electing to pay people to resettle in Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>
<p>Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v is is constructed  arround a series of narrow cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v's unusual though effective defenses has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife.</p>

<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v which is rapidly gaining power.

Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Èq Wæzǐ Woodlands was struck by a drought when Lake Gater grew too small to continue feeding Waterway Shefburn, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Spshziēàgèqog Ji̊ Qi̊v lost 248 people, and 158 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 1 weeks, which are remembered as the Ill Tides Thirst.</p>

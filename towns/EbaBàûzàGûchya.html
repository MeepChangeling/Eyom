<p>The name Eba Bàûzà Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Eba Bàûzà Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Shêgèqth6v44h7nvw5.html">Shêgèqth</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Eba Bàûzà Gûchya was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1414, by Shêgèqth. The establishment of Eba Bàûzà Gûchya  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Eba Bàûzà Gûchya's construction back out of the project. Shêgèqth pushed on reguardles, and Eba Bàûzà Gûchya was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Eba Bàûzà Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Eba Bàûzà Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Eba Bàûzà Gûchya is buildings are arranged within a network of premissive baked earthen streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Eba Bàûzà Gûchya gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. A second look around Eba Bàûzà Gûchya makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Eba Bàûzà Gûchya was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Eba Bàûzà Gûchya lost 266 people, 276 livestock, and 46 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 76, when members of Eba Bàûzà Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular port. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Eba Bàûzà Gûchya's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Eba Bàûzà Gûchya's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

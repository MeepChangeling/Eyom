<p>Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v (Spsto /ˈəmbi̘g/ [land; ground] [explanation]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/NijhobbubRegion.html">Nijhobbub Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Colleen7h6w6ut4bb.html">Colleen</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 33°C (91°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 36°C (96°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 30°C (86°F). Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 184 cm/y (72 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 27 km<sup>2</sup> (10 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 564 m (1850 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 10th century, by Colleen. The establishment of Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Colleen electing to pay people to resettle in Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>
<p>Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v is is constructed  arround a series of crampt packed earth mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v shows Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

<p>Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>
<p>Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v lost 183 people, 293 livestock, and 48 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 71, when members of Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v's militia enacted an operation to train a specific solgiers group for an upcoming operation. The operation was complicated by the militia had access to far less resources than expected. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a stalemate for Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Spstoàmbi̊g Ji̊ Qi̊v's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>The name Edê-tegî Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Edê-tegî Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/CaveFishersukw8f4wtkl.html">Cave Fishers</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>

<p>Edê-tegî Ratê was founded durring the late 17th century in late spring of the year 1653, by Cave Fishers. The establishment of Edê-tegî Ratê was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Cave Fishers struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Edê-tegî Ratê as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Edê-tegî Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Edê-tegî Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Edê-tegî Ratê is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad flagstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The city's robustly designed timber walls are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Edê-tegî Ratê is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods.

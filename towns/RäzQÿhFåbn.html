<p>The name Räz Qÿh Fåbn is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Qÿh Fåbn was founded by <a href="../people/Trêbmthe522jm221n7.html">Trêbmthe</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Räz Qÿh Fåbn has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Räz Qÿh Fåbn receives an average of 252 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Räz Qÿh Fåbn covers an area of nearly 132 km<sup>2</sup> (52 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1868 m (6128 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Qÿh Fåbn was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1095, by Trêbmthe. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Trêbmthe.</p>
<p>Räz Qÿh Fåbn was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Qÿh Fåbn is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Qÿh Fåbn is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Räz Qÿh Fåbn's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Räz Qÿh Fåbn is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Räz Qÿh Fåbn's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Räz Qÿh Fåbn suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 5 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami spared the town from an attack. One of Räz Qÿh Fåbn's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

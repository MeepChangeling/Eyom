<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh (/kə̝ˈdrɛme/ /jɪh/ [real] [step (footstep)]) is a subtropical Large Town located in <a href="../subprovences/Ls-8kmæziqZone.html">Ls-8kmæziq Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/Ot-61esìbDistrict.html">Ot-61esìb District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh was founded by <a href="../people/OlwenGlënmqjgmrs4fzt.html">Olwen Glënm</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh receives an average of 216 cm/y (85 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4838 m (15872 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1485, by Olwen Glënm. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh is was constructed arround several broad paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh’s streets. The town is very clearly a joyfull place as well as relaxing. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's parks.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>

<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large Town. Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's grid is powered by a boiler and turbine based power plant.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's citizens locals enjoy many vices and lustful appetites. They may have religious sanction for their deeds, or neighbors might trade with them for such things, or they could be followers of some ideology that blesses such pursuits. Their economy or their social organization is usually heavily reliant on such traffic, and to ensure its continuance they may have made bargains with various mortal and immortal powers.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh vermin leave small tokens in payment for food taken.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\WolfDire.html">Wolf, Dire</a> near Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Wæm Kădrěme Yǐh's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Transmutation energies of tier 3 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Mere Rupa began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which devastated , killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. An estimated  people,  livestock, and  buildings were lost to the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Suffering Wind.</p>

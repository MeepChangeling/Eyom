<p>The name Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Celaethacuslzufuxnmfy.html">Celaethacus</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1114, by Celaethacus. The establishment of Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow's construction back out of the project. Celaethacus pushed on reguardles, and Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad gravel streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Vlǟ-vreflö Hadfow brings to mind.</p>

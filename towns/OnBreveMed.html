<p>On Breve Med (/on/ /ˈbreve/ [green; raw] [cage; crate]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CerghymmachaCounty.html">Cerghymmacha County</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name On Breve Med is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as On Breve Med was founded by Yāy Ga̋chvó̄ 'Amethyst Shy' Ra̋g Cúchīb Vúń̄ Dhando, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>On Breve Med has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F). On Breve Med receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. On Breve Med covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7434 m (-18559 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>On Breve Med was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1195, by Yāy Ga̋chvó̄ 'Amethyst Shy' Ra̋g Cúchīb Vúń̄ Dhando. The establishment of On Breve Med  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding On Breve Med's construction back out of the project. Yāy Ga̋chvó̄ 'Amethyst Shy' Ra̋g Cúchīb Vúń̄ Dhando pushed on reguardles, and On Breve Med was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>On Breve Med was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and On Breve Med is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>On Breve Med is is constructed  arround a series of crampt packed earth mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The mountain city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Astonishigly, the failry decent fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>On Breve Med has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled On Breve Med ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that On Breve Med is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in On Breve Med long.</p>

<p>Bîo-êdê Ye (/ˈbɪo/ /ˈɘdɘ/ [attractive] [girl]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/FêyozaCounty.html">Fêyoza County</a>, <a href="../provences/CeliondraCounty.html">Celiondra County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bîo-êdê Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Bîo-êdê Ye was founded by Audrey, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bîo-êdê Ye has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Bîo-êdê Ye receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Bîo-êdê Ye covers an area of nearly 275 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5938 m (19481 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bîo-êdê Ye was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1273, by Audrey. The establishment of Bîo-êdê Ye  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Bîo-êdê Ye's construction back out of the project. Audrey pushed on reguardles, and Bîo-êdê Ye was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Bîo-êdê Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bîo-êdê Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Bîo-êdê Ye is buildings are speckled and packed arround restrictive packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The byou city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Bîo-êdê Ye, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Bîo-êdê Ye's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Bîo-êdê Ye hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Bîo-êdê Ye is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>A substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign settlement conquered within the relatively recent past. The locals may not be enthusiastic about being ruled by others not of their kind, and their neighbors may look askance at the way foreign customs or even laws may be maintained.</p>
<p>Bîo-êdê Ye's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Bîo-êdê Ye there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Apallie.html">Apallie</a> near Bîo-êdê Ye are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Bîo-êdê Ye's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves bloodletting to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 2 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

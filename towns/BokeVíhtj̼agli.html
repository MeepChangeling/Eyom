<p>Boke Víhtj̼agli (/vɪ̞t/ /ˈj̼agli/ [slope; slant] [gorgeous]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FtiyāobātRegion.html">Ftiyāobāt Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Víhtj̼agli is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Víhtj̼agli was founded by <a href="../people/Nrëdh2rrdp1bxs.html">Nrëd</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Víhtj̼agli has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Boke Víhtj̼agli receives an average of 252 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Víhtj̼agli covers an area of nearly 122 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4230 m (13877 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Víhtj̼agli was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1256, by Nrëd. The establishment of Boke Víhtj̼agli was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Nrëd struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Boke Víhtj̼agli as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Boke Víhtj̼agli was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Víhtj̼agli is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Boke Víhtj̼agli is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious packed earth streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Boke Víhtj̼agli's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The political statment focused walls have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Víhtj̼agli is like a look into a broken heart. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need. It’s not malicious. Heads are hung. Eyes are empty. Something truly horrible happened here once upon a time and the city never healed.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Boke Víhtj̼agli possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Boke Víhtj̼agli's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Boke Víhtj̼agli.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Urdefhan.html">Urdefhan</a> near Boke Víhtj̼agli are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Boke Víhtj̼agli's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves creating small tokens to channel Mysticism energies of tier 3 via mimery.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Boke Víhtj̼agli's residents established a new industry 2 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami spared the town from the rampage of a legendary monster. One of Boke Víhtj̼agli's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

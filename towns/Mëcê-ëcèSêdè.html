<p>Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè (/jɘˈmëjɘ/ /ˈëcè/ [drunk (inebriated)] [compass]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NêndënkîteZone.html">Nêndënkîte Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè was founded by <a href="../people/Hêvwcvgwd1ixj.html">Hêv</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè receives an average of 255 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè covers an area of nearly 190 km<sup>2</sup> (76 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1886 m (6187 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1390, by Hêv. The establishment of Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive flagstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè was like during the glorydays.</p>

<p>Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century an up-welling of water from beneath the earth caused Waterway Lachlan to surge and overflow its banks. The resulting flood was isolated to the area around Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè, which was swallowed by the waters for several days. Mëcê-ëcè Sêdè lost 151 people, 136 livestock, and 36 buildings in the disaster. The disaster is remembered as the Grieving Drownings.</p>

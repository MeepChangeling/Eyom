<p>The name Lackford Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lackford Castle was founded by <a href="../people/KhêlêmTazewellknfx86xxrz.html">Khêlêm Tazewell</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lackford Castle was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1124, by Khêlêm Tazewell. The establishment of Lackford Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Lackford Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Lackford Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lackford Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Lackford Castle is is constructed  arround a series of broad baked earthen mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The city's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Lackford Castle is like a look into a broken heart which long ago fell to corruption. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need… unless of course, they would be an easy target for some robbery. The city has truly fallen to evil.</p>

<p>Lackford Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>

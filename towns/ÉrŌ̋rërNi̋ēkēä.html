<p>The name Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/TsëîdGiantHornitsLocustSwarmsywk1z6svfl.html">Tsëîd Giant Hornits Locust Swarms</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 70 cm/y (27 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 179 km<sup>2</sup> (71 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5912 m (19396 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1224, by Tsëîd Giant Hornits Locust Swarms. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a single crampt packed earth mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä's political statment focused walls has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere.

<p>Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä it is impossible to directly or indirectly lie.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century an up-welling of water from beneath the earth caused Backwater Laughing to surge and overflow its banks. The resulting flood was isolated to the area around Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä, which was swallowed by the waters for several days. Ér Ō̋rër Ni̋ēkēä lost 207 people, 279 livestock, and 42 buildings in the disaster. The disaster is remembered as the Dread Drownings.</p>

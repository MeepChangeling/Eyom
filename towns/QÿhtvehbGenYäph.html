<p>The name Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph was founded by <a href="../people/Tsese4uup06nwya.html">Tsese</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph has a yearly average temperature of 31°C (87°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 36°C (96°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph receives an average of 66 cm/y (25 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph covers an area of nearly 135 km<sup>2</sup> (54 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 17232 m (13585 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph was founded durring the early 18th century in early summer of the year 1732, by Tsese. The establishment of Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of narrow paverstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The political statment focused walls have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph long.</p>

<p>Qÿhtvehb Gen Yäph used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 2 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>

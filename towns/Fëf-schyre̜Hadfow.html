<p>The name Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Trtèjvb8zvdgi92.html">Trtèj</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F).

Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow covers an area of nearly 165 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4490 m (14730 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1243, by Trtèj. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow is buildings have been located at convienant points along the cliff Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Fëf-schyre̜ Hadfow long.</p>

<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä (/li̋ː/ /ɱǣʒɜː/ [bankrupt; broke] [necklace]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BāwkyoīäProvence.html">Bāwkyoīä Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/MlelilelHêbHêlêv5wzxw9sq3g.html">Mlelilel Hêb Hêlêv</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 268 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 94 km<sup>2</sup> (37 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2884 m (9461 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1114, by Mlelilel Hêb Hêlêv. The establishment of Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Mlelilel Hêb Hêlêv electing to pay people to resettle in Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä.</p>
<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are speckled and packed arround broad paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large City. Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä's grid is powered by an arcane means.</p>

<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä the stars are always right.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Ramidreju.html">Ramidreju</a> near Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Lé Mǟyeer Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves ritual combat to channel Charm energies of tier 2 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

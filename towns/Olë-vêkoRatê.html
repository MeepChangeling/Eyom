<p>The name Olë-vêko Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Olë-vêko Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Fyèdsepí2hj1w09da5.html">Fyèdsepí</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Olë-vêko Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Olë-vêko Ratê receives an average of 287 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Olë-vêko Ratê covers an area of nearly 215 km<sup>2</sup> (86 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5650 m (18536 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Olë-vêko Ratê was founded durring the early 10th century, by Fyèdsepí. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Olë-vêko Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Olë-vêko Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Olë-vêko Ratê is buildings folow an organic layout of crampt packed earth streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Olë-vêko Ratê's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Olë-vêko Ratê, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Olë-vêko Ratê.</p>

<p>Olë-vêko Ratê's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

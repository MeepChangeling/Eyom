<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zǎcṓē Naw̌cfáger Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 17th century in late fall of the year 1589, by Cúchīy Rawm 'Bella Lanita' Haw̋chī Ermé Rä̌shīy Mēń̄s Ma̋mbónḱ. The establishment of Zǎcṓē Naw̌cfáger Ni̋ēkēä  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Zǎcṓē Naw̌cfáger Ni̋ēkēä's construction back out of the project. Cúchīy Rawm 'Bella Lanita' Haw̋chī Ermé Rä̌shīy Mēń̄s Ma̋mbónḱ pushed on reguardles, and Zǎcṓē Naw̌cfáger Ni̋ēkēä was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Zǎcṓē Naw̌cfáger Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zǎcṓē Naw̌cfáger Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Zǎcṓē Naw̌cfáger Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt split-log ties streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Zǎcṓē Naw̌cfáger Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Zǎcṓē Naw̌cfáger Ni̋ēkēä is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä (/ŋgɛ̄/ /műːɜː/ [vicious; cruel] [shore; beach]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Thḗpō̌yeyRegion.html">Thḗpō̌yey Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/CeridwenBethMaryprghd49uvc.html">Ceridwen Beth Mary</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 271 cm/y (106 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 165 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1744 m (5721 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1119, by Ceridwen Beth Mary. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Astonishigly, the boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\CloudDragonWyrmling.html">Cloud Dragon, Wyrmling</a> near Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Conjuration energies of tier 3 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Lu̹zûyi Docho Woodlands was struck by a drought when Tarn Glendive grew too small to continue feeding Stream Marin, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Ngá̄ Mű̄er Ni̋ēkēä lost 167 people, and 131 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 2 weeks, which are remembered as the Anguish Thirst.</p>

<p>Darwen Citidel (/darwen/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/IzcleaRegion.html">Izclea Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Darwen Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Darwen Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/PangwenSlaightsv9y24iz1k.html">Pangwen Slaight</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Darwen Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Darwen Citidel receives an average of 243 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Darwen Citidel covers an area of nearly 132 km<sup>2</sup> (52 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2988 m (9803 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Darwen Citidel was founded durring the late 19th century in late spring of the year 1857, by Pangwen Slaight. The establishment of Darwen Citidel  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Darwen Citidel's construction back out of the project. Pangwen Slaight pushed on reguardles, and Darwen Citidel was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Darwen Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 19th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Darwen Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Darwen Citidel is buildings are speckled and packed arround broad paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Darwen Citidel weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Darwen Citidel's budget focused millitary grade defenses has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Darwen Citidel is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Darwen Citidel possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>Darwen Citidel has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Darwen Citidel's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Darwen Citidel has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Darwen Citidel's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used makes use of a large oblong hall or building with double colonnades and a semicircular apse and symmetrical central-plan, resulting in buildings with a square central mass and four arms of equal length. Decorative features included domed rooves, arches, soaring spaces, and sumptuous decoration: marble columns and inlay, mosaics on the vaults, inlaid-stone pavements, and sometimes gold coffered ceilings.</p>
<p>In Darwen Citidel sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<p>Darwen Citidel's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves square dance to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 1 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Darwen Citidel produces something unique, a good or service that cannot be had anywhere else in the kingdom. This may be due to some unique resource found only there, or some carefully-guarded craft, or it may be a special service that can only be provided by the locals, who are somehow unique in their forms or abilities.</p>
<p>Darwen Citidel is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Darwen Citidel was attacked by savage formianss living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Darwen Citidel lost 204 people, 205 livestock, and 96 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 175, when members of Darwen Citidel's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to a religious figure, then secure them. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Darwen Citidel's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Darwen Citidel's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

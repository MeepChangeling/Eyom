<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä (/ɛ̋ɹiː/ /kaɪ̯̂æiː˥/ [vaccine] [farmer]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Doûvnḱínts̄rRegion.html">Doûvnḱínts̄r Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/GlkëÈqtêvZlêyêpí2z1d119zzg.html">Glkë Èqtêv Zlêyêpí</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 273 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2934 m (9625 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1271, by Glkë Èqtêv Zlêyêpí. The establishment of Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä is was constructed arround several narrow baked earthen mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's cost-cutting-focused defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä shows Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's parks.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä.</p>

<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has an Millitary Academy which trains military officers and specilists.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large City. Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's grid is powered by an arcane means.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. In spite of the Galvanic Grid, these lights continue to use their old fule sources to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items.

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä leaves and flower petals never touch the ground.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\AmoebaSwarm.html">Amoeba Swarm</a> near Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Á̋ry Cîēé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves bloodletting to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 3 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

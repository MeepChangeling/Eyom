<p>Rathpore (/rɑːθ/ /pɔː/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Fersá̋ōwDutchy.html">Fersá̋ōw Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/ChisfieldiaEarldom.html">Chisfieldia Earldom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Rathpore is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Rathpore was founded by Khèsê Craven, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Rathpore has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Rathpore receives an average of 236 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Rathpore covers an area of nearly 272 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 270 m (885 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rathpore was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1250, by Khèsê Craven. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Khèsê Craven.</p>
<p>Rathpore was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rathpore is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Rathpore is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive packed earth streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The riverside city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these brittle defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Rathpore is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Rathpore possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>Rathpore has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Rathpore.

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Rathpore has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Rathpore's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Rathpore has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The law within Rathpore is highly corrupt, or does not apply to certain favored groups or castes. Strangers might be fleeced by local lawmen, evildoers can be absolved by a payment, and powerful gentry do as they please.</p>
<p>Rathpore's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>In Rathpore there is no wind.</p>

<p>Rathpore's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves orgies to channel Enchantment energies of tier 2 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Rathpore was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Rathpore. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Rathpore lost 160 people, 119 livestock, and 42 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 101, when members of Rathpore's militia enacted an operation to break a siege of a particular fortification. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Rathpore's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Rathpore's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

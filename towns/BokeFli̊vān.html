<p>The name Boke Fli̊vān is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Fli̊vān was founded by <a href="../people/Eluneth1i28juzwj7.html">Eluneth</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Fli̊vān has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F).

Boke Fli̊vān covers an area of nearly 224 km<sup>2</sup> (89 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4468 m (14658 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Fli̊vān was founded durring the early 17th century in early summer of the year 1610, by Eluneth. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Eluneth.</p>
<p>Boke Fli̊vān was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Fli̊vān is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Fli̊vān is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Boke Fli̊vān's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Boke Fli̊vān's top tier civilian fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Boke Fli̊vān hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

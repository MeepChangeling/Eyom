<p>Êkèkê Cê-îshë (/cɘ/ /ˈɪʃë/ [coral] [rodent]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NêndënkîteZone.html">Nêndënkîte Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êkèkê Cê-îshë is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Cê-îshë was founded by <a href="../people/Shnirlol2rcynj3rwl.html">Shnirlol</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Cê-îshë was founded durring the early 11th century, by Shnirlol. The establishment of Êkèkê Cê-îshë  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Êkèkê Cê-îshë's construction back out of the project. Shnirlol pushed on reguardles, and Êkèkê Cê-îshë was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Cê-îshë was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Cê-îshë is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Cê-îshë is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Êkèkê Cê-îshë, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Êkèkê Cê-îshë's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Êkèkê Cê-îshë is like a look into a broken heart which long ago fell to corruption. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need… unless of course, they would be an easy target for some robbery. The city has truly fallen to evil.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Cê-îshë's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Êkèkê Cê-îshë suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

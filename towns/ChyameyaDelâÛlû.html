<p>The name Chyameya Delâ Ûlû is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Delâ Ûlû was founded by <a href="../people/Cherylbztvuksrp5.html">Cheryl</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Delâ Ûlû was founded durring the late 11th century, by Cheryl. The establishment of Chyameya Delâ Ûlû  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Chyameya Delâ Ûlû's construction back out of the project. Cheryl pushed on reguardles, and Chyameya Delâ Ûlû was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Chyameya Delâ Ûlû was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Delâ Ûlû is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Delâ Ûlû is was constructed arround several restrictive gravel mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Chyameya Delâ Ûlû, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Chyameya Delâ Ûlû has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Chyameya Delâ Ûlû ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Chyameya Delâ Ûlû's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya (/ˈɪːdæ/ /ˈbu̽su/ [dumb (speechless)] [glacier]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BærachaVûniKingdom.html">Bæracha Vûni Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/Bæru̽saVu̽Empire.html">Bæru̽sa Vu̽ Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Berosibtsqk68yy.html">Beros</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 6°C (42°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 3°C (37°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya receives an average of 211 cm/y (83 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1482 m (4862 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1160, by Beros. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Beros.</p>
<p>Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya is is constructed  arround a series of narrow cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya's exceptionaly well made fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami granted the town a great harvest. One of Kurû Bu̽su Gûchya's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

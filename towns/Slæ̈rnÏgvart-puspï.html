<p>Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï (/ɪgˈvart/ /pusˈpɪ/ [hat; helmet] [wire]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/AjlorkPrincipality.html">Ajlork Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Shayeli.html">Shayeli</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï was founded by <a href="../people/Laihzatf3pwcuhx.html">Laihz</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1066, by Laihz. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Laihz electing to pay people to resettle in Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï is buildings have been located at convienant points along the valley Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow gravel streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p>Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>The center of Slæ̈rn Ïgvart-puspï's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>

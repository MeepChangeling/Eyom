<p>Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä (/fɒ̄/ /ndɪ́æ/ [white; blank; clear; transparent] [excrement; shit]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Doûvnḱínts̄rRegion.html">Doûvnḱínts̄r Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/TrêbmtcoZèqtcoShêbrêyeud3ugmtf1d.html">Trêbmtco Zèqtco Shêbrêye</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 273 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 81 km<sup>2</sup> (32 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3990 m (13090 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 17th century in late spring of the year 1637, by Trêbmtco Zèqtco Shêbrêye. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a single broad cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The failry decent fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with. This hate may spring from recent events, or it may be an inherited spite from old wrongs.</p>
<p>Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, curved windows, and decorative trim work. .</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä lost 184 people, 380 livestock, and 58 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 69, when members of Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to secure a particular ruin to utilize it for a specific task. The operation was complicated by extremely dangerous terrain, including unfamiliar and poisonous plants which many ate while foraging. The conflict ended with the defense of the ruin against a siege, which ended in defeat for Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Faw̄ Nidíē Ni̋ēkēä's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

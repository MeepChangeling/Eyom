<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Guwæ̈pa-njä Xluwuf was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1498, by Qrilgin. The establishment of Guwæ̈pa-njä Xluwuf suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Guwæ̈pa-njä Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Guwæ̈pa-njä Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style.

<p>Guwæ̈pa-njä Xluwuf is is constructed  arround a series of crampt cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Guwæ̈pa-njä Xluwuf is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Guwæ̈pa-njä Xluwuf is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî (/ˈdɘlo/ /ˈebè/ [crust] [flag; banner]) is a temperate Town located in the <a href="../provences/QíithtathêZone.html">Qíithtathê Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dêlo-ebè Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Dêlo-ebè Bî was founded by <a href="../people/MarysÈqthêGlkarë62x8wvsi90.html">Marys Èqthê Glkarë</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Dêlo-ebè Bî receives an average of 164 cm/y (64 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Dêlo-ebè Bî covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3990 m (13090 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî was founded durring the late 18th century in early summer of the year 1684, by Marys Èqthê Glkarë. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Marys Èqthê Glkarë.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the late 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dêlo-ebè Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî is buildings are speckled and packed arround restrictive cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the town's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a town. The  town has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Dêlo-ebè Bî's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The town's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Dêlo-ebè Bî hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Dêlo-ebè Bî. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Dêlo-ebè Bî's parks.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Dêlo-ebè Bî.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Dêlo-ebè Bî's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Dêlo-ebè Bî's grid is powered by a direct leyline tap.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Dêlo-ebè Bî's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Dêlo-ebè Bî most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Oakman.html">Oakman</a> near Dêlo-ebè Bî are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Dêlo-ebè Bî's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves drinking to channel Illusion energies of tier 2 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Dêlo-ebè Bî was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Dêlo-ebè Bî lost 100 people, 302 livestock, and 30 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 221, when members of Dêlo-ebè Bî's militia enacted an operation to destroy or capture a specific enemy  general. The operation was complicated by the militia had access to far less resources than expected. The conflict ended with the defense of the depot against a siege, which ended in victory for Dêlo-ebè Bî's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Dêlo-ebè Bî's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

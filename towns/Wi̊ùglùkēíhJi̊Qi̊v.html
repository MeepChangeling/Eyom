<p>Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ˈwi̘ʊg/ /ˈlʊcɪ̞/ [victim; prey] [empty]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Qùkēi̊vRegion.html">Qùkēi̊v Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/DilysHolidayigqiz6z69m.html">Dilys Holiday</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 288 cm/y (113 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 188 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1788 m (5866 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1556, by Dilys Holiday. The establishment of Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Dilys Holiday struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are located arround a single broad baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's political statment focused walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. There’s a patern to the panic. It’s not easy to see, and no one quite agrees on what it is, but the locals know and operate under this pattern. It shapes everything they do, and you feel as if you’ve almost worked it out only for some small detail to devastate your theory every time you try and comprehend it.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v lost 164 people, 157 livestock, and 60 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 165, when members of Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the port, which ended in defeat for Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Wi̊ùglùkēíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

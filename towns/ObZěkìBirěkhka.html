<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka (/ob/ /ˈzɛcɨ/ [famous] [liver]) is a subtropical Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/MadraměvìDistrict.html">Madraměvì District</a> of the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ob Zěkì Birěkhka is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Ob Zěkì Birěkhka was founded by <a href="../people/ÈlêmGlênmêv6hdjd60j8g.html">Èlêm Glênmêv</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Ob Zěkì Birěkhka receives an average of 239 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ob Zěkì Birěkhka covers an area of nearly 7 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1842 m (6043 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1503, by Èlêm Glênmêv. The establishment of Ob Zěkì Birěkhka suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ob Zěkì Birěkhka is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious flagstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the town's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a town. The  town posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Ob Zěkì Birěkhka weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Ob Zěkì Birěkhka's budget focused millitary grade defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the town as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Ob Zěkì Birěkhka shows Ob Zěkì Birěkhka is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Ob Zěkì Birěkhka. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Ob Zěkì Birěkhka's parks.</p>

<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Ob Zěkì Birěkhka's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is long in Ob Zěkì Birěkhka.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Sylph.html">Sylph</a> near Ob Zěkì Birěkhka are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves drinking to channel Mysticism energies of tier 3 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Ob Zěkì Birěkhka was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Ob Zěkì Birěkhka was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ob Zěkì Birěkhka lost 264 people, 166 livestock, and 86 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 130, when members of Ob Zěkì Birěkhka's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular enemy powerful weapon intact. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Ob Zěkì Birěkhka's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in victory for Ob Zěkì Birěkhka's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ob Zěkì Birěkhka's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

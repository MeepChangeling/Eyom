<p>The name Croal Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Croal Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/AlbinoCaveSpidersNunnixyzz5q2y3.html">Albino Cave Spiders Nunn</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Croal Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Croal Citidel receives an average of 276 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Croal Citidel covers an area of nearly 76 km<sup>2</sup> (30 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2256 m (7401 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Croal Citidel was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1256, by Albino Cave Spiders Nunn. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Albino Cave Spiders Nunn.</p>
<p>Croal Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Croal Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Croal Citidel is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious canals streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Croal Citidel's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Croal Citidel hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Croal Citidel's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Croal Citidel every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

<p>Croal Citidel's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Invocation energies of tier 2 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Croal Citidel since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>Croal Citidel has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> solved a major long term problem plaguing the town. A small order of knights was founded in 's honor, and bears his name to this day.</p>

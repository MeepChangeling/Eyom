<p>Arrowe Castle (/arrowe/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QuiegsanRegion.html">Quiegsan Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Arrowe Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Arrowe Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Cúrmp̪f̄Jó̄ySugarZeniHärCō̄kīCä̋mBatchelorsukwzxfuwv.html">Cúrmp̪f̄ Jó̄y 'Sugar Zeni' Här Cō̄kī Cä̋m Batchelor</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Arrowe Castle has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Arrowe Castle receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Arrowe Castle covers an area of nearly 71 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5166 m (16948 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Arrowe Castle was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1373, by Cúrmp̪f̄ Jó̄y 'Sugar Zeni' Här Cō̄kī Cä̋m Batchelor. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Cúrmp̪f̄ Jó̄y 'Sugar Zeni' Här Cō̄kī Cä̋m Batchelor.</p>
<p>Arrowe Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Arrowe Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Arrowe Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Arrowe Castle's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Unfortuantly, these budget oriented are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Arrowe Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<p>Arrowe Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Arrowe Castle has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>
<p>Arrowe Castle is accessed from a nearby river via an intricate series of locks.</p>

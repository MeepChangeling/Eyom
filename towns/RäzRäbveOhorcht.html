<p>The name Räz Räbve Ohorcht is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Räbve Ohorcht was founded by <a href="../people/Jendethvrfwzk254q.html">Jendeth</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Räbve Ohorcht was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1531, by Jendeth. The establishment of Räz Räbve Ohorcht was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Jendeth struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Räz Räbve Ohorcht as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Räz Räbve Ohorcht was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Räbve Ohorcht is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Räbve Ohorcht is buildings are arranged arround a single spacious flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Räz Räbve Ohorcht's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Räz Räbve Ohorcht's unusual though effective defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Räz Räbve Ohorcht hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Räz Räbve Ohorcht is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

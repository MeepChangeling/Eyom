<p>Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ (/ˈmʊjʊ/ /ˈcɪːræ/ [slow; late] [wedding]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/S̺àûChyideKingdom.html">S̺àû Chyide Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/MîKûràEmpire.html">Mî Kûrà Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ was founded by <a href="../people/Laergulnith38fwyalwpi.html">Laergulnith</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F). Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ receives an average of 170 cm/y (66 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ covers an area of nearly 21 km<sup>2</sup> (8 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3694 m (12119 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1129, by Laergulnith. The establishment of Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ is buildings have been located at convienant points along the dale Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious worn bedrock streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ's political statment focused walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ lost 205 people, 278 livestock, and 59 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 187, when members of Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ's militia enacted an operation to locate a specific  expert. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Chyameya Mûyû Chyîræ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

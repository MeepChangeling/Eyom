<p>The name Iqî-êti Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Iqî-êti Îè was founded by Glelë, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Iqî-êti Îè has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 20°C (68°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F).

Iqî-êti Îè covers an area of nearly 275 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1058 m (3471 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Iqî-êti Îè was founded durring the early 16th century in fall of the year 1505, by Glelë. The establishment of Iqî-êti Îè suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Iqî-êti Îè which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Iqî-êti Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Iqî-êti Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brick construction taking the shape of large simple gemometric shapes which ate then embelished with decorative features, but retain their simple shapes in spite of the added features such as pillars, faccaddes, and covered walkways. The blocky nature gives a general impression of extreem age, as if each structure has existed since time immemorial.</p>
<p>Iqî-êti Îè is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive paverstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The cliffside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Iqî-êti Îè, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Iqî-êti Îè is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The law within Iqî-êti Îè is highly corrupt, or does not apply to certain favored groups or castes. Strangers might be fleeced by local lawmen, evildoers can be absolved by a payment, and powerful gentry do as they please.</p>
<p>Iqî-êti Îè's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Iqî-êti Îè.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Ramidreju.html">Ramidreju</a> near Iqî-êti Îè are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Iqî-êti Îè's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves gestures to channel Invocation energies of tier 1 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

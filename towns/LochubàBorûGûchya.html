<p>Lochubà Borû Gûchya (/loˈʧubə/ /ˈborʊ/ [sticky] [sugar]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/GeyuchiGuchâKingdom.html">Geyuchi Guchâ Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/Lu̽chiViyaEmpire.html">Lu̽chi Viya Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lochubà Borû Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lochubà Borû Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Dafyddslk7ih2jnp.html">Dafydd</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lochubà Borû Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 9°C (48°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -4°C (25°F). Lochubà Borû Gûchya receives an average of 162 cm/y (63 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Lochubà Borû Gûchya covers an area of nearly 97 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4272 m (14015 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lochubà Borû Gûchya was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1273, by Dafydd. The establishment of Lochubà Borû Gûchya  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Lochubà Borû Gûchya's construction back out of the project. Dafydd pushed on reguardles, and Lochubà Borû Gûchya was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Lochubà Borû Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lochubà Borû Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lochubà Borû Gûchya is buildings folow an organic layout of broad paverstone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Lochubà Borû Gûchya's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Lochubà Borû Gûchya's political statment focused walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Lochubà Borû Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lochubà Borû Gûchya long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Lochubà Borû Gûchya was attacked by savage scorpionfolks living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lochubà Borû Gûchya lost 198 people, 387 livestock, and 35 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 158, when members of Lochubà Borû Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to rescue a specific  hero from the enemy. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in victory for Lochubà Borû Gûchya's forces.

<p>The name I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Tsialmefyfzkjqrc4.html">Tsialme</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1097, by Tsialme. The establishment of I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow is buildings are arranged arround a single restrictive paverstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The millitarily questionable fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>I̽qüeëf Mën Hadfow's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>

<p>Qi̘v àfyèqùke (/ˈəfjɛ/ /ˈqʊke/ [descendant; offspring] [mustard]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/YèbgavCounty.html">Yèbgav County</a>, <a href="../provences/ShokeBarony.html">Shoke Barony</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v àfyèqùke is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v àfyèqùke was founded by <a href="../people/ShèbLilàbíhztdxvl1rup.html">Shèb Lilàbíh</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v àfyèqùke has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Qi̘v àfyèqùke receives an average of 134 cm/y (52 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qi̘v àfyèqùke covers an area of nearly 398 km<sup>2</sup> (159 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3736 m (12257 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v àfyèqùke was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1231, by Shèb Lilàbíh. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Shèb Lilàbíh.</p>
<p>Qi̘v àfyèqùke was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v àfyèqùke is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Qi̘v àfyèqùke is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious baked earthen streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Qi̘v àfyèqùke's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Qi̘v àfyèqùke's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Qi̘v àfyèqùke has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Qi̘v àfyèqùke ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Qi̘v àfyèqùke is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Qi̘v àfyèqùke long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qi̘v àfyèqùke's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Qi̘v àfyèqùke it is impossible to directly or indirectly lie.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

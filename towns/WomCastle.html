<p>Wom Castle (/wom/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/FieldbankDutchy.html">Fieldbank Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/BazanKingdom.html">Bazan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wom Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wom Castle was founded by <a href="../people/KthêlAcresa6cdfyvvwx.html">Kthêl Acres</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wom Castle has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Wom Castle receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Wom Castle covers an area of nearly 11 km<sup>2</sup> (4 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3140 m (10301 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wom Castle was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1284, by Kthêl Acres. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Wom Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wom Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wom Castle is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Wom Castle was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow paverstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Wom Castle's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Wom Castle has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Wom Castle ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Wom Castle is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Wom Castle long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wom Castle's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Wom Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>In Wom Castle there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\FleaGiant.html">Flea, Giant</a> near Wom Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Wom Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves performance art to channel Illusion energies of tier 1 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

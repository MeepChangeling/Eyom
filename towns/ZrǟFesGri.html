<p>Zrǟ Fes Gri (/zraː/ /fes/ [fair; just] [lion]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/IastrokbrukMoot.html">Iastrokbruk Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Zrǟ Fes Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Zrǟ Fes Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Vilwiela0s439fku3.html">Vilwiel</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zrǟ Fes Gri has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Zrǟ Fes Gri receives an average of 272 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Zrǟ Fes Gri covers an area of nearly 89 km<sup>2</sup> (35 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4762 m (15623 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zrǟ Fes Gri was founded durring the late 9th century, by Vilwiel. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Zrǟ Fes Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zrǟ Fes Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Zrǟ Fes Gri is buildings are arranged within a network of premissive flagstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Zrǟ Fes Gri's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Zrǟ Fes Gri's unusual though effective defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Zrǟ Fes Gri proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Zrǟ Fes Gri's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Zrǟ Fes Gri.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Almiraj.html">Almiraj</a> near Zrǟ Fes Gri are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Zrǟ Fes Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves reenactments to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 1 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Zrǟ Fes Gri was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Zrǟ Fes Gri. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Zrǟ Fes Gri lost 109 people, 337 livestock, and 26 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 93, when members of Zrǟ Fes Gri's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by the enemy forces had far more numbers than estimated. The conflict ended with the defense of the port against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Zrǟ Fes Gri's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Zrǟ Fes Gri's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>The name Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ was founded by Zoliod Wudush, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ covers an area of nearly 277 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2230 m (7316 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1081, by Zoliod Wudush. The establishment of Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠'s construction back out of the project. Zoliod Wudush pushed on reguardles, and Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The valley city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠'s mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠ lost 248 people, 290 livestock, and 85 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 45, when members of Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠'s militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular enemy war supplies. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠'s forces. The war is remembered in legend by Vrekön-hokfë Qo̠'s bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

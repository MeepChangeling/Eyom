<p>The name Beckala Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Beckala Castle was founded by <a href="../people/PeratineOgle3dj8nd267n.html">Peratine Ogle</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Beckala Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F).

Beckala Castle covers an area of nearly 128 km<sup>2</sup> (51 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4822 m (15820 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Beckala Castle was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1154, by Peratine Ogle. The establishment of Beckala Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Beckala Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Beckala Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Beckala Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow gravel streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Beckala Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Beckala Castle seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 1 years has greatly spiked Beckala Castle's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century several years of heavy rains culminated in a peculiar disaster. A great hole opened up beneath Beckala Castle, swallowing large sections of the community. Beckala Castle lost 270 people, 287 livestock, and 93 buildings in the disaster. This disaster is often refereed to as The Grieving Swallowing.</p>

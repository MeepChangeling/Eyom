<p>Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v (Krièv /ˈvutwə/ [trauma] [emotion]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MàvēvāvRegion.html">Màvēvāv Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Me917kwvfp2g.html">Me</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 231 cm/y (90 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 54 km<sup>2</sup> (21 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1560 m (5118 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1235, by Me. The establishment of Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Me electing to pay people to resettle in Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>
<p>Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow carved bedrock streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Krièvvutwà Ji̊ Qi̊v long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu (/nalf/ /ʤilt/ [wild] [sequence]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/DediimuRegion.html">Dediimu Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/ConfederationofGoblinTribes.html">Confederation of Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zräysian.html">Gnollish</a> language, as Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu was founded by <a href="../people/MlêbëvyimRolɑrtɑyutsɪxtr787ghhirb.html">Mlêbë vyim Rolɑrtɑyutsɪxt</a>, who was culturaly Gnollish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F).

Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1102 m (3615 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu was founded durring the late 16th century in winter of the year 1475, by Mlêbë vyim Rolɑrtɑyutsɪxt. The establishment of Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu's construction back out of the project. Mlêbë vyim Rolɑrtɑyutsɪxt pushed on reguardles, and Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu was built using the conventions of Gnollish durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu is is constructed  arround a series of spacious paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  town has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The town's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the town has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<p>Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sex to channel Necromancy energies of tier 3 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last (18228 % 6)+1 years has greatly spiked Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu lost 121 people, 338 livestock, and 98 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 57, when members of Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by a natural disaster interrupted the operation, shattering unit cohesion. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nalf-jilt Rudnoplu's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

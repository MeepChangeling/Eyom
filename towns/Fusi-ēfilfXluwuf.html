<p>Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf (/fuˈsi/ /æ̝ˈfilf/ [hard; solid; sturdy] [length]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/TemryontPrincipality.html">Temryont Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Soheque.html">Soheque</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Tresîc85hq93rpp.html">Tresî</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of -1°C (31°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm -25°C (-13°F). Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf receives an average of 265 cm/y (104 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 188 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2490 m (8169 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1427, by Tresî. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad baked earthen streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Astonishigly, the top tier civilian fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<p>Fusi-ēfilf Xluwuf's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

<p>The name Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw was founded by <a href="../people/GadshèdsmDyèdsíZlkdo81f0gzm8w6.html">Gadshèdsm Dyèdsí Zlkdo</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw receives an average of 272 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1434 m (4704 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1196, by Gadshèdsm Dyèdsí Zlkdo. The establishment of Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The town's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw's budget oriented are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the town as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Yú Boīlyǎer Bēä Nêōw possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> spared the town from an attack. A small order of knights was founded in 's honor, and bears his name to this day.</p>

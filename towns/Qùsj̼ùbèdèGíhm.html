<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm (/qʊs/ /j̼ʊˈbɛdɛ/ [lesson] [extinct]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ZåkräfRegion.html">Zåkräf Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Isaacmsa6u86rby.html">Isaac</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm receives an average of 239 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm covers an area of nearly 151 km<sup>2</sup> (60 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1956 m (6417 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm was founded durring the early 10th century, by Isaac. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Isaac.</p>
<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive baked earthen mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm’s streets. In spite of this, quite a few people can be seen reading and the city has an abundance of libraries. It’s quite clear the community values education.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Bogwid.html">Bogwid</a> near Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves reenactments to channel Abjuration energies of tier 2 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm was attacked by savage maftetss living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm lost 137 people, 259 livestock, and 91 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 120, when members of Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to deliver supplies to a specific group of civilians. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qùsj̼ùbèdè Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

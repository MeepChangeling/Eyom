<p>Demondale (/ˈdiːmən/ /deɪl/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/CourtcrestDutchy.html">Courtcrest Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DodbridCounty.html">Dodbrid County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Demondale is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Demondale was founded by Kthêbê Whiting, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Demondale has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Demondale receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Demondale covers an area of nearly 541 km<sup>2</sup> (216 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4896 m (16062 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Demondale was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1195, by Kthêbê Whiting. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Kthêbê Whiting.</p>
<p>Demondale was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Demondale is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Demondale is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of narrow flagstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The cliffside city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Demondale's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Demondale shows Demondale is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is.</p>

<p>Demondale has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Demondale's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Demondale all of the cats speak the local language with prefect diction.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Demondale is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> slew a monster which had been terrorizing the streets of Demondale. Demondale created a local delicacy in 's honor which is served at festivals.</p>

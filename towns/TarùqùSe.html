<p>Tarùqù Se (/tar/ /ˈʊqʊ/ [homeland; motherland] [premier]) is a subtropical Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/LuvjashCounty.html">Luvjash County</a> of the <a href="../nations/PichamCommunity.html">Picham Community</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tarùqù Se is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Tarùqù Se was founded by <a href="../people/HywelCadwaladrCadward1g52k9yx2z.html">Hywel Cadwaladr Cadward</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tarùqù Se has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Tarùqù Se receives an average of 217 cm/y (85 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Tarùqù Se covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2724 m (8937 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tarùqù Se was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1222, by Hywel Cadwaladr Cadward. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tarùqù Se is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se is was constructed arround several premissive split-log ties mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Tarùqù Se's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Tarùqù Se's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Tarùqù Se hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Tarùqù Se is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Tarùqù Se has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Tarùqù Se. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Tarùqù Se's parks.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Tarùqù Se.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Tarùqù Se's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Tarùqù Se's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Tarùqù Se's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Tarùqù Se the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Keulia.html">Keulia</a> near Tarùqù Se are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Tarùqù Se's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves ritual combat to channel Necromancy energies of tier 3 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Tarùqù Se is known for its well built pedestrian paths, which include foot bridges to cross the main street at several high-traffic areas.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last (3561 % 6)+1 years has greatly spiked Tarùqù Se's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami ended a famine plaguing Tarùqù Se. One of Tarùqù Se's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

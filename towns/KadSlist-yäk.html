<p>The name Kad Slist-yäk is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Slist-yäk was founded by <a href="../people/Grraegrurthvk19wqnlpz.html">Grraegrurth</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Slist-yäk has a yearly average temperature of 6°C (42°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 2°C (35°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F).

Kad Slist-yäk covers an area of nearly 103 km<sup>2</sup> (41 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4542 m (14901 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Slist-yäk was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1256, by Grraegrurth. The establishment of Kad Slist-yäk was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Grraegrurth struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Kad Slist-yäk as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Kad Slist-yäk was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Slist-yäk is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kad Slist-yäk is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt flagstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Unfortuantly, these failry decent fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Slist-yäk gives you a feeling of distrust and paranoia. Also greed. The locals seem to be very much into scholastic pursuits, based on the hushed, murmured conversations you hear at least.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Kad Slist-yäk is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>

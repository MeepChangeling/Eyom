<p>Boyû Himî Kâchyâ (/ˈbojʊ/ /ˈhimɪː/ [thin (slender); slim] [building]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BædàdâLu̹vûKingdom.html">Bædàdâ Lu̹vû Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/Lu̽chiViyaEmpire.html">Lu̽chi Viya Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boyû Himî Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boyû Himî Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Rhunq3cwmnh6li.html">Rhun</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boyû Himî Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -8°C (18°F). Boyû Himî Kâchyâ receives an average of 104 cm/y (40 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Boyû Himî Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5716 m (18753 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boyû Himî Kâchyâ was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1353, by Rhun. The establishment of Boyû Himî Kâchyâ was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Rhun electing to pay people to resettle in Boyû Himî Kâchyâ.</p>
<p>Boyû Himî Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boyû Himî Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Boyû Himî Kâchyâ is buildings are located arround a single restrictive paverstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Boyû Himî Kâchyâ's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Astonishigly, the budget oriented are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Boyû Himî Kâchyâ is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Boyû Himî Kâchyâ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boyû Himî Kâchyâ lost 116 people, 314 livestock, and 45 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 39, when members of Boyû Himî Kâchyâ's militia enacted an operation to train a group of civilians for a special clandestine operation. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with the defense of the depot against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Boyû Himî Kâchyâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Boyû Himî Kâchyâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf was founded durring the late 11th century, by Cyih. The establishment of Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt split-log ties streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Astonishigly, the unusual though effective defenses are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Uhotága-zmeké̄rghurv Xluwuf the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>

<p>Warmouth (/wɔː/ /maʊθ/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/LinmeadDutchy.html">Linmead Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DodbridCounty.html">Dodbrid County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Warmouth is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Warmouth was founded by <a href="../people/DarlaAustinr90awvkfx5.html">Darla Austin</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Warmouth has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Warmouth receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Warmouth covers an area of nearly 335 km<sup>2</sup> (134 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5318 m (17447 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Warmouth was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1149, by Darla Austin. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Warmouth was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Warmouth is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Warmouth is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive paverstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The city's robustly designed timber walls have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Warmouth seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Warmouth the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Warmouth possesses a <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> for its accademic, government, and financial institutions. Public Aethary access is available through one or more of these intitutions.</p>

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Warmouth has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Warmouth's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Warmouth has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Warmouth has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>

<p>Warmouth is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Warmouth's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is skipped in Warmouth.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿SnakeVenomous.html">﻿Snake, Venomous</a> near Warmouth are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Warmouth's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves drinking to channel Abjuration energies of tier 1 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Warmouth has a conflict with a neighboring community. This usually isn't part of a larger war, but is instead a personal animosity between them. It may be the community has suffered at their enemy's hands, or they may have been the ones applying the suffering. Constant low-level skirmishes and trouble making go on between the two.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Warmouth is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

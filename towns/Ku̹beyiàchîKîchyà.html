<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  (/mʊˈkɑjʊ/ /ˈəʧɪː/ [rugged] [stable]) is a temperate Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/LakâKâziPrincipality.html">Lakâ Kâzi Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/City-stateofKakoray.html">City-state of Kakoray</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  is derived from the <a href="../languages/S̺uran.html">Wareneese</a> language, as Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  was founded by <a href="../people/GrèsëdFyesheg̈8stijsyj2c.html">Grèsëd Fyesheg̈</a>, who was culturaly Wareneese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm -11°C (13°F). Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  receives an average of 229 cm/y (90 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  covers an area of nearly 7 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4802 m (15754 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1113, by Grèsëd Fyesheg̈. The establishment of Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  was built using the conventions of Wareneese durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  is buildings are arranged arround a single spacious gravel mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the town a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà 's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà . They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà 's parks.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà .</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà 's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà 's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà 's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà .</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿GuardianDoll.html">﻿Guardian Doll</a> near Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà  are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà 's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves orgies to channel Invocation energies of tier 1 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà 's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ku̹beyi àchî Kîchyà 's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

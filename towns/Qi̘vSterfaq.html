<p>Qi̘v Sterfaq (Ster /faq/ [Propername] [lock]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/KùjvātCounty.html">Kùjvāt County</a>, <a href="../provences/BotburyShire.html">Botbury Shire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Sterfaq is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Sterfaq was founded by <a href="../people/NitsNashnb7fk78c0d.html">Nits Nash</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Sterfaq has a yearly average temperature of 30°C (86°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Qi̘v Sterfaq receives an average of 277 cm/y (109 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qi̘v Sterfaq covers an area of nearly 396 km<sup>2</sup> (158 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1678 m (5505 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Sterfaq was founded durring the late 19th century in early summer of the year 1860, by Nits Nash. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Sterfaq was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 19th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Sterfaq is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature stone brick construction with most buildings posessing towers, turrets, dormers, and wide wrap-around porches. An extreem emphasis on decorative features and emblishments can be seen even on the poorest of homes and makes even the most humble of structures seem a bit regal.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Sterfaq is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious gravel streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Qi̘v Sterfaq's millitarily questionable fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Sterfaq has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Qi̘v Sterfaq’s streets.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Qi̘v Sterfaq was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qi̘v Sterfaq lost 133 people, 291 livestock, and 50 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 206, when members of Qi̘v Sterfaq's militia enacted an operation to capture a specific enemy 's family member alive. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Qi̘v Sterfaq's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qi̘v Sterfaq's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Räz Ehz Oldz (/ɪ̘z/ /oldz/ [most] [scope; extent]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SehimesocuHold.html">Sehimesocu Hold</a>, <a href="../provences/SipugehiveKingdom.html">Sipugehive Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Undermountain.html">Undermountain</a>.</p>
<p>The name Räz Ehz Oldz is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Ehz Oldz was founded by <a href="../people/Mathliba3l4amw5g.html">Mathli</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Räz Ehz Oldz has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Räz Ehz Oldz receives an average of 155 cm/y (61 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Räz Ehz Oldz covers an area of nearly 78 km<sup>2</sup> (31 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7012 m (-19944 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Ehz Oldz was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1386, by Mathli. The establishment of Räz Ehz Oldz  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Räz Ehz Oldz's construction back out of the project. Mathli pushed on reguardles, and Räz Ehz Oldz was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Räz Ehz Oldz was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Ehz Oldz is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Ehz Oldz is is constructed arround a semi-circular spacious packed earth mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Unfortuantly, these Ragnarock-era relics are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Räz Ehz Oldz might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Räz Ehz Oldz's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by grandeur of scale, simplicity of geometric forms, dramatic use of columns, and a preference for blank walls. This design ethos extended to re-imagining earlier styles of structure to create them anew, with a similar overall look and feel to one another..</p>
<p>In Räz Ehz Oldz rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Dvorovoi.html">Dvorovoi</a> near Räz Ehz Oldz are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Räz Ehz Oldz's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves consuming a local narcotic to channel Invocation energies of tier 2 via mimery.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

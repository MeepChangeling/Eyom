<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Bollo was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1150, by Réń Vúrmër 'Ryan Chloe' Yä̂f̄sh Sër Vú̄boīy Shepard. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Réń Vúrmër 'Ryan Chloe' Yä̂f̄sh Sër Vú̄boīy Shepard.</p>
<p>Fort Bollo was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Bollo is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fort Bollo is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt paverstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Fort Bollo's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Fort Bollo makes you wonder how anything ever gets done. The locals have clear, obvious rivalries with one another, as seen through clenched teeth and fake smiles.

The city seems to be a den of chaos where tongues are forked and local customs do not exist.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fort Bollo's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Fort Bollo.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tast Prävju-mi Xluwuf was founded durring the early 11th century, by Shelëd. The establishment of Tast Prävju-mi Xluwuf suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Tast Prävju-mi Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tast Prävju-mi Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Tast Prävju-mi Xluwuf is buildings folow an organic layout of spacious worn bedrock streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Tast Prävju-mi Xluwuf's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Tast Prävju-mi Xluwuf's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Tast Prävju-mi Xluwuf is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>

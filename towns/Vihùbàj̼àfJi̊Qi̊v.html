<p>Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ˈvihʊ/ /ˈbəj̼əf/ [altitude] [offensive]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SíhvquluRegion.html">Síhvqulu Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Tsmeshh838accwnx.html">Tsmesh</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 141 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 203 km<sup>2</sup> (81 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4616 m (15144 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 17th century in late spring of the year 1578, by Tsmesh. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Tsmesh.</p>
<p>Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is long in Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>

<p>Vihùbàj̼àf Ji̊ Qi̊v's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves creating small tokens to channel Augury energies of tier 1 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

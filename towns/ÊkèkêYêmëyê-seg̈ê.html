<p>The name Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê was founded by <a href="../people/Alcelamorpha40y8vwvcx8.html">Alcelamorpha</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê has a yearly average temperature of 31°C (87°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 36°C (96°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê receives an average of 66 cm/y (25 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê covers an area of nearly 235 km<sup>2</sup> (94 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 12884 m (-679 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê was founded durring the late 16th century in summer of the year 1469, by Alcelamorpha. The establishment of Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Alcelamorpha struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê's failry decent fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a great windstorm struck Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê. Its winds were so great they picked up unsecured objects and flung them with enough force to smash brick and skull alike. Buildings collapsed under the gale, burying countless people alive. The storm's devistation was focused on the area arround Êkèkê Yêmëyê-seg̈ê, which lost 145 people, 360, and 39 livestock in the disaster.. History remembers the strom as The Storm of Grieving.</p>

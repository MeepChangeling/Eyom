<p>Lisgrove (/liːz/ /grəʊv/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/WesterburnDutchy.html">Westerburn Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/SoroughCounty.html">Sorough County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lisgrove is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lisgrove was founded by Mathli Haynes, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lisgrove has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Lisgrove receives an average of 242 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Lisgrove covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2130 m (6988 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lisgrove was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1458, by Mathli Haynes. The establishment of Lisgrove  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Lisgrove's construction back out of the project. Mathli Haynes pushed on reguardles, and Lisgrove was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Lisgrove was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lisgrove is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lisgrove is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious packed earth streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Lisgrove, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Lisgrove has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lisgrove long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lisgrove's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Lisgrove rainbows form quite often above the Large City.</p>

<p>Lisgrove's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 1 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Lisgrove is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Lisgrove is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Lisgrove was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lisgrove lost 244 people, 116 livestock, and 64 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 56, when members of Lisgrove's militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular enemy war supplies. The operation was complicated by a natural disaster interrupted the operation, shattering unit cohesion. The conflict ended with the defense of the bridge against a siege, which ended in defeat for Lisgrove's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lisgrove's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

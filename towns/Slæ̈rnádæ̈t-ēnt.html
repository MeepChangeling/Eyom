<p>Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt (/ə˞ˈdæ̝t/ /æ̝nt/ [greedy] [hope]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GïtarejéPrincipality.html">Gïtarejé Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Nasdi.html">Nasdi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt was founded by <a href="../people/Chrish068kd8yfp.html">Chris</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt has a yearly average temperature of -1°C (31°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -24°C (-11°F). Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt receives an average of 249 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3668 m (12034 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1340, by Chris. The establishment of Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt's construction back out of the project. Chris pushed on reguardles, and Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow canals streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt’s streets. In spite of this, quite a few people can be seen reading and the city has an abundance of libraries. It’s quite clear the community values education.</p>

It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile.

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century an up-welling of water from beneath the earth caused Brook Marin to surge and overflow its banks. The resulting flood was isolated to the area around Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt, which was swallowed by the waters for several days. Slæ̈rn ádæ̈t-ēnt lost 113 people, 115 livestock, and 64 buildings in the disaster. The disaster is remembered as the Horror Drownings.</p>

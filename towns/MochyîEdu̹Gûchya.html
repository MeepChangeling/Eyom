<p>Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya (/ˈmocɪː/ /ˈedu̹/ [polite] [width; diameter]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/GlikérádPrincipality.html">Glikérád Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Saborri.html">Saborri</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Ůwditsagggvkyafv.html">Ůwdits</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -17°C (2°F). Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya receives an average of 263 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya covers an area of nearly 40 km<sup>2</sup> (16 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2894 m (9494 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya was founded durring the early 11th century, by Ůwdits. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ůwdits.</p>
<p>Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya is is constructed arround a semi-circular spacious split-log ties mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya's cost-cutting-focused defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is skipped in Mochyî Edu̹ Gûchya.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/TrgfèjDyêmTrînhëdkt4srisal.html">Trgfèj Dyêm Trînhë</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1195, by Trgfèj Dyêm Trînhë. The establishment of Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are speckled and packed arround premissive paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä’s streets. Yet, deep down, you know this atmosphere is a carefully created illusion. You can see the ocasional seam in their tapestry. You’re not sure what has them doing their best to act so carefree, but act carefree they do.</p>

Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>
<p>Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä is accessed from a nearby river via an intricate series of locks.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä lost 228 people, 366 livestock, and 20 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 60, when members of Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular enemy powerful weapon. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with the defense of the strategic location against a siege, which ended in defeat for Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Yë̋tḩ Maw̌y Ni̋ēkēä's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

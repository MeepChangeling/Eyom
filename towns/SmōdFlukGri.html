<p>The name Smōd Fluk Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Smōd Fluk Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Onvuc4wia5y72j2.html">Onvuc</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Smōd Fluk Gri has a yearly average temperature of 0°C (32°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -25°C (-13°F). Smōd Fluk Gri receives an average of 293 cm/y (115 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Smōd Fluk Gri covers an area of nearly 49 km<sup>2</sup> (19 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3056 m (10026 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Smōd Fluk Gri was founded durring the early 16th century in fall of the year 1550, by Onvuc. The establishment of Smōd Fluk Gri suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Smōd Fluk Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Smōd Fluk Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Smōd Fluk Gri is is constructed  arround a series of broad cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Smōd Fluk Gri has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Smōd Fluk Gri long.</p>

<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Smōd Fluk Gri hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with.

<p>Smōd Fluk Gri's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<p>Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm (Kstopsv /ˈvɛvdə/ [beetle] [vehicle]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ZåkräfRegion.html">Zåkräf Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Dastrohildezfjkfmclgj.html">Dastrohilde</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm receives an average of 209 cm/y (82 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm covers an area of nearly 133 km<sup>2</sup> (53 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3854 m (12644 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1486, by Dastrohilde. The establishment of Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive gravel streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Kstopsvvèvdà Gíhm all of the cats speak the local language with prefect diction.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job.

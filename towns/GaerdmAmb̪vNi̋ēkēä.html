<p>Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä (/wɑ̄/ /ɑɱb̪v/ [recent] [anger]) is a subtropical Small City located in the <a href="../provences/BāwkyoīäProvence.html">Bāwkyoīä Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/DhoghirthOthyrGrahrru4qv2a80j.html">Dhoghirth Othyr Grahr</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 271 cm/y (106 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 17 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3090 m (10137 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1450, by Dhoghirth Othyr Grahr. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Dhoghirth Othyr Grahr.</p>
<p>Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive gravel mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with. This hate may spring from recent events, or it may be an inherited spite from old wrongs.</p>
<p>Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä it is impossible to directly or indirectly lie.</p>

<p>Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves reenactments to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 1 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä lost 189 people, 191 livestock, and 55 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 108, when members of Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about a particular production site. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with the defense of the production site against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Gaerdm Amb̪v Ni̋ēkēä's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Camnagar (/kæm/ /nagar/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/DunscastEarldom.html">Dunscast Earldom</a> of the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Camnagar is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Camnagar was founded by <a href="../people/Ma̋chvé̄ErméchXandySashaCa̋mé̄Mé̄yYa̋mēCulverwtmm7y9h55.html">Ma̋chvé̄ Erméch 'Xandy Sasha' Ca̋mé̄ Mé̄y Ya̋mē Culver</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Camnagar has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Camnagar receives an average of 240 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Camnagar covers an area of nearly 480 km<sup>2</sup> (192 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 976 m (3202 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Camnagar was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1094, by Ma̋chvé̄ Erméch 'Xandy Sasha' Ca̋mé̄ Mé̄y Ya̋mē Culver. The establishment of Camnagar suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Camnagar which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Camnagar was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Camnagar is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Camnagar is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Camnagar's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Unfortuantly, these boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Looking around Camnagar you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>A substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign settlement conquered within the relatively recent past. The locals may not be enthusiastic about being ruled by others not of their kind, and their neighbors may look askance at the way foreign customs or even laws may be maintained.</p>
<p>Camnagar's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Camnagar there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\CicadaSwarm.html">Cicada Swarm</a> near Camnagar are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Camnagar's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Invocation energies of tier 2 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Räz äncwe Dÿhl (/ənˈkwi/ /dɪ̘l/ [angry; mad] [discount]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HatupujuqeProvence.html">Hatupujuqe Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Räz äncwe Dÿhl is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz äncwe Dÿhl was founded by <a href="../people/Trèqtêyë5pmw4ytzh2.html">Trèqtêyë</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Räz äncwe Dÿhl has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Räz äncwe Dÿhl receives an average of 144 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Räz äncwe Dÿhl covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6458 m (21187 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz äncwe Dÿhl was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1279, by Trèqtêyë. The establishment of Räz äncwe Dÿhl suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Räz äncwe Dÿhl was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz äncwe Dÿhl is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz äncwe Dÿhl is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Räz äncwe Dÿhl's millitarily questionable fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Räz äncwe Dÿhl is like a look into a broken heart. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need. It’s not malicious. Heads are hung. Eyes are empty. Something truly horrible happened here once upon a time and the city never healed.</p>

<p>Räz äncwe Dÿhl's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

<p>Nailbourne Castle (/nailbourne/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/WyvernfordDutchy.html">Wyvernford Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/QueoulniaKingdom.html">Queoulnia Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nailbourne Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nailbourne Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Fyesheg̈Houchen4wpwbb0shq.html">Fyesheg̈ Houchen</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nailbourne Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Nailbourne Castle receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Nailbourne Castle covers an area of nearly 15 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4706 m (15439 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nailbourne Castle was founded durring the late 11th century, by Fyesheg̈ Houchen. The establishment of Nailbourne Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Nailbourne Castle's construction back out of the project. Fyesheg̈ Houchen pushed on reguardles, and Nailbourne Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Nailbourne Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nailbourne Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nailbourne Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of broad cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Nailbourne Castle's cost-cutting-focused defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Nailbourne Castle has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Nailbourne Castle suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Nailbourne Castle long.</p>

Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Nailbourne Castle is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Nailbourne Castle is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami spared the town a natural disaster. One of Nailbourne Castle's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

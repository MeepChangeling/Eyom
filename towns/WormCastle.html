<p>Worm Castle (/wɜrm/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WeianRegion.html">Weian Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Worm Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Worm Castle was founded by <a href="../people/HouseCentipedesCravenkiznqn51mp.html">House Centipedes Craven</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Worm Castle has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 18°C (64°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Worm Castle receives an average of 240 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Worm Castle covers an area of nearly 90 km<sup>2</sup> (36 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2098 m (6883 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Worm Castle was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1252, by House Centipedes Craven. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for House Centipedes Craven.</p>
<p>Worm Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Worm Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Worm Castle is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Worm Castle's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Astonishigly, the top tier civilian fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Worm Castle is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Worm Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is long in Worm Castle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Almiraj.html">Almiraj</a> near Worm Castle are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Worm Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves reenactments to channel Abjuration energies of tier 2 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Worm Castle’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Worm Castle’s streets.</p>

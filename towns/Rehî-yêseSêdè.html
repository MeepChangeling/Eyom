<p>The name Rehî-yêse Sêdè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Rehî-yêse Sêdè was founded by <a href="../people/Mlelir832rqizz5.html">Mleli</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Rehî-yêse Sêdè has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Rehî-yêse Sêdè receives an average of 131 cm/y (51 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Rehî-yêse Sêdè covers an area of nearly 149 km<sup>2</sup> (59 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5662 m (18576 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rehî-yêse Sêdè was founded durring the early 18th century in late winter of the year 1726, by Mleli. The establishment of Rehî-yêse Sêdè suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Rehî-yêse Sêdè which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Rehî-yêse Sêdè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rehî-yêse Sêdè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Rehî-yêse Sêdè is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt paverstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these cost-cutting-focused defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Rehî-yêse Sêdè seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Rehî-yêse Sêdè the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Rehî-yêse Sêdè's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Rehî-yêse Sêdè was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Rehî-yêse Sêdè lost 246 people, 392 livestock, and 31 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 60, when members of Rehî-yêse Sêdè's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the port, which ended in defeat for Rehî-yêse Sêdè's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Rehî-yêse Sêdè's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

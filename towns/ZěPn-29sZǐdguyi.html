<p>The name Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi was founded by Trèdshê Dyëmëmê, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1419, by Trèdshê Dyëmëmê. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Trèdshê Dyëmëmê.</p>
<p>Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The valley city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Zě Pn-29s Zǐdguyi's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

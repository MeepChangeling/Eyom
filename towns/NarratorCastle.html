<p>Narrator Castle (/ˈnɛreɪtər/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Narrator Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Narrator Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ZêyêNewboldpshaq0j0ml.html">Zêyê Newbold</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Narrator Castle has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 18°C (64°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Narrator Castle receives an average of 240 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Narrator Castle covers an area of nearly 10 km<sup>2</sup> (4 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1388 m (4553 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Narrator Castle was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1337, by Zêyê Newbold. The establishment of Narrator Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Narrator Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Narrator Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Narrator Castle is buildings have been located at convienant points along the mountain Narrator Castle was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the broad cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Narrator Castle's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Narrator Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Narrator Castle has access to some sort of functioning ancient infrastructure, whether it's an array of wall-mounted arcane energy projectors, running water, moving roadways, community-wide climate control, or some other inherited luxury. This infrastructure may be the result of a still-functional Working, or it could be the product of some venerable occult engine that's still operational, or it may be the fruit of the labors of some specially-designed organism or Blighted populace.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Narrator Castle is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami spared the town from an attack. One of Narrator Castle's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<p>Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä (/gûːθ/ /ɹɑ/ [sharp; acute] [Footjob]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FǎshfoīyRegion.html">Fǎshfoīy Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/GrilîBrelêMlelelên5vbv5yxmz.html">Grilî Brelê Mlelelê</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 1°C (33°F). Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 300 cm/y (118 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 59 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3806 m (12486 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1227, by Grilî Brelê Mlelelê. The establishment of Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä's construction back out of the project. Grilî Brelê Mlelelê pushed on reguardles, and Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a single premissive flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä's top tier civilian fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Gû̄tḩ Ra Ni̋ēkēä since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>

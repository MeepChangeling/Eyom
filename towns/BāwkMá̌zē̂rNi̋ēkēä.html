<p>The name Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/RērMa̋mbónḱHollyShayBé̄̄kīyRéchVúchīkīMä̌shHa̋mévipztbmsts.html">Rēr Ma̋mbónḱ 'Holly Shay' Bé̄̄kīy Réch Vúchīkī Mä̌sh Ha̋mé</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2530 m (8300 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 11th century, by Rēr Ma̋mbónḱ 'Holly Shay' Bé̄̄kīy Réch Vúchīkī Mä̌sh Ha̋mé. The establishment of Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Rēr Ma̋mbónḱ 'Holly Shay' Bé̄̄kīy Réch Vúchīkī Mä̌sh Ha̋mé struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Bāwk Má̌zē̂r Ni̋ēkēä ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>

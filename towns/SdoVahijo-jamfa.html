<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Sdo Vahijo-jamfa used to be much richer, but something happened in the last (23605 % 6)+1 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Sdo Vahijo-jamfa was attacked by a group of nobles with their private armies. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Sdo Vahijo-jamfa lost 174 people, 299 livestock, and 46 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 142, when members of Sdo Vahijo-jamfa's militia enacted an operation to construct defenses in a particular bridge. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Sdo Vahijo-jamfa's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in victory for Sdo Vahijo-jamfa's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Sdo Vahijo-jamfa's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

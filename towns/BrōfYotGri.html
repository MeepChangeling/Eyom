<p>Brōf Yot Gri (/broːf/ /jot/ [distinct; apparent; unique] [widow]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/ḾoůmaH́ueo̊Moot.html">Ḿoůma H́ueo̊ Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Brōf Yot Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Brōf Yot Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Tshëcupstp7n5q.html">Tshë</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Brōf Yot Gri has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Brōf Yot Gri receives an average of 260 cm/y (102 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Brōf Yot Gri covers an area of nearly 46 km<sup>2</sup> (18 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2434 m (7985 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Brōf Yot Gri was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1426, by Tshë. The establishment of Brōf Yot Gri was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Tshë electing to pay people to resettle in Brōf Yot Gri.</p>
<p>Brōf Yot Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Brōf Yot Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Brōf Yot Gri is is constructed  arround a series of spacious baked earthen mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Brōf Yot Gri weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Unfortuantly, these budget focused millitary grade defenses are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Brōf Yot Gri has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Brōf Yot Gri long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Brōf Yot Gri is home to a distinct subculture, who are either the majority here or have the dominant positions in the community. Architecture, local laws, and social customs are all tuned to suit them, and they may not be particularly forgiving or friendly to the major culture of the region. Communities that are not outright independent usually make an arm's-length submission to a local lord.</p>
<p>Brōf Yot Gri's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Brōf Yot Gri.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\AmoebaGiant.html">Amoeba, Giant</a> near Brōf Yot Gri are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Brōf Yot Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves orgies to channel Augury energies of tier 1 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

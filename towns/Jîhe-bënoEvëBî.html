<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî (/ˈʤɪhe/ /ˈbëno ˈevë/ [opposite] [copyright]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/QíîsîrêyêSêpíêtoZone.html">Qíîsîrêyê Sêpíêto Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî was founded by <a href="../people/Byog̈iliGareshdt1df3ptrh.html">Byog̈ili Garesh</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1494 m (4901 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1190, by Byog̈ili Garesh. The establishment of Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî's construction back out of the project. Byog̈ili Garesh pushed on reguardles, and Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the town's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a town. The  town is protected by a well-crafted cobblestone fence tall enough to provide adiquite cover for defenders to fire from, but no more than that. The frontieer-style defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the town has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî.

<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\BegedhiParasite.html">Begedhi, Parasite</a> near Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves square dance to channel Invocation energies of tier 3 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Jîhe-bëno Evë Bî makes use of canals for some of its streets. Locals often fish in the canals.</p>

<p>The name Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Tsåtsu8y0k9kkhl.html">Tsåts</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 172 km<sup>2</sup> (68 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4696 m (15406 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1186, by Tsåts. The establishment of Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are speckled and packed arround restrictive gravel streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lèmqohi Ji̊ Qi̊v long.</p>

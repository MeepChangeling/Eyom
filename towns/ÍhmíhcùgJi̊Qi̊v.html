<p>The name Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Trîpí2lbv7kugls.html">Trîpí</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 84 km<sup>2</sup> (33 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2126 m (6975 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1432, by Trîpí. The establishment of Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v is is constructed arround a semi-circular restrictive flagstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Astonishigly, the monster and outlaw focused fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Ekk Yènvil Fields was struck by a drought when Loch Stowe grew too small to continue feeding River Adva, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Íhmíhcùg Ji̊ Qi̊v lost 211 people, and 223 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 6 weeks, which are remembered as the Grieving Thirst.</p>

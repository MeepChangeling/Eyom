<p>Killcester (/killcester/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/Dilengzgaz̄upuParish.html">Dilengzgaz̄upu Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/UldanCounty.html">Uldan County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Killcester is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Killcester was founded by <a href="../people/TaradTsèdoGlkdsmëJacksongf06kx0iqh.html">Tarad Tsèdo Glkdsmë Jackson</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Killcester has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Killcester receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Killcester covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6946 m (-20160 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Killcester was founded durring the early 10th century, by Tarad Tsèdo Glkdsmë Jackson. The establishment of Killcester suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Killcester was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Killcester is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Killcester is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  town rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The town's millitarily questionable fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Killcester hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the town has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Killcester has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Killcester.</p>

<p>Killcester has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Killcester's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Killcester's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>
<p>In Killcester rainbows form quite often above the Town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\BloodBush.html">Blood Bush</a> near Killcester are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Killcester's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves drinking to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 3 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Killcester's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Killcester suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Killcester used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Killcester.</p>

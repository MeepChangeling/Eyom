<p>The name Ngītäm Ga̋wprá̂er Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ngītäm Ga̋wprá̂er Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/ZênkaÊbrg̈gfëZlêyëmhr99dmpskw.html">Zênka Êbrg̈gfë Zlêyëm</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ngītäm Ga̋wprá̂er Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1412, by Zênka Êbrg̈gfë Zlêyëm. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Zênka Êbrg̈gfë Zlêyëm.</p>
<p>Ngītäm Ga̋wprá̂er Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ngītäm Ga̋wprá̂er Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Ngītäm Ga̋wprá̂er Ni̋ēkēä is was constructed arround several narrow packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Ngītäm Ga̋wprá̂er Ni̋ēkēä's millitarily questionable fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ngītäm Ga̋wprá̂er Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

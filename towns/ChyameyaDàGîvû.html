<p>Chyameya Dà Gîvû (/ˈosɑ/ /ˈgɪːvʊ/ [mauve] [horizon; panorama]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Temmī̄fPrincipality.html">Temmī̄f Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Lallalo.html">Lallalo</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chyameya Dà Gîvû is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Dà Gîvû was founded by <a href="../people/Lucthelc53pfrx3c6.html">Lucthel</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyameya Dà Gîvû has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -17°C (2°F). Chyameya Dà Gîvû receives an average of 186 cm/y (73 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Chyameya Dà Gîvû covers an area of nearly 189 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4424 m (14514 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Dà Gîvû was founded in time immemorial, reportedly some time durring the late 7th century, by Lucthel. The establishment of Chyameya Dà Gîvû  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Chyameya Dà Gîvû's construction back out of the project. Lucthel pushed on reguardles, and Chyameya Dà Gîvû was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Chyameya Dà Gîvû was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 7th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Dà Gîvû is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Dà Gîvû is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt flagstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Chyameya Dà Gîvû has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Chyameya Dà Gîvû long.</p>

<p>The name Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Grothnah43g4x7pbfv.html">Grothnah</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 101 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5190 m (17027 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1544, by Grothnah. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Grothnah.</p>
<p>Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ is was constructed arround several spacious worn bedrock mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Àchi Hûchyâgà Kâchyâ is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

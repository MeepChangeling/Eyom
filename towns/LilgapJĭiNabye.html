<p>Lilgap Jĭi Nabye (/ʤi/ /ˈnabje/ [social] [princess]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/TuksuproneheZone.html">Tuksupronehe Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/SktkrmmepoDistrict.html">Sktkrmmepo District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Alveria.html">Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lilgap Jĭi Nabye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lilgap Jĭi Nabye was founded by <a href="../people/Vw-69qV.I.C.I.wdq3py8q0g.html">Vw-69q 'V.I.C.I.'</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lilgap Jĭi Nabye has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Lilgap Jĭi Nabye receives an average of 92 cm/y (36 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lilgap Jĭi Nabye covers an area of nearly 89 km<sup>2</sup> (35 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6524 m (21404 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lilgap Jĭi Nabye was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1095, by Vw-69q 'V.I.C.I.'. The establishment of Lilgap Jĭi Nabye  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Lilgap Jĭi Nabye's construction back out of the project. Vw-69q 'V.I.C.I.' pushed on reguardles, and Lilgap Jĭi Nabye was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Lilgap Jĭi Nabye was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilgap Jĭi Nabye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Lilgap Jĭi Nabye is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt cobblestone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Lilgap Jĭi Nabye's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Lilgap Jĭi Nabye's budget oriented are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Lilgap Jĭi Nabye is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Lilgap Jĭi Nabye has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>

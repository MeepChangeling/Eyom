<p>The name Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Úllothnethpta4ca1vsc.html">Úllothneth</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 45 km<sup>2</sup> (18 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1440 m (4724 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 18th century in early summer of the year 1711, by Úllothneth. The establishment of Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ is buildings are speckled and packed arround broad cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Boyû S̺e Kâchyâ is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

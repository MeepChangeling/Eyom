<p>Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ (/q˔ik/ /ˈrəha/ [aroused (sexually)] [trousers; pants]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HetaheriaProvince.html">Hetaheria Province</a> of the <a href="../nations/LallalanCity-state.html">Lallalan City-state</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ was founded by <a href="../people/Randrenur2ppjszin.html">Randren</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -14°C (7°F). Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ receives an average of 195 cm/y (76 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ covers an area of nearly 328 km<sup>2</sup> (131 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6480 m (21259 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ was founded durring the early 11th century, by Randren. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Randren.</p>
<p>Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ is is constructed arround a semi-circular spacious carved bedrock mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹'s wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹ might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Mærîhi Ràha Higu̹'s mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>

<p>Hamplyn (/hamplyn/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small Town located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHobben.html">Kingdom of Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hamplyn is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hamplyn was founded by <a href="../people/OctolaemusWoodgerBinnington2yz9h2rpj0.html">Octolaemus Woodger Binnington</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hamplyn has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Hamplyn receives an average of 263 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Hamplyn covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2704 m (8871 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hamplyn was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1517, by Octolaemus Woodger Binnington. The establishment of Hamplyn  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hamplyn's construction back out of the project. Octolaemus Woodger Binnington pushed on reguardles, and Hamplyn was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hamplyn was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hamplyn is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Hamplyn is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious split-log ties streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a town of Hamplyn's size could have. Hamplyn's well-designed, yet cheep has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Hamplyn, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all preforming the same rituals to bless and anoint building,s streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holysymbols is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This town certainly loves its god.</p>

<p>Hamplyn's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is long in Hamplyn.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Hamplyn's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Hamplyn used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Hamplyn.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Hamplyn was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Hamplyn. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Hamplyn lost 179 people, 205 livestock, and 90 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 56, when members of Hamplyn's militia enacted an operation to recruit a particular solgiers group. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the bridge, which ended in a stalemate for Hamplyn's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Hamplyn's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

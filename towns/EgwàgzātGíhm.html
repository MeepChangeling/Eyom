<p>Egwàgzāt Gíhm (/ˈegwəg/ /zəˑt/ [appearance (act of appearing)] [clock]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Qùkēi̊vRegion.html">Qùkēi̊v Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Egwàgzāt Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Egwàgzāt Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Brandwennntpfcmag8.html">Brandwen</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Egwàgzāt Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Egwàgzāt Gíhm receives an average of 287 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Egwàgzāt Gíhm covers an area of nearly 189 km<sup>2</sup> (75 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1874 m (6148 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Egwàgzāt Gíhm was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1328, by Brandwen. The establishment of Egwàgzāt Gíhm was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Brandwen struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Egwàgzāt Gíhm as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Egwàgzāt Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Egwàgzāt Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Egwàgzāt Gíhm is buildings are arranged arround a single restrictive cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Egwàgzāt Gíhm, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Egwàgzāt Gíhm has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Egwàgzāt Gíhm suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Egwàgzāt Gíhm long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Egwàgzāt Gíhm's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is skipped in Egwàgzāt Gíhm.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Egwàgzāt Gíhm was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Egwàgzāt Gíhm lost 225 people, 254 livestock, and 40 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 213, when members of Egwàgzāt Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular strategic location from enemy attack. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the strategic location, which ended in defeat for Egwàgzāt Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Egwàgzāt Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

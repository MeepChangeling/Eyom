<p>Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf (/stesg/ /cu dert/ [decade] [yesterday]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/TemryontPrincipality.html">Temryont Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Soheque.html">Soheque</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Khîmd0iwp1k6pa.html">Khîm</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 3°C (37°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 8°C (46°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf receives an average of 214 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 226 km<sup>2</sup> (90 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3256 m (10682 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf was founded durring the early 11th century, by Khîm. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Khîm.</p>
<p>Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow flagstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>Gïpo-ku Dert Xluwuf's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

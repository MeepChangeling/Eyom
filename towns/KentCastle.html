<p>The name Kent Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kent Castle was founded by <a href="../people/StrekkaNorringtonHarvardkjg6tystic.html">Strekka Norrington Harvard</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kent Castle has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Kent Castle receives an average of 214 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kent Castle covers an area of nearly 173 km<sup>2</sup> (69 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3372 m (11062 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kent Castle was founded durring the early 17th century in early spring of the year 1604, by Strekka Norrington Harvard. The establishment of Kent Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Kent Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kent Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kent Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of spacious gravel streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Kent Castle has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Kent Castle’s streets. Yet, deep down, you know this atmosphere is a carefully created illusion. You can see the ocasional seam in their tapestry. You’re not sure what has them doing their best to act so carefree, but act carefree they do.</p>

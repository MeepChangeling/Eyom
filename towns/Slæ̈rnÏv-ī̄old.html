<p>Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old (/ɪv/ /iˈjold/ [temporary] [exam]) is a temperate City located in the <a href="../provences/KïlxcïäjPrincipality.html">Kïlxcïäj Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Yastas.html">Yastas</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old was founded by <a href="../people/Owaintnz2r58p3gm.html">Owaint</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old has a yearly average temperature of -7°C (20°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -36°C (-32°F). Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old receives an average of 209 cm/y (82 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old covers an area of nearly 44 km<sup>2</sup> (17 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3066 m (10059 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1236, by Owaint. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old's construction back out of the project. Owaint pushed on reguardles, and Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old is is constructed  arround a series of broad paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Astonishigly, the budget oriented are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Looking around Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old there is always just enough rain to be annoying.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old has a conflict with a neighboring community. This usually isn't part of a larger war, but is instead a personal animosity between them.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old lost 219 people, 142 livestock, and 58 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 92, when members of Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular enemy resource intact. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Slæ̈rn Ïv-ī̄old's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

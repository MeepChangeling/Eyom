<p>The name Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Kèsëgh88mmap4s.html">Kèsë</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F).

Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow covers an area of nearly 41 km<sup>2</sup> (16 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 10128 m (-9721 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow was founded durring the late 17th century in early winter of the year 1572, by Kèsë. The establishment of Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive flagstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow lost 152 people, 395 livestock, and 77 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 189, when members of Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a stalemate for Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nombo̠ Nön Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

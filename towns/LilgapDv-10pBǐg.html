<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg was founded durring the early 9th century, by Shelîb. The establishment of Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg lost 118 people, 120 livestock, and 47 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 225, when members of Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg's militia enacted an operation to rescue a specific  mage from the enemy. The operation was complicated by extremely hostile wildlife which took many out of action. The conflict ended with the defense of the port against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lilgap Dv-10p Bǐg's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>The name Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ was founded by <a href="../people/Trêmlbzwkpfhyz.html">Trêm</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1139, by Trêm. The establishment of Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ's construction back out of the project. Trêm pushed on reguardles, and Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt packed earth streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Chyàyûlà Rûyi Mudâ tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

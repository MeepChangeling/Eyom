<p>Ûli Korà Gûchya (/ˈʊli/ /ˈkorə/ [sorry; sad] [ambassador]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/S̺àûChyideKingdom.html">S̺àû Chyide Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/MîKûràEmpire.html">Mî Kûrà Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ûli Korà Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ûli Korà Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Vris8x8p2czhx3.html">Vris</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ûli Korà Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Ûli Korà Gûchya receives an average of 149 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ûli Korà Gûchya covers an area of nearly 30 km<sup>2</sup> (12 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6608 m (-21269 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ûli Korà Gûchya was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1329, by Vris. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Vris.</p>
<p>Ûli Korà Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ûli Korà Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ûli Korà Gûchya is buildings are speckled and packed arround crampt flagstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Ûli Korà Gûchya's cost-cutting-focused defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Ûli Korà Gûchya shows Ûli Korà Gûchya is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

<p>Ûli Korà Gûchya's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Ûli Korà Gûchya used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Ûli Korà Gûchya.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century heavy spring rains following an uncharacteristically dry year and a minor earthquake resulted in the collapse of the south side of Kangri Valley. the landslide struck Ûli Korà Gûchya, and devastated the community. 169 people, 372 livestock, and 74 buildings were lost to the calamity. The disaster is recorded in history as Dread's Fall.</p>

<p>Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû (/ˈkudə/ /loˈmiqʊ/ [previous] [hip]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/LakâKâziPrincipality.html">Lakâ Kâzi Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kakoray.html">Kakoray</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû was founded by <a href="../people/Ktîjz7mqdh64ih.html">Ktîj</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -12°C (11°F). Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû receives an average of 241 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû covers an area of nearly 133 km<sup>2</sup> (53 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4830 m (15846 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1409, by Ktîj. The establishment of Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ktîj struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad gravel streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû's millitarily questionable fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<p>Chyameya Kudà Lomiqû's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

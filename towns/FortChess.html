<p>The name Fort Chess is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Chess was founded by <a href="../people/H́ithi̊Greggrgdbr5h58a.html">H́ithi̊ Gregg</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Chess has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F).

Fort Chess covers an area of nearly 49 km<sup>2</sup> (19 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3618 m (11870 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Chess was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1200, by H́ithi̊ Gregg. The establishment of Fort Chess suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Fort Chess was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Chess is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fort Chess is is constructed  arround a series of premissive cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The city's robustly designed timber walls are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Fort Chess, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all preforming the same rituals to bless and anoint building,s streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holysymbols is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This city certainly loves its god.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fort Chess's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Fort Chess every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LizardNarav.html">Lizard, Narav</a> near Fort Chess are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Fort Chess's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Invocation energies of tier 3 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 1 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Loch Payee began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which devastated , killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. An estimated  people,  livestock, and  buildings were lost to the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Mourning Wind.</p>

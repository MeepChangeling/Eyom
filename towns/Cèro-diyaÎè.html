<p>Cèro-diya Îè (/ˈcèro/ /ˈdija/ [scared; afraid] [brush; beard; brush (for hair)]) is a tropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SolonbelmanaCounty.html">Solonbelmana County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Cèro-diya Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Cèro-diya Îè was founded by Zëd, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Cèro-diya Îè has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Cèro-diya Îè receives an average of 232 cm/y (91 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Cèro-diya Îè covers an area of nearly 268 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2270 m (7447 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cèro-diya Îè was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1173, by Zëd. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Cèro-diya Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cèro-diya Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Cèro-diya Îè is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The riverside city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Cèro-diya Îè's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Astonishigly, the political statment focused walls are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Cèro-diya Îè seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Cèro-diya Îè the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

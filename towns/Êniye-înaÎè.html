<p>Êniye-îna Îè (/ɘˈnije/ /ˈɪna/ [intimate] [task]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CyseriusProvince.html">Cyserius Province</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êniye-îna Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êniye-îna Îè was founded by Tshêlê, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êniye-îna Îè has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Êniye-îna Îè receives an average of 274 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Êniye-îna Îè covers an area of nearly 281 km<sup>2</sup> (112 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 990 m (3248 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êniye-îna Îè was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1145, by Tshêlê. The establishment of Êniye-îna Îè suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Êniye-îna Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êniye-îna Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Êniye-îna Îè is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The valley city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Astonishigly, the failry decent fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Êniye-îna Îè is like looking into a university’s plaza on the day before an exam. People rush about to-and-fro. Discarded scrolls and quills are dotted around  city. In spite of many locals discussing academic topics, there’s little sign of any organized groups for any of that talk. Infact, the city seems disordered in general with everything scattered helter skelter about.</p>

<p>Êniye-îna Îè's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

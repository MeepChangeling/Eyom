<p>The name Chillingwood Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chillingwood Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Důhi̊Tibbetsvmz2u55y5v.html">Důhi̊ Tibbets</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chillingwood Castle was founded durring the early 10th century, by Důhi̊ Tibbets. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Důhi̊ Tibbets.</p>
<p>Chillingwood Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chillingwood Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chillingwood Castle is buildings are built arround a single spacious packed earth mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Chillingwood Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Chillingwood Castle rainbows form quite often above the Large City.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Chillingwood Castle is still bloodied by a recent violent conflict. A crushing bandit raid, a lost siege, getting caught at the periphery of a major battle, or some other calamity has inflicted severe damage on the place. Some communities may suffer a longer-term version of this, their youths lost in a grinding, endless battle against some perpetual threat.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Chillingwood Castle was attacked by a group of nobles with their private armies. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Chillingwood Castle lost 210 people, 360 livestock, and 94 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 142, when members of Chillingwood Castle's militia enacted an operation to eliminate a specific group of the enemy's forces. The operation was complicated by extremely hostile wildlife which took many out of action. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the mine, which ended in a stalemate for Chillingwood Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Chillingwood Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

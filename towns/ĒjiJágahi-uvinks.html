<p>The name Ēji Jágahi-uvinks is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zräysian.html">Gnollish</a> language, as Ēji Jágahi-uvinks was founded by Horxohz vyim Roxlendfilf, who was culturaly Gnollish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ēji Jágahi-uvinks was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1343, by Horxohz vyim Roxlendfilf. The establishment of Ēji Jágahi-uvinks suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Ēji Jágahi-uvinks which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Ēji Jágahi-uvinks was built using the conventions of Gnollish durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ēji Jágahi-uvinks is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Ēji Jágahi-uvinks is buildings are arranged within a network of crampt packed earth streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The lakeside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Ēji Jágahi-uvinks, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Ēji Jágahi-uvinks's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Ēji Jágahi-uvinks has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ēji Jágahi-uvinks long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Ēji Jágahi-uvinks's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Ēji Jágahi-uvinks every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Ēji Jágahi-uvinks was attacked by savage hagss living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ēji Jágahi-uvinks lost 290 people, 269 livestock, and 90 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 48, when members of Ēji Jágahi-uvinks's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to a 's family member, then secure them. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Ēji Jágahi-uvinks's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ēji Jágahi-uvinks's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

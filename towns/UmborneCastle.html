<p>Umborne Castle (/umborne/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Umborne Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Umborne Castle was founded by <a href="../people/SzelzusClift6xfb7yp8r0.html">Szelzus Clift</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Umborne Castle has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Umborne Castle receives an average of 286 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Umborne Castle covers an area of nearly 197 km<sup>2</sup> (78 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1864 m (6115 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Umborne Castle was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1306, by Szelzus Clift. The establishment of Umborne Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Szelzus Clift struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Umborne Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Umborne Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Umborne Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Umborne Castle is buildings are built arround a single crampt flagstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Umborne Castle's would-be-castle fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Umborne Castle seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Umborne Castle the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

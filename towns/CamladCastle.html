<p>Camlad Castle (/camlad/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/NorwitchDutchy.html">Norwitch Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/WowoufadaKingdom.html">Wowoufada Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Camlad Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Camlad Castle was founded by <a href="../people/EveHolidayKettleboroughRainsfordwbbqha9rzy.html">Eve Holiday Kettleborough Rainsford</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Camlad Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Camlad Castle receives an average of 146 cm/y (57 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Camlad Castle covers an area of nearly 181 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6266 m (20557 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Camlad Castle was founded durring the late 17th century in early spring of the year 1574, by Eve Holiday Kettleborough Rainsford. The establishment of Camlad Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Camlad Castle's construction back out of the project. Eve Holiday Kettleborough Rainsford pushed on reguardles, and Camlad Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Camlad Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Camlad Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Camlad Castle is buildings folow an organic layout of restrictive cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Camlad Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Camlad Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<p>Camlad Castle's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

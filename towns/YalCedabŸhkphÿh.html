<p>Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh (/jal/ /kiˈdab/ [dim] [killer]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CålärufProvence.html">Cåläruf Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/Brënmtesílhvtsadk7q.html">Brënmtesí</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh has a yearly average temperature of 32°C (89°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 37°C (98°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 28°C (82°F). Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh receives an average of 66 cm/y (25 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh covers an area of nearly 62 km<sup>2</sup> (24 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 21498 m (-15367 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1056, by Brënmtesí. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Brënmtesí.</p>
<p>Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the broad cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Yal Cedab Ÿhkphÿh hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

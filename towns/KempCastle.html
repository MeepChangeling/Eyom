<p>Kemp Castle (/kɛmp/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GumadaProvence.html">Gumada Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kemp Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kemp Castle was founded by <a href="../people/OnshiHoodhbrmrjzr40.html">Onshi Hood</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kemp Castle has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F).

Kemp Castle covers an area of nearly 86 km<sup>2</sup> (34 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2430 m (7972 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kemp Castle was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1052, by Onshi Hood. The establishment of Kemp Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Kemp Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Kemp Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kemp Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Kemp Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious flagstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Kemp Castle's failry decent fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kemp Castle's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Kemp Castle tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>

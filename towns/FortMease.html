<p>Fort Mease (/miz/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/WeianRegion.html">Weian Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Mease is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Mease was founded by <a href="../people/GalbenLum7wizk0vf33.html">Galben Lum</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Mease has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Fort Mease receives an average of 275 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Fort Mease covers an area of nearly 37 km<sup>2</sup> (14 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2166 m (7106 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Mease was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1271, by Galben Lum. The establishment of Fort Mease suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Fort Mease which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Fort Mease was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Mease is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fort Mease is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive worn bedrock mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Fort Mease's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Fort Mease's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Fort Mease seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Fort Mease the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Fort Mease they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>
<p>Fort Mease's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Fort Mease.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Almiraj.html">Almiraj</a> near Fort Mease are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Fort Mease's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Invocation energies of tier 2 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

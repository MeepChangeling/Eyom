<p>Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v (/nət/ /ˈi̘rlʊ/ [nest; den; apartment] [yogurt]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MeaaveaRegion.html">Meaavea Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Dargurnsr2fvtta24.html">Dargurn</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 208 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1188, by Dargurn. The establishment of Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v's construction back out of the project. Dargurn pushed on reguardles, and Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v is is constructed  arround a series of premissive worn bedrock mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Nàti̊rlù Ji̊ Qi̊v's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>

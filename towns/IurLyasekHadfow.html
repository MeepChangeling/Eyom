<p>Iur Lyasek Hadfow (/jur/ /ˈljasek/ [random] [patriot]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/VrötyodmuParish.html">Vrötyodmu Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/ZōzqutDiocese.html">Zōzqut Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Iur Lyasek Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Iur Lyasek Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Ambylusucrbtuybzd.html">Ambylus</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Iur Lyasek Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Iur Lyasek Hadfow receives an average of 160 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Iur Lyasek Hadfow covers an area of nearly 88 km<sup>2</sup> (35 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4554 m (14940 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Iur Lyasek Hadfow was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1248, by Ambylus. The establishment of Iur Lyasek Hadfow  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Iur Lyasek Hadfow's construction back out of the project. Ambylus pushed on reguardles, and Iur Lyasek Hadfow was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Iur Lyasek Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Iur Lyasek Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Iur Lyasek Hadfow is buildings have been located at convienant points along the dale Iur Lyasek Hadfow was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious packed earth streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Iur Lyasek Hadfow's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Astonishigly, the budget oriented are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Iur Lyasek Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Iur Lyasek Hadfow ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Iur Lyasek Hadfow's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Iur Lyasek Hadfow.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Dlurgraven.html">Dlurgraven</a> near Iur Lyasek Hadfow are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Iur Lyasek Hadfow's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves creating small tokens to channel Transmutation energies of tier 3 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

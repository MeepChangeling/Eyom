<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qamame Evâ Gûchya was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1282, by Êrêv. The establishment of Qamame Evâ Gûchya was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Êrêv struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qamame Evâ Gûchya as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qamame Evâ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qamame Evâ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qamame Evâ Gûchya is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt flagstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Qamame Evâ Gûchya's exceptionaly well made fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Qamame Evâ Gûchya has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Qamame Evâ Gûchya ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Qamame Evâ Gûchya is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Qamame Evâ Gûchya was like during the glorydays.</p>

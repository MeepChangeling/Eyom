<p>Nowas Emyǟ Gri (/ˈnowas/ /ˈemjaː/ [dirty] [orphan]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ËkkuvMoot.html">Ëkkuv Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nowas Emyǟ Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Nowas Emyǟ Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Trèbèlt8ny42vsh.html">Trèbè</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nowas Emyǟ Gri has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -12°C (11°F). Nowas Emyǟ Gri receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Nowas Emyǟ Gri covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4742 m (15557 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nowas Emyǟ Gri was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1447, by Trèbè. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Trèbè.</p>
<p>Nowas Emyǟ Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nowas Emyǟ Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nowas Emyǟ Gri is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow baked earthen streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Nowas Emyǟ Gri, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Nowas Emyǟ Gri is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Nowas Emyǟ Gri is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Nowas Emyǟ Gri possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Nowas Emyǟ Gri was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nowas Emyǟ Gri lost 205 people, 347 livestock, and 36 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 220, when members of Nowas Emyǟ Gri's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular production site from enemy attack. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in defeat for Nowas Emyǟ Gri's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nowas Emyǟ Gri's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

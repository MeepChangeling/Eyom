<p>Nëcê-enê Ye (/ˈsonɘ/ /ˈenɘ/ [coherent] [land; ground; soil; dust; clay]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SolonbelmanaCounty.html">Solonbelmana County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nëcê-enê Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nëcê-enê Ye was founded by Giant Emperor Scorpions, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nëcê-enê Ye has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Nëcê-enê Ye receives an average of 206 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Nëcê-enê Ye covers an area of nearly 334 km<sup>2</sup> (133 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2274 m (7460 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nëcê-enê Ye was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1471, by Giant Emperor Scorpions. The establishment of Nëcê-enê Ye  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Nëcê-enê Ye's construction back out of the project. Giant Emperor Scorpions pushed on reguardles, and Nëcê-enê Ye was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Nëcê-enê Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nëcê-enê Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Nëcê-enê Ye is buildings are built arround a single premissive canals mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The cliffside city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Nëcê-enê Ye hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Nëcê-enê Ye possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>Nëcê-enê Ye has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<p>Nëcê-enê Ye's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Nëcê-enê Ye birds speak prophesy.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

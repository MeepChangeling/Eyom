<p>Boke Tsvíhzvuj (Tsvíhz /vuʤ/ [locksmith] [palm (of hand)]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Zèy̼iglesCounty.html">Zèy̼igles County</a>, <a href="../provences/FtèwupProvence.html">Ftèwup Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Tsvíhzvuj is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Tsvíhzvuj was founded by <a href="../people/Trîbêgfm494hhlp.html">Trîbê</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Tsvíhzvuj has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Boke Tsvíhzvuj receives an average of 221 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Boke Tsvíhzvuj covers an area of nearly 157 km<sup>2</sup> (62 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7580 m (-18080 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Tsvíhzvuj was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1171, by Trîbê. The establishment of Boke Tsvíhzvuj  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Boke Tsvíhzvuj's construction back out of the project. Trîbê pushed on reguardles, and Boke Tsvíhzvuj was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Boke Tsvíhzvuj was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Tsvíhzvuj is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Boke Tsvíhzvuj is buildings folow an organic layout of restrictive flagstone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Boke Tsvíhzvuj's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Boke Tsvíhzvuj's political statment focused walls has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Boke Tsvíhzvuj hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Boke Tsvíhzvuj's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In Boke Tsvíhzvuj there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

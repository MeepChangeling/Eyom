<p>The name Xlupo-uz Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Xlupo-uz Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Trgê39b2ytw0zp.html">Trgê</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Xlupo-uz Xluwuf was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1352, by Trgê. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Xlupo-uz Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Xlupo-uz Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Xlupo-uz Xluwuf is is constructed  arround a series of crampt split-log ties mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Unfortuantly, these brittle defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Xlupo-uz Xluwuf makes you wonder how anything ever gets done. The locals have clear, obvious rivalries with one another, as seen through clenched teeth and fake smiles. What’s more, there is a serious lack of any organization and planning in Xlupo-uz Xluwuf’s layout as well as the local’s behaviors. The city seems to be a den of chaos where tongues are forked and local customs do not exist.</p>

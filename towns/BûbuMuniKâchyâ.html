<p>The name Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Tarad9wy4pwuy0t.html">Tarad</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F).

Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 102 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6378 m (20925 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1421, by Tarad. The establishment of Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ's construction back out of the project. Tarad pushed on reguardles, and Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ is is constructed arround a semi-circular premissive cobblestone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Bûbu Muni Kâchyâ ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

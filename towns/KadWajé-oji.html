<p>Kad Wajé-oji (/wajj/ /ojj/ [best] [coconut]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NgelágemimPrincipality.html">Ngelágemim Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Pelala.html">Pelala</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Wajé-oji is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Wajé-oji was founded by <a href="../people/Grêi0axku84fm.html">Grê</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Wajé-oji has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 9°C (48°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Kad Wajé-oji receives an average of 234 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Kad Wajé-oji covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1412 m (4632 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Wajé-oji was founded durring the late 17th century in late spring of the year 1583, by Grê. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Kad Wajé-oji was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Wajé-oji is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Kad Wajé-oji is is constructed  arround a series of narrow cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Kad Wajé-oji, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Kad Wajé-oji hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Wajé-oji's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves.

The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Kad Wajé-oji's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>In Kad Wajé-oji during thunderstorms, with each flash of lightning, everyone sees different monsters from the corner of their eyes.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kad Wajé-oji was attacked by a slaver gang capable of fielding large forces. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kad Wajé-oji lost 138 people, 344 livestock, and 39 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 100, when members of Kad Wajé-oji's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular depot intact. The operation was complicated by thick blankets of fog, which hid friend and foe alike. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Kad Wajé-oji's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kad Wajé-oji's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

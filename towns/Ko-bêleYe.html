<p>Ko-bêle Ye (/ko/ /ˈbɘle/ [maroon] [enemy; rival]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/VabîksêjekèCounty.html">Vabîksêjekè County</a>, <a href="../provences/NarienleanShire.html">Narienlean Shire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ko-bêle Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Ko-bêle Ye was founded by Brîtco Thiestresh, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ko-bêle Ye has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Ko-bêle Ye receives an average of 150 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Ko-bêle Ye covers an area of nearly 380 km<sup>2</sup> (152 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3142 m (10308 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ko-bêle Ye was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1060, by Brîtco Thiestresh. The establishment of Ko-bêle Ye  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ko-bêle Ye's construction back out of the project. Brîtco Thiestresh pushed on reguardles, and Ko-bêle Ye was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ko-bêle Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ko-bêle Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ko-bêle Ye is buildings are built arround a single crampt cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The riverside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Ko-bêle Ye, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Ko-bêle Ye has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ko-bêle Ye long.</p>

<p>Ko-bêle Ye is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Ko-bêle Ye might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Ko-bêle Ye's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Ko-bêle Ye the water is caffeinated.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Xtabay.html">Xtabay</a> near Ko-bêle Ye are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Ko-bêle Ye's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves gestures to channel Mysticism energies of tier 2 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Ko-bêle Ye's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Ko-bêle Ye suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century several years of heavy rains culminated in a peculiar disaster. A great hole opened up beneath Ko-bêle Ye, swallowing large sections of the community. Ko-bêle Ye lost 151 people, 200 livestock, and 94 buildings in the disaster. This disaster is often refereed to as The Death Swallowing.</p>

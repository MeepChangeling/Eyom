<p>Qabíí-êla Ye (/ˈëno/ /ˈɘla/ [intense] [grade; rank (position)]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HansaCanton.html">Hansa Canton</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qabíí-êla Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qabíí-êla Ye was founded by Lobordes, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qabíí-êla Ye has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Qabíí-êla Ye receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Qabíí-êla Ye covers an area of nearly 276 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1172 m (3845 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qabíí-êla Ye was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1232, by Lobordes. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Lobordes.</p>
<p>Qabíí-êla Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qabíí-êla Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qabíí-êla Ye is was constructed arround several crampt cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The riverside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Qabíí-êla Ye, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Qabíí-êla Ye has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Qabíí-êla Ye ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>A substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign settlement conquered within the relatively recent past. The locals may not be enthusiastic about being ruled by others not of their kind, and their neighbors may look askance at the way foreign customs or even laws may be maintained.</p>
<p>Qabíí-êla Ye's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Qabíí-êla Ye.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Urdefhan.html">Urdefhan</a> near Qabíí-êla Ye are known to be quite timid.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

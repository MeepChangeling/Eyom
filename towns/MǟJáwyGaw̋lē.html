<p>Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē (/mǣ/ /ʤɔ́ːiː/ [sore] [curtain]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/BuziaCounty.html">Buzia County</a> of the <a href="../nations/ConfederationofGoblinTribes.html">Confederation of Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē was founded by <a href="../people/DuncanGlenScottb23s6ss994.html">Duncan Glen Scott</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē receives an average of 219 cm/y (86 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē covers an area of nearly 320 km<sup>2</sup> (128 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1128 m (3700 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1126, by Duncan Glen Scott. The establishment of Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē is is constructed  arround a series of spacious paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>In Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē the water is caffeinated.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Atomie.html">Atomie</a> near Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Mǟ Jáwy Gaw̋lē's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>

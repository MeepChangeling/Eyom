<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1269, by Ezkric. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Astonishigly, the top tier civilian fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû was like during the glorydays.</p>

<p>A substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign settlement conquered within the relatively recent past. The locals may not be enthusiastic about being ruled by others not of their kind, and their neighbors may look askance at the way foreign customs or even laws may be maintained.</p>
<p>Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû lost 224 people, 199 livestock, and 87 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 151, when members of Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about the enemy. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with the defense of the fortification against a siege, which ended in defeat for Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Chyameya Làsæ Bàbû's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

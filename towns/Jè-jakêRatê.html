<p>Jè-jakê Ratê (/ʤè/ /ˈʤakɘ/ [cream] [grandfather]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FîthdekîZone.html">Fîthdekî Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jè-jakê Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Jè-jakê Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Gwyneth8xmg0nwl8y.html">Gwyneth</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jè-jakê Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Jè-jakê Ratê receives an average of 223 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Jè-jakê Ratê covers an area of nearly 159 km<sup>2</sup> (63 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 766 m (2513 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jè-jakê Ratê was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1442, by Gwyneth. The establishment of Jè-jakê Ratê was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Gwyneth electing to pay people to resettle in Jè-jakê Ratê.</p>
<p>Jè-jakê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jè-jakê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Jè-jakê Ratê is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of broad packed earth streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Jè-jakê Ratê has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Jè-jakê Ratê suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Jè-jakê Ratê long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Jè-jakê Ratê's locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Jè-jakê Ratê's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>In Jè-jakê Ratê rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>

<p>Jè-jakê Ratê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Charm energies of tier 2 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

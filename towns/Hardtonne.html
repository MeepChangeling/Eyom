<p>Hardtonne (/hɑːd/ /tʌn/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/GreenthmageDutchy.html">Greenthmage Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/ChartontareCounty.html">Chartontare County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hardtonne is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hardtonne was founded by <a href="../people/BrachyzoaIngersollbqax2ngkc3.html">Brachyzoa Ingersoll</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hardtonne has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Hardtonne receives an average of 141 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Hardtonne covers an area of nearly 403 km<sup>2</sup> (161 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5196 m (17047 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hardtonne was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1161, by Brachyzoa Ingersoll. The establishment of Hardtonne  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hardtonne's construction back out of the project. Brachyzoa Ingersoll pushed on reguardles, and Hardtonne was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hardtonne was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hardtonne is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Hardtonne is buildings are arranged arround a single premissive flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Hardtonne, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Hardtonne's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Hardtonne, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Hardtonne.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Hardtonne's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Hardtonne the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\OozeAmber.html">Ooze, Amber</a> near Hardtonne are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Hardtonne's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 2 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

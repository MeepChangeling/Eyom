<p>Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä (/jɒ̄g/ /wɑ́zɜː/ [pretty] [will]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MawtḩīZárProvence.html">Mawtḩī Zár Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/KêlKèsèHëîbêa0kbwndw43.html">Kêl Kèsè Hëîbê</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 274 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1974 m (6476 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 17th century in early winter of the year 1582, by Kêl Kèsè Hëîbê. The establishment of Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad packed earth streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by grandeur of scale, simplicity of geometric forms, dramatic use of columns, and a preference for blank walls. This design ethos extended to re-imagining earlier styles of structure to create them anew, with a similar overall look and feel to one another..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä.</p>

<p>Yaw̄g Wázer Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves performance art to channel Transmutation energies of tier 1 via mimery.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

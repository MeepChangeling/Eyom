<p>The name Lilgap Ff-55b Ril is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lilgap Ff-55b Ril was founded by <a href="../people/Rz-56sDotMatrix2nn0uygp9n.html">Rz-56s 'Dot Matrix'</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lilgap Ff-55b Ril has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Lilgap Ff-55b Ril receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lilgap Ff-55b Ril covers an area of nearly 120 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4406 m (14455 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lilgap Ff-55b Ril was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1375, by Rz-56s 'Dot Matrix'. The establishment of Lilgap Ff-55b Ril was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Rz-56s 'Dot Matrix' struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Lilgap Ff-55b Ril as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Lilgap Ff-55b Ril was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilgap Ff-55b Ril is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Lilgap Ff-55b Ril is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow packed earth mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Lilgap Ff-55b Ril weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Unfortuantly, these budget focused millitary grade defenses are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Lilgap Ff-55b Ril proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lilgap Ff-55b Ril has a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.</p>
<p>Lilgap Ff-55b Ril's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\DeerRinghorn.html">Deer, Ringhorn</a> near Lilgap Ff-55b Ril are known to be quite timid.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Lilgap Ff-55b Ril was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Lilgap Ff-55b Ril. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lilgap Ff-55b Ril lost 186 people, 369 livestock, and 88 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 152, when members of Lilgap Ff-55b Ril's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to a  noble, then secure them. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with the defense of the port against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Lilgap Ff-55b Ril's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lilgap Ff-55b Ril's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

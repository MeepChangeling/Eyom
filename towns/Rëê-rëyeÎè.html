<p>Rëê-rëye Îè (/ˈrëɘ/ /ˈrëje/ [hay] [fungus]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/TlaumaCounty.html">Tlauma County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Rëê-rëye Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Rëê-rëye Îè was founded by Snocthi, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Rëê-rëye Îè has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Rëê-rëye Îè receives an average of 285 cm/y (112 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Rëê-rëye Îè covers an area of nearly 268 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1826 m (5990 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rëê-rëye Îè was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1394, by Snocthi. The establishment of Rëê-rëye Îè  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Rëê-rëye Îè's construction back out of the project. Snocthi pushed on reguardles, and Rëê-rëye Îè was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Rëê-rëye Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rëê-rëye Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Rëê-rëye Îè is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow flagstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The byou city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Rëê-rëye Îè's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Unfortuantly, these unusual though effective defenses are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Rëê-rëye Îè has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Rëê-rëye Îè ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Rëê-rëye Îè is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Rëê-rëye Îè was like during the glorydays.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Rëê-rëye Îè possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>Rëê-rëye Îè has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Rëê-rëye Îè's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Rëê-rëye Îè's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Rëê-rëye Îè the water is caffeinated.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\HerdAnimalStag.html">Herd Animal, Stag</a> near Rëê-rëye Îè are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Rëê-rëye Îè is surrounded by dangerous terrain: miasmatic swamps, perilous crevasses, radioactive badlands, a pocket of or some other harmful topography. Rëê-rëye Îè might prefer the defensive potential of the terrain here, or have found a precious resource worth the danger.

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Mourning Mountain, an iconic vista located neare Rëê-rëye Îè, proved to be volcanic when the mountain erupted. The eruption was isolated to the area around Rëê-rëye Îè, which was swallowed in ash, lava flows, and pyroclastic gasses. Rëê-rëye Îè lost 189 people, 301 livestock, and 33 buildings in the disaster. The event is forever remembered as the Day of Mourning's Wrath.</p>

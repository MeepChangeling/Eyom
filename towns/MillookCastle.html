<p>Millook Castle (/millook/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/BarrowfalconDutchy.html">Barrowfalcon Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DuyteaKingdom.html">Duytea Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Millook Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Millook Castle was founded by <a href="../people/OlwendaSeacole7sgr2pgsss.html">Olwenda Seacole</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Millook Castle has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Millook Castle receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Millook Castle covers an area of nearly 44 km<sup>2</sup> (17 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3526 m (11568 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Millook Castle was founded durring the late 10th century, by Olwenda Seacole. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Millook Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Millook Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Millook Castle is buildings are built arround a single spacious packed earth mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is protected by a humble stone fence which is tall enough to provide adiquite cover for defenders to fire from, but no more than that. The peasent-grade has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Millook Castle proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Millook Castle is reliant on an industry or product that has toxic or negative side-effects as part of its production. The good is extremely valuable, or the community is extremely desperate, and the side effects are endured as a necessary evil. It may be that their neighbors or lord are forcing them to produce the good so that they aren’t the ones suffering the cost.</p>
<p>Millook Castle's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Millook Castle was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Millook Castle lost 203 people, 184 livestock, and 73 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 146, when members of Millook Castle's militia enacted an operation to fortify a particular fortification. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the fortification, which ended in defeat for Millook Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Millook Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Viz-lájf Xluwuf (/viz/ /lə˞jf/ [thin (narrow); narrow] [celebrity]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HuzmäPrincipality.html">Huzmä Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Lallalo.html">Lallalo</a>.</p>
<p>The name Viz-lájf Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Viz-lájf Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Tshêhlqfktdi8z.html">Tshê</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Viz-lájf Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of -1°C (31°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 8°C (46°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -10°C (14°F). Viz-lájf Xluwuf receives an average of 256 cm/y (100 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Viz-lájf Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 87 km<sup>2</sup> (34 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1526 m (5006 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Viz-lájf Xluwuf was founded durring the early 10th century, by Tshê. The establishment of Viz-lájf Xluwuf  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Viz-lájf Xluwuf's construction back out of the project. Tshê pushed on reguardles, and Viz-lájf Xluwuf was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Viz-lájf Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Viz-lájf Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Viz-lájf Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious carved bedrock streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Viz-lájf Xluwuf, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Viz-lájf Xluwuf. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

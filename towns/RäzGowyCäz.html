<p>The name Räz Gowy Cäz is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Gowy Cäz was founded by <a href="../people/Dranusw57jlmpdcn.html">Dranus</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Räz Gowy Cäz has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Gowy Cäz was founded durring the early 10th century, by Dranus. The establishment of Räz Gowy Cäz suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Räz Gowy Cäz was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Gowy Cäz is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Gowy Cäz is buildings are built arround a single premissive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Astonishigly, the exceptionaly well made fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Räz Gowy Cäz has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Räz Gowy Cäz long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Räz Gowy Cäz is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>

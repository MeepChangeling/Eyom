<p>Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ (/saːt/ /ˈntamvu/ [gorgeous] [patient; victim]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ol-DidEarldom.html">Ol-Did Earldom</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ was founded by Cynog Cockerell Phrugremen, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -10°C (14°F). Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ receives an average of 159 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ covers an area of nearly 399 km<sup>2</sup> (159 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3294 m (10807 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ was founded in time immemorial, reportedly some time durring the late 8th century, by Cynog Cockerell Phrugremen. The establishment of Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the late 8th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ is was constructed arround several crampt cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The lakeside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠ might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠'s bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Sǟt Ntamvu Qo̠.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

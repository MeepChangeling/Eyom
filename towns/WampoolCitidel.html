<p>The name Wampool Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wampool Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/BuddugBowerghu7pthxuz.html">Buddug Bower</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wampool Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Wampool Citidel receives an average of 213 cm/y (83 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Wampool Citidel covers an area of nearly 113 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3766 m (12355 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wampool Citidel was founded durring the early 16th century in fall of the year 1531, by Buddug Bower. The establishment of Wampool Citidel suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Wampool Citidel which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Wampool Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wampool Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wampool Citidel is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious paverstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Wampool Citidel's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Wampool Citidel hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Wampool Citidel is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Wampool Citidel is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Wampool Citidel is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with wealth for a year and a day. One of Wampool Citidel's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

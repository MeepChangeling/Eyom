<p>The name Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk was founded by <a href="../people/Tsêrêrèjt8ya96qglf.html">Tsêrêrèj</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk was founded durring the late 11th century, by Tsêrêrèj. The establishment of Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk's construction back out of the project. Tsêrêrèj pushed on reguardles, and Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk shows Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami spared the town from an attack. One of Kad Ogihwo-æ̈tunk's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

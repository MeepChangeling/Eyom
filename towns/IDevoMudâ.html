<p>The name I Devo Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as I Devo Mudâ was founded by Ghrumgris Glêpí, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>I Devo Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -11°C (13°F).

I Devo Mudâ covers an area of nearly 553 km<sup>2</sup> (221 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3218 m (10557 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>I Devo Mudâ was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1204, by Ghrumgris Glêpí. The establishment of I Devo Mudâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding I Devo Mudâ's construction back out of the project. Ghrumgris Glêpí pushed on reguardles, and I Devo Mudâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>I Devo Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and I Devo Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>I Devo Mudâ is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious split-log ties streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>I Devo Mudâ is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea (15305 % 6)+1 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century several years of heavy rains culminated in a peculiar disaster. A great hole opened up beneath I Devo Mudâ, swallowing large sections of the community. I Devo Mudâ lost 101 people, 227 livestock, and 81 buildings in the disaster.

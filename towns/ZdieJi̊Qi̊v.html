<p>Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v (Zdi /e/ [battle; combat] [rain]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WizkèysèProvence.html">Wizkèysè Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Shêlèv56fldj1lh.html">Shêlè</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 275 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 89 km<sup>2</sup> (35 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4724 m (15498 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1481, by Shêlè. The establishment of Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt paverstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Zdie Ji̊ Qi̊v every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

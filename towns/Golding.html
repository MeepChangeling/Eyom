<p>Golding (/gəʊld/ /ing/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/VioletmillDutchy.html">Violetmill Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MerlandCounty.html">Merland County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Golding is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Golding was founded by Eurypterids Crawford, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Golding has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 4°C (39°F). Golding receives an average of 246 cm/y (96 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Golding covers an area of nearly 275 km<sup>2</sup> (110 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 922 m (3024 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Golding was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1246, by Eurypterids Crawford. The establishment of Golding suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Golding was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Golding is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Golding is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious flagstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Golding's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Unfortuantly, these unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Golding hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Golding's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Golding most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\HoarSpirit.html">Hoar Spirit</a> near Golding are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Golding's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves reenactments to channel Enchantment energies of tier 2 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Golding's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Golding is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Mount Ill Tides, an iconic vista located neare Golding, proved to be volcanic when the mountain erupted. The eruption was isolated to the area around Golding, which was swallowed in ash, lava flows, and pyroclastic gasses. Golding lost 124 people, 209 livestock, and 39 buildings in the disaster. The event is forever remembered as the Day of Ill Tides's Wrath.</p>

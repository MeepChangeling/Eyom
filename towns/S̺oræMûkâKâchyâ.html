<p>S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ (/ˈs̺oræ/ /ˈmʊkɑ/ [abundant; lush; fertile] [silence]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/GûS̺àqusæKingdom.html">Gû S̺àqusæ Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/MîKûràEmpire.html">Mî Kûrà Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Warren.html">Warren</a>.</p>
<p>The name S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Knellirhyp7grapcji.html">Knellirh</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5384 m (17664 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 11th century, by Knellirh. The establishment of S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Knellirh struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive packed earth streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ's exceptionaly well made fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The city is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>S̺oræ Mûkâ Kâchyâ's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Fort Padbury (/padbury/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/GreymageDutchy.html">Greymage Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MidateKingdom.html">Midate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Padbury is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Padbury was founded by <a href="../people/BrêrêtcoRiceWelbournzah45fbjvb.html">Brêrêtco Rice Welbourn</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Padbury has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Fort Padbury receives an average of 144 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Fort Padbury covers an area of nearly 83 km<sup>2</sup> (33 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4146 m (13602 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Padbury was founded in time immemorial, reportedly some time durring the late 8th century, by Brêrêtco Rice Welbourn. The establishment of Fort Padbury was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Brêrêtco Rice Welbourn struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Fort Padbury as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Fort Padbury was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 8th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Padbury is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fort Padbury is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Fort Padbury's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Fort Padbury, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fort Padbury's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In Fort Padbury there is always just enough rain to be annoying.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The roads leading into Fort Padbury possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Fort Padbury used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 4 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami spared the town from the rampage of a legendary monster. One of Fort Padbury's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

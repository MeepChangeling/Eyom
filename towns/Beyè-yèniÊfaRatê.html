<p>The name Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Veahlwai5sj6k4p.html">Veahl</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1077, by Veahl. The establishment of Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow paverstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The millitarily questionable fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê’s streets. In spite of this, quite a few people can be seen reading and the city has an abundance of libraries. It’s quite clear the community values education.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Beyè-yèni Êfa Ratê's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

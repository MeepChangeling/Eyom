<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Fèzî-yêvê was founded durring the early 15th century in winter of the year 1425, by Khèbë. The establishment of Êkèkê Fèzî-yêvê was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Khèbë struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Êkèkê Fèzî-yêvê as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fèzî-yêvê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Fèzî-yêvê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fèzî-yêvê is buildings are built arround a single premissive paverstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fèzî-yêvê is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

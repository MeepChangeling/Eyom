<p>Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá (/wə˞p/ /xlə˞/ [single] [horizon]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WápkunjuPrincipality.html">Wápkunju Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Konei.html">Konei</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá was founded by <a href="../people/Brelêffvpjr4b7c.html">Brelê</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá has a yearly average temperature of -4°C (25°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -31°C (-23°F). Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá receives an average of 229 cm/y (90 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá covers an area of nearly 138 km<sup>2</sup> (55 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3712 m (12178 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá was founded durring the late 11th century, by Brelê. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Brelê.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of broad packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Slæ̈rn Wáp-ghlá the water is caffeinated.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

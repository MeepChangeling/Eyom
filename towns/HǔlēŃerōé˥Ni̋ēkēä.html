<p>The name Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/AngharaGwendaHelenysgg835ajstj.html">Anghara Gwenda Helenys</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1289, by Anghara Gwenda Helenys. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Anghara Gwenda Helenys.</p>
<p>Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive canals streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's would-be-castle fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. A second look around Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is recurring in Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\HerdAnimalStag.html">Herd Animal, Stag</a> near Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Hǔlē Ńerōé˥ Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves consuming a local toxin to channel Conjuration energies of tier 2 via mimery.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

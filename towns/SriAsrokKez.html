<p>Sri Asrok Kez (/sri/ /ˈasrok/ [alone] [dealer]) is a subtropical Large Town located in <a href="../subprovences/BonfincělZone.html">Bonfincěl Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/KsiwhuDiocese.html">Ksiwhu Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/CovenentofIrus.html">Covenent of Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sri Asrok Kez is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Sri Asrok Kez was founded by <a href="../people/Mä̌shNīkīyPearllilyzIvyDa̋nvēCúó̄shYa̋shZamezatDistrolj4qmlaw64r.html">Mä̌sh Nīkīy 'Pearllilyz Ivy' Da̋nvē Cúó̄sh Ya̋sh Zamezat Distrol</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Sri Asrok Kez receives an average of 189 cm/y (74 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Sri Asrok Kez covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4712 m (15459 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1210, by Mä̌sh Nīkīy 'Pearllilyz Ivy' Da̋nvē Cúó̄sh Ya̋sh Zamezat Distrol. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Mä̌sh Nīkīy 'Pearllilyz Ivy' Da̋nvē Cúó̄sh Ya̋sh Zamezat Distrol.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sri Asrok Kez is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez is buildings are arranged arround a single crampt flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the town a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  town sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The town's would-be-castle fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>A look around Sri Asrok Kez has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Sri Asrok Kez suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Sri Asrok Kez long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Sri Asrok Kez. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Sri Asrok Kez's parks.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Sri Asrok Kez.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has a Department of Firefighters, which is responsible for organizing fire fighting efforts during a fire and enforcing local ordinances relating to fire safety.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Sri Asrok Kez's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large Town. Sri Asrok Kez's grid is powered by a boiler and turbine based power plant.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Sri Asrok Kez's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Sri Asrok Kez, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used makes use of a large oblong hall or building with double colonnades and a semicircular apse and symmetrical central-plan, resulting in buildings with a square central mass and four arms of equal length. Decorative features included domed rooves, arches, soaring spaces, and sumptuous decoration: marble columns and inlay, mosaics on the vaults, inlaid-stone pavements, and sometimes gold coffered ceilings.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is skipped in Sri Asrok Kez.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Witherstench.html">Witherstench</a> near Sri Asrok Kez are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Sri Asrok Kez's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves ritual combat to channel Transmutation energies of tier 3 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Sri Asrok Kez was attacked by a group of nobles with their private armies. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Sri Asrok Kez lost 239 people, 223 livestock, and 58 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 126, when members of Sri Asrok Kez's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Sri Asrok Kez's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Sri Asrok Kez's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

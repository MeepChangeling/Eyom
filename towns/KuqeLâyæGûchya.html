<p>The name Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Yawmē̄Së̋chHexRobbiGāsVúrmërBēboīybn5qsqv56k.html">Yawmē̄ Së̋ch 'Hex Robbi' Gās Vúrmër Bēboīy</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F). Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya receives an average of 169 cm/y (66 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya covers an area of nearly 73 km<sup>2</sup> (29 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4152 m (13622 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1225, by Yawmē̄ Së̋ch 'Hex Robbi' Gās Vúrmër Bēboīy. The establishment of Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Yawmē̄ Së̋ch 'Hex Robbi' Gās Vúrmër Bēboīy electing to pay people to resettle in Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya.</p>
<p>Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya lost 256 people, 127 livestock, and 48 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 152, when members of Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to a particular vault, then reinforce it. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Kuqe Lâyæ Gûchya's forces.

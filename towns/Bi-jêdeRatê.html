<p>The name Bi-jêde Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Bi-jêde Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Mp̪vë̋Mbó̄̄TignedBellaYoīb̪f̄̄Yä̂férErméoīHa̋chīyNi̋nvé̄su5hrujf3kn.html">Mp̪vë̋ Mbó̄̄ 'Tigned Bella' Yoīb̪f̄̄ Yä̂fér Erméoī Ha̋chīy Ni̋nvé̄s</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bi-jêde Ratê was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1343, by Mp̪vë̋ Mbó̄̄ 'Tigned Bella' Yoīb̪f̄̄ Yä̂fér Erméoī Ha̋chīy Ni̋nvé̄s. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Mp̪vë̋ Mbó̄̄ 'Tigned Bella' Yoīb̪f̄̄ Yä̂fér Erméoī Ha̋chīy Ni̋nvé̄s.</p>
<p>Bi-jêde Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bi-jêde Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Bi-jêde Ratê is buildings are located arround a single broad baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Bi-jêde Ratê's would-be-castle fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Bi-jêde Ratê seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Bi-jêde Ratê's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Bi-jêde Ratê's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 6 years has greatly spiked Bi-jêde Ratê's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century  was struck by a great wind storm.

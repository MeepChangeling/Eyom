<p>Lilgap Yl-40s Zebro was founded durring the late 17th century in late summer of the year 1569, by Galenasseth. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Lilgap Yl-40s Zebro was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilgap Yl-40s Zebro is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Lilgap Yl-40s Zebro is buildings are built arround a single broad packed earth mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Lilgap Yl-40s Zebro has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Lilgap Yl-40s Zebro ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

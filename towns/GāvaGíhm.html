<p>Gāva Gíhm (/gəˑv/ /a/ [compass] [small; little; short; low; miniature]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/TshtobàdCounty.html">Tshtobàd County</a>, <a href="../provences/TarnàgProvence.html">Tarnàg Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gāva Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Gāva Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Tsilî781760l5v2.html">Tsilî</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gāva Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Gāva Gíhm receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Gāva Gíhm covers an area of nearly 174 km<sup>2</sup> (69 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4372 m (14343 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gāva Gíhm was founded durring the late 20th century in early spring of the year 1891, by Tsilî. The establishment of Gāva Gíhm suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Gāva Gíhm which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Gāva Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 20th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gāva Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Gāva Gíhm is buildings are arranged within a network of narrow cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Gāva Gíhm, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Gāva Gíhm hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Gāva Gíhm they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>
<p>Gāva Gíhm's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>In Gāva Gíhm yeast remains dormant.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

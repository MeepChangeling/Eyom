<p>Lilgap Zi-47j Wǐgfæah was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1273, by Jf-32g 'Yo-Yo'. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Jf-32g 'Yo-Yo'.</p>

The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Lilgap Zi-47j Wǐgfæah weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials.

Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly.

<p>The name Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ was founded by <a href="../people/Glêmtcov8xjrtm515.html">Glêmtco</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ covers an area of nearly 115 km<sup>2</sup> (46 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1386 m (4547 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1409, by Glêmtco. The establishment of Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Glêmtco struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive baked earthen streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄'s walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Astonishigly, the boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄ was like during the glorydays.</p>

<p>Räz Fÿhwehz Cab̄'s bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

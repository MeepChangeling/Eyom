<p>Lume Iqû Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 11th century, by Thraaz. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Lume Iqû Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lume Iqû Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Lume Iqû Kâchyâ is buildings folow an organic layout of spacious packed earth streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Lume Iqû Kâchyâ weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lume Iqû Kâchyâ's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

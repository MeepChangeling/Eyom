<p>The name Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ was founded by <a href="../people/Es-48fGuntly975yzjvx.html">Es-48f 'Gunt'</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ receives an average of 228 cm/y (89 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ covers an area of nearly 102 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5120 m (16797 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1226, by Es-48f 'Gunt'. The establishment of Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ's construction back out of the project. Es-48f 'Gunt' pushed on reguardles, and Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of broad cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Năz Lk-64h Nǐgæ there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

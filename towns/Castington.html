<p>Castington  (/castington / [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small Town located in <a href="../subprovences/DogyoCounty.html">Dogyo County</a>, <a href="../provences/YutateCounty.html">Yutate County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Castington  is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Castington  was founded by <a href="../people/GorthasselDavies6kxlfh4ntw.html">Gorthassel Davies</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Castington  has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F). Castington  receives an average of 143 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Castington  covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3240 m (10629 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Castington  was founded durring the early 17th century in late fall of the year 1615, by Gorthassel Davies. The establishment of Castington   was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Castington 's construction back out of the project. Gorthassel Davies pushed on reguardles, and Castington  was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Castington  was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Castington  is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Castington  is was constructed arround several crampt paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The exceptionaly well made fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Castington  has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Castington  ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Castington  is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Castington  was like during the glorydays.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Castington  has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Castington .</p>
<p>Castington  has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Castington  has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Castington  has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Castington  has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Castington 's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Castington  has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.</p>
<p>Castington  has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Castington 's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Castington  tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\MarbleSnake.html">Marble Snake</a> near Castington  are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Castington 's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves consuming a local narcotic to channel Conjuration energies of tier 2 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Castington  is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Castington 's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>

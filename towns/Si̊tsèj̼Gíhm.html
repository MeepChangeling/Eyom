<p>Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm (/si̘t/ /sɛj̼/ [skirt] [basic]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Qùkēi̊vRegion.html">Qùkēi̊v Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Skaarglb90unhm6d.html">Skaarg</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm receives an average of 233 cm/y (91 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm covers an area of nearly 254 km<sup>2</sup> (101 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2026 m (6646 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1401, by Skaarg. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Skaarg.</p>
<p>Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm is buildings folow an organic layout of narrow cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual though effective defenses have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye.</p>

It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>In Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm the stars are always right.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm lost 157 people, 131 livestock, and 30 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 59, when members of Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about a particular bridge. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the bridge, which ended in victory for Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Si̊tsèj̼ Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

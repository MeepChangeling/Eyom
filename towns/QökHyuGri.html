<p>Qök Hyu Gri (/qo˞k/ /hju/ [mobile; portable] [machine; device; equipment]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/KatnatParish.html">Katnat Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/OlaötDiocese.html">Olaöt Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qök Hyu Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qök Hyu Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Trtcok98zc3axmp.html">Trtco</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Qök Hyu Gri receives an average of 116 cm/y (45 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Qök Hyu Gri covers an area of nearly 121 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4470 m (14665 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1271, by Trtco. The establishment of Qök Hyu Gri suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Qök Hyu Gri which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qök Hyu Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Qök Hyu Gri was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the premissive cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Qök Hyu Gri's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual though effective defenses have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Qök Hyu Gri the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Qök Hyu Gri has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items.

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Qök Hyu Gri's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri's locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is recurring in Qök Hyu Gri.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LandLamprey.html">Land Lamprey</a> near Qök Hyu Gri are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves orgies to channel Illusion energies of tier 3 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Qök Hyu Gri's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Qök Hyu Gri suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

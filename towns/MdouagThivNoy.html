<p>Mdouag Thiv Noy (/ˈrɑjɪː/ /ðiːβ/ [allergy] [perception]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SekhefetutCounty.html">Sekhefetut County</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mdouag Thiv Noy is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mdouag Thiv Noy was founded by <a href="../people/H́i̊th666kizcl8c.html">H́i̊th</a>, who was culturaly Rosid.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mdouag Thiv Noy has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -9°C (16°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mdouag Thiv Noy was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1345, by H́i̊th. The establishment of Mdouag Thiv Noy  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Mdouag Thiv Noy's construction back out of the project. H́i̊th pushed on reguardles, and Mdouag Thiv Noy was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Mdouag Thiv Noy was built using the conventions of Rosid durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mdouag Thiv Noy is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Mdouag Thiv Noy is is constructed  arround a series of crampt packed earth mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Mdouag Thiv Noy's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual though effective defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Mdouag Thiv Noy has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Mdouag Thiv Noy ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Mdouag Thiv Noy is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Mdouag Thiv Noy long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Mdouag Thiv Noy they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>
<p>Mdouag Thiv Noy's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Mdouag Thiv Noy hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

<p>Mdouag Thiv Noy's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Mdouag Thiv Noy suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Mdouag Thiv Noy was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Mdouag Thiv Noy lost 151 people, 382 livestock, and 20 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 108, when members of Mdouag Thiv Noy's militia enacted an operation to deliver supplies to a specific research site. The operation was complicated by the enemy setting up an ambush. The conflict ended with the defense of the research site against a siege, which ended in victory for Mdouag Thiv Noy's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Mdouag Thiv Noy's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Kes Qüeöqüe Gri (/kes/ /q˔o˞q˔/ [full] [credit (of money)]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/QuasiuwParish.html">Quasiuw Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/Gi̽chyhye̜Diocese.html">Gi̽chyhye̜ Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kes Qüeöqüe Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Kes Qüeöqüe Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Brîbkvut01gtid.html">Brîb</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kes Qüeöqüe Gri has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Kes Qüeöqüe Gri receives an average of 151 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Kes Qüeöqüe Gri covers an area of nearly 159 km<sup>2</sup> (63 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4252 m (13950 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kes Qüeöqüe Gri was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1060, by Brîb. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Brîb.</p>
<p>Kes Qüeöqüe Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kes Qüeöqüe Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kes Qüeöqüe Gri is buildings are speckled and packed arround premissive packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Kes Qüeöqüe Gri weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Kes Qüeöqüe Gri's budget focused millitary grade defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Kes Qüeöqüe Gri gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Kes Qüeöqüe Gri used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 5 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kes Qüeöqüe Gri was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kes Qüeöqüe Gri lost 158 people, 378 livestock, and 78 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 99, when members of Kes Qüeöqüe Gri's militia enacted an operation to train a group of civilians for a special clandestine operation. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with the defense of the production site against a siege, which ended in a crushing defeat for Kes Qüeöqüe Gri's forces.

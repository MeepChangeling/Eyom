<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Du̹go Bàboyâ Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1349, by Patience. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Patience.</p>
<p>Du̹go Bàboyâ Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Du̹go Bàboyâ Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Du̹go Bàboyâ Kâchyâ is is constructed  arround a series of narrow baked earthen mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Du̹go Bàboyâ Kâchyâ's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Du̹go Bàboyâ Kâchyâ's top tier civilian fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Du̹go Bàboyâ Kâchyâ, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Du̹go Bàboyâ Kâchyâ's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Du̹go Bàboyâ Kâchyâ tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

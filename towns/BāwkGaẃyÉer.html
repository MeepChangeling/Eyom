<p>The name Bāwk Gaẃy Éer is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Bāwk Gaẃy Éer was founded by <a href="../people/CāyYóoīJadeQuinnMb̪voīshHa̋chvēshYaw̄yMēń̄Yoī́̄yz4vj8az01q.html">Cāy Yóoī 'Jade Quinn' Mb̪voīsh Ha̋chvēsh Yaw̄y Mēń̄ Yoī́̄y</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bāwk Gaẃy Éer was founded durring the early 19th century in late fall of the year 1806, by Cāy Yóoī 'Jade Quinn' Mb̪voīsh Ha̋chvēsh Yaw̄y Mēń̄ Yoī́̄y. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Cāy Yóoī 'Jade Quinn' Mb̪voīsh Ha̋chvēsh Yaw̄y Mēń̄ Yoī́̄y.</p>
<p>Bāwk Gaẃy Éer was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 19th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bāwk Gaẃy Éer is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bāwk Gaẃy Éer is buildings folow an organic layout of broad cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The city's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Bāwk Gaẃy Éer has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Bāwk Gaẃy Éer ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Bāwk Gaẃy Éer is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Bāwk Gaẃy Éer long.</p>

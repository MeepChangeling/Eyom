<p>Tib Castle (/tib/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Nō̌gyaw̄wēDutchy.html">Nō̌gyaw̄wē Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DāmêvrKingdom.html">Dāmêvr Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tib Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tib Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ZèlkdshoHolcomb18cyr6ukyj.html">Zèlkdsho Holcomb</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tib Castle has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Tib Castle receives an average of 159 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Tib Castle covers an area of nearly 198 km<sup>2</sup> (79 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4548 m (14921 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tib Castle was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1291, by Zèlkdsho Holcomb. The establishment of Tib Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Tib Castle's construction back out of the project. Zèlkdsho Holcomb pushed on reguardles, and Tib Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Tib Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tib Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Tib Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive flagstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Tib Castle's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Tib Castle's budget oriented are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Tib Castle gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Tib Castle has a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.</p>
<p>Tib Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Tib Castle.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Tib Castle's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Tib Castle suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>

<p>Thorley Citidel (/ˈθɔrli/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Thorley Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Thorley Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/GrèsëdBlanchfieldRockz8vjy3iu8c.html">Grèsëd Blanchfield Rock</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Thorley Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Thorley Citidel receives an average of 268 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Thorley Citidel covers an area of nearly 181 km<sup>2</sup> (72 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1316 m (4317 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Thorley Citidel was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1242, by Grèsëd Blanchfield Rock. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Thorley Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Thorley Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Thorley Citidel is buildings are arranged within a network of crampt worn bedrock streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Thorley Citidel's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Thorley Citidel's political statment focused walls has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Thorley Citidel has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Thorley Citidel ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Thorley Citidel as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Thorley Citidel since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>Thorley Citidel is known for its well built pedestrian paths, which include foot bridges to cross the main street at several high-traffic areas.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Mêfit-mëcê Basin was struck by a drought when Mere Chatri grew too small to continue feeding Waterway Narrow, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Thorley Citidel. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Thorley Citidel lost 294 people, and 271 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 5 weeks, which are remembered as the Heartache Thirst.</p>

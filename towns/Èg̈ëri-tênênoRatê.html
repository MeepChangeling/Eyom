<p>The name Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Taran2vj9d70s2y.html">Taran</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê covers an area of nearly 63 km<sup>2</sup> (25 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5868 m (19251 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1404, by Taran. The establishment of Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Taran electing to pay people to resettle in Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê.</p>
<p>Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê is is constructed  arround a series of broad paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The budget focused millitary grade defenses have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Èg̈ëri-tênêno Ratê long.</p>

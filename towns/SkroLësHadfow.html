<p>The name Skro Lës Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Skro Lës Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Helèail1vpytmu.html">Helè</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Skro Lës Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Skro Lës Hadfow receives an average of 84 cm/y (33 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Skro Lës Hadfow covers an area of nearly 68 km<sup>2</sup> (27 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4314 m (14153 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Skro Lës Hadfow was founded durring the late 17th century in late spring of the year 1572, by Helè. The establishment of Skro Lës Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Helè struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Skro Lës Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Skro Lës Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Skro Lës Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Skro Lës Hadfow is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive gravel streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Skro Lës Hadfow's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Looking around Skro Lës Hadfow you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions.

<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Skro Lës Hadfow's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

<p>Êpío-tebê Bî (/ˈɘp˔o/ /ˈtebɘ/ [blur] [paragraph; clause]) is a subtropical Small Town located in the <a href="../provences/FêlqêfèZone.html">Fêlqêfè Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êpío-tebê Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Êpío-tebê Bî was founded by <a href="../people/DrirzukBrêgêbemithgzckir.html">Drirzuk Brêgêbe</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êpío-tebê Bî has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êpío-tebê Bî was founded durring the early 11th century, by Drirzuk Brêgêbe. The establishment of Êpío-tebê Bî was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Drirzuk Brêgêbe struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Êpío-tebê Bî as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Êpío-tebê Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êpío-tebê Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êpío-tebê Bî is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Êpío-tebê Bî was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt canals streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The town's exceptionaly well made fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the towns defences.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Êpío-tebê Bî. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Êpío-tebê Bî's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>In Êpío-tebê Bî hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Êpío-tebê Bî is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Êpío-tebê Bî has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Êpío-tebê Bî was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Êpío-tebê Bî lost 107 people, 319 livestock, and 98 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 109, when members of Êpío-tebê Bî's militia enacted an operation to train a group of civilians for a special clandestine operation. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with the defense of the port against a siege, which ended in defeat for Êpío-tebê Bî's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Êpío-tebê Bî's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

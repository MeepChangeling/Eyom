<p>The name Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Danielle3kqzn25muh.html">Danielle</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya receives an average of 253 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya covers an area of nearly 77 km<sup>2</sup> (30 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1316 m (4317 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1450, by Danielle. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Danielle.</p>
<p>Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow paverstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The monster and outlaw focused fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya lost 248 people, 251 livestock, and 93 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 43, when members of Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to extract assets from a strategic location under siege by the enemy. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Loyæqelà Boyî Gûchya's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

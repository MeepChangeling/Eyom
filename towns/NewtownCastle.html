<p>Newtown Castle (/ˈnuˌtaʊn/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SpellhamDutchy.html">Spellham Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/SifateKingdom.html">Sifate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Newtown Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Newtown Castle was founded by <a href="../people/SnuthoshParkins0zj4nj4awx.html">Snuthosh Parkins</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Newtown Castle has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Newtown Castle receives an average of 140 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Newtown Castle covers an area of nearly 59 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3672 m (12047 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Newtown Castle was founded durring the late 11th century, by Snuthosh Parkins. The establishment of Newtown Castle was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Snuthosh Parkins electing to pay people to resettle in Newtown Castle.</p>
<p>Newtown Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Newtown Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brick construction taking the shape of large simple gemometric shapes which ate then embelished with decorative features, but retain their simple shapes in spite of the added features such as pillars, faccaddes, and covered walkways. The blocky nature gives a general impression of extreem age, as if each structure has existed since time immemorial.</p>
<p>Newtown Castle is buildings are located arround a single restrictive baked earthen mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Newtown Castle's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Astonishigly, the budget oriented are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Newtown Castle is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Newtown Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Newtown Castle most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Newtown Castle is centered around a major pilgrimage site. This may be a religious location of importance to a major faith, or it may be a more secular institution that draws the traffic, like a famous academy or the remains of some wondrous ancient work. Considerable local tension likely exists over controlling the access to the site and maximizing the profits from foreign visitors.</p>
<p>Newtown Castle has a substantial mill pond located a short distance from town.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Newtown Castle was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Newtown Castle lost 290 people, 384 livestock, and 42 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 71, when members of Newtown Castle's militia enacted an operation to destroy a particular enemy prototype. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Newtown Castle's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Newtown Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Newtown Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

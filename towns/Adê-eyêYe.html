<p>Adê-eyê Ye (/ˈadɘ/ /ˈejɘ/ [heavy] [tail; ass (slang)]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/DêliêsaCounty.html">Dêliêsa County</a>, <a href="../provences/NarienleanShire.html">Narienlean Shire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Adê-eyê Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Adê-eyê Ye was founded by Heblu, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Adê-eyê Ye has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Adê-eyê Ye receives an average of 178 cm/y (70 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Adê-eyê Ye covers an area of nearly 337 km<sup>2</sup> (134 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1586 m (5203 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Adê-eyê Ye was founded durring the late 16th century in summer of the year 1497, by Heblu. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Adê-eyê Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Adê-eyê Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Adê-eyê Ye is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Adê-eyê Ye was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the premissive cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The riverside city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Adê-eyê Ye's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Adê-eyê Ye seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Adê-eyê Ye which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Adê-eyê Ye's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Adê-eyê Ye.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Adê-eyê Ye's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Adê-eyê Ye suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

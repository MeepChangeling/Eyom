<p>Deerdale (/dɪə/ /deɪl/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a tropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/RosecrystalDutchy.html">Rosecrystal Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/BaldockiaMargrave.html">Baldockia Margrave</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Deerdale is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Deerdale was founded by Byocthel Searle, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Deerdale has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F). Deerdale receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Deerdale covers an area of nearly 279 km<sup>2</sup> (111 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4828 m (15839 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Deerdale was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1183, by Byocthel Searle. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Byocthel Searle.</p>
<p>Deerdale was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Deerdale is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Deerdale is was constructed arround several crampt cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The riverside city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The millitarily questionable fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Looking around Deerdale you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Deerdale's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Deerdale.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\PorcupineGiant.html">Porcupine, Giant</a> near Deerdale are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Deerdale's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves drinking to channel Conjuration energies of tier 3 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Deerdale is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Deerdale used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Deerdale.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century  was struck by a great wind storm. A great funnel cloud itself touched down in Deerdale, bringing twisting winds which killed 221 people, 373 livestock, and 57 buildings in the disaster.. The disaster is generally remembered as the Howling Winds of Horror.</p>

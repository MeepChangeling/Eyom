<p>Átmip-osg Xluwuf (/ə˞tˈmip/ /osg/ [dirty] [battle]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WhïzdisgPrincipality.html">Whïzdisg Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Yastas.html">Yastas</a>.</p>
<p>The name Átmip-osg Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Átmip-osg Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Celenilf3zgnsnrz2.html">Celenil</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Átmip-osg Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of -2°C (29°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -27°C (-16°F). Átmip-osg Xluwuf receives an average of 159 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Átmip-osg Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 197 km<sup>2</sup> (78 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6310 m (20702 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Átmip-osg Xluwuf was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1448, by Celenil. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Celenil.</p>
<p>Átmip-osg Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Átmip-osg Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Átmip-osg Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a single restrictive flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Átmip-osg Xluwuf's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Átmip-osg Xluwuf has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Átmip-osg Xluwuf ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Átmip-osg Xluwuf is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Átmip-osg Xluwuf long.</p>

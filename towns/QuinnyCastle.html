<p>Quinny Castle (/quinny/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ShademeadowDutchy.html">Shademeadow Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/EmzadaKingdom.html">Emzada Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Quinny Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Quinny Castle was founded by <a href="../people/CarandolielGladstoneidswz8v6hh.html">Carandoliel Gladstone</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Quinny Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Quinny Castle receives an average of 159 cm/y (62 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Quinny Castle covers an area of nearly 196 km<sup>2</sup> (78 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4722 m (15492 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Quinny Castle was founded durring the early 16th century in winter of the year 1509, by Carandoliel Gladstone. The establishment of Quinny Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Quinny Castle's construction back out of the project. Carandoliel Gladstone pushed on reguardles, and Quinny Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Quinny Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Quinny Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Quinny Castle is buildings are arranged arround a single crampt cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Quinny Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Quinny Castle gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Quinny Castle was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Quinny Castle lost 252 people, 140 livestock, and 65 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 88, when members of Quinny Castle's militia enacted an operation to train a specific elites group for an upcoming operation. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Quinny Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Quinny Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

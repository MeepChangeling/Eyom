<p>Zě Yob Khæq (/job/ /xæq/ [solid; dense; sturdy; compact] [prison; jail]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ĂqinæbZone.html">Ăqinæb Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/Xa-658iaProvince.html">Xa-658ia Province</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Zě Yob Khæq is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Zě Yob Khæq was founded by Et-40h 'Marilyn' Brîrêg̈, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zě Yob Khæq has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Zě Yob Khæq receives an average of 209 cm/y (82 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Zě Yob Khæq covers an area of nearly 531 km<sup>2</sup> (212 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1182 m (3877 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zě Yob Khæq was founded durring the late 15th century in spring of the year 1375, by Et-40h 'Marilyn' Brîrêg̈. The establishment of Zě Yob Khæq  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Zě Yob Khæq's construction back out of the project. Et-40h 'Marilyn' Brîrêg̈ pushed on reguardles, and Zě Yob Khæq was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Zě Yob Khæq was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zě Yob Khæq is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Zě Yob Khæq is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive carved bedrock streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The lakeside city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Zě Yob Khæq's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual though effective defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Looking around Zě Yob Khæq you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Zě Yob Khæq's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Zě Yob Khæq's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

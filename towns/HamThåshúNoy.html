<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ham Thåshú Noy was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1204, by Tselî. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Ham Thåshú Noy was built using the conventions of Rosid durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ham Thåshú Noy is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ham Thåshú Noy is buildings are arranged arround a single broad cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Astonishigly, the exceptionaly well made fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Ham Thåshú Noy is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>

<p>Ham Thåshú Noy's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Ham Thåshú Noy was attacked by a group of nobles with their private armies. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ham Thåshú Noy lost 170 people, 156 livestock, and 57 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 213, when members of Ham Thåshú Noy's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemy mage.

The war is remembered in legend by Ham Thåshú Noy's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

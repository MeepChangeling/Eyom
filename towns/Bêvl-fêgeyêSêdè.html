<p>The name Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè was founded by <a href="../people/Bethan24x6yrr9ji.html">Bethan</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè receives an average of 79 cm/y (31 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè covers an area of nearly 53 km<sup>2</sup> (21 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5276 m (17309 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1237, by Bethan. The establishment of Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Bethan struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè is buildings are arranged arround a single spacious cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè’s streets.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè lost 258 people, 274 livestock, and 44 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 94, when members of Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè's militia enacted an operation to locate a specific influential figure. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a stalemate for Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Bêvl-fêgeyê Sêdè's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

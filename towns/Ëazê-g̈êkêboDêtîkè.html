<p>Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè (/ëˈazɘ/ /g̃ɘˈkɘbo/ [challenge] [square; cube]) is a subtropical Small Town located in the <a href="../provences/NëpimtrêsëZone.html">Nëpimtrêsë Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè was founded by <a href="../people/ShëîGarthêpîvr4lld1kf3b.html">Shëî Garthêpîv</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè receives an average of 233 cm/y (91 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4248 m (13937 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1125, by Shëî Garthêpîv. The establishment of Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè's construction back out of the project. Shëî Garthêpîv pushed on reguardles, and Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt packed earth streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the town's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The town's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is skipped in Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè.</p>

<p>Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves square dance to channel Augury energies of tier 3 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè's residents established a new industry (26985 % 6)+1 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè lost 252 people, 257 livestock, and 87 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 62, when members of Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè's militia enacted an operation to rescue a specific  hero from the enemy. The operation was complicated by at least some of the intelligence related to the operation was incorrect. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ëazê-g̈êkêbo Dêtîkè's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

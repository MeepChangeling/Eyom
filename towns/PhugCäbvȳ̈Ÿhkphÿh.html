<p>The name Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/Hebrealynmawxux7rjx.html">Hebrealyn</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1169, by Hebrealyn. The establishment of Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow paverstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's cost-cutting-focused defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Phug Cäbvȳ̈ Ÿhkphÿh long.</p>

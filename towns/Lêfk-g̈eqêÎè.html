<p>Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè (/sɪ̞v/ /ˈg̃eqɘ/ [sentence] [birth]) is a tropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NonerinlumeCounty.html">Nonerinlume County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè was founded by Důhits, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè receives an average of 242 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè covers an area of nearly 274 km<sup>2</sup> (109 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1140 m (3740 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè was founded durring the early 16th century in fall of the year 1524, by Důhits. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè is buildings are arranged within a network of premissive paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The cliffside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look arround Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè reveals an abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is long in Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Shredskin.html">Shredskin</a> near Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves line dance to channel Invocation energies of tier 1 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè’s streets.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè was attacked by a slaver gang capable of fielding large forces. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè lost 257 people, 198 livestock, and 48 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 46, when members of Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè's militia enacted an operation to locate a particular irregulars group. The operation was complicated by extremely hostile wildlife which took many out of action. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lêfk-g̈eqê Îè's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

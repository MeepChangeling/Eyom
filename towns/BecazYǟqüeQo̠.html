<p>Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ (/ˈbecaz/ /jaːq˔/ [guilty] [poem; lyrics]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/VremōfzboParish.html">Vremōfzbo Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/ShanDeanery.html">Shan Deanery</a>, within the <a href="../nations/CovenentofIrus.html">Covenent of Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ was founded by <a href="../people/TrieshCriebolri9b58n12hcf.html">Triesh Criebolri</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ receives an average of 192 cm/y (75 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ covers an area of nearly 273 km<sup>2</sup> (109 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4890 m (16043 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ was founded durring the late 18th century in late spring of the year 1699, by Triesh Criebolri. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Triesh Criebolri.</p>
<p>Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the late 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ is buildings have been located at convienant points along the swamp Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the broad flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠'s walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠'s unusual though effective defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠'s garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is short in Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ is still bloodied by a recent violent conflict. A crushing bandit raid, a lost siege, getting caught at the periphery of a major battle, or some other calamity has inflicted severe damage on the place. Some communities may suffer a longer-term version of this, their youths lost in a grinding, endless battle against some perpetual threat.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> solved a major long term problem plaguing the town. Becaz Yǟqüe Qo̠ created a local delicacy in 's honor which is served at festivals.</p>

<p>Lynmond (/lyn/ /mond/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ShadewinterDutchy.html">Shadewinter Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/WodburiaCounty.html">Wodburia County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lynmond is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lynmond was founded by Lenna Carr, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lynmond has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Lynmond receives an average of 146 cm/y (57 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Lynmond covers an area of nearly 267 km<sup>2</sup> (106 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2304 m (7559 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lynmond was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1147, by Lenna Carr. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Lenna Carr.</p>
<p>Lynmond was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lynmond is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Lynmond is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The valley city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Lynmond, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Lynmond shows Lynmond as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Lynmond places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Lynmond has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Lynmond's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Lynmond has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<p>Lynmond is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Lynmond's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Lynmond.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Dlurgraven.html">Dlurgraven</a> near Lynmond are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Lynmond's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves bloodletting to channel Enchantment energies of tier 1 via guttural bellowing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Lynmond has access to some sort of functioning ancient infrastructure, whether it's an array of wall-mounted arcane energy projectors, running water, moving roadways, community-wide climate control, or some other inherited luxury. This infrastructure may be the result of a still-functional Working, or it could be the product of some venerable occult engine that's still operational, or it may be the fruit of the labors of some specially-designed organism or Blighted populace.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Lynmond is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Lynmond was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Lynmond lost 196 people, 290 livestock, and 83 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 183, when members of Lynmond's militia enacted an operation to eliminate a specific group of the enemy's forces. The operation was complicated by blistering heat, such that many succumbed to heatstroke. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the ruin, which ended in defeat for Lynmond's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Lynmond's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v (Spstíhz /ˈakʃɪ̞/ [illusion] [spirit; soul]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Qùkēi̊vRegion.html">Qùkēi̊v Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Ghrebengau7f9wt9ks.html">Ghrebeng</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 274 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2318 m (7604 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 11th century, by Ghrebeng. The establishment of Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's construction back out of the project. Ghrebeng pushed on reguardles, and Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Astonishigly, the unusual though effective defenses are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v is centered around a major pilgrimage site. This may be a religious location of importance to a major faith, or it may be a more secular institution that draws the traffic, like a famous academy or the remains of some wondrous ancient work. Considerable local tension likely exists over controlling the access to the site and maximizing the profits from foreign visitors.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v lost 146 people, 184 livestock, and 33 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 66, when members of Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific warchest to a particular production site unharmed. The operation was complicated by the militia had access to far less resources than expected. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Spstíhzakshíh Ji̊ Qi̊v's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

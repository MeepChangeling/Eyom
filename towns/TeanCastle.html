<p>Tean Castle (/tean/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/CoseaProvence.html">Cosea Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tean Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tean Castle was founded by <a href="../people/LucatelaRushj8wdx640kb.html">Lucatela Rush</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tean Castle has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Tean Castle receives an average of 298 cm/y (117 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Tean Castle covers an area of nearly 76 km<sup>2</sup> (30 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 918 m (3011 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tean Castle was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1199, by Lucatela Rush. The establishment of Tean Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Lucatela Rush struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Tean Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Tean Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tean Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tean Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Tean Castle's cost-cutting-focused defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Tean Castle is like looking into a university’s plaza on the day before an exam. People rush about to-and-fro. Discarded scrolls and quills are dotted around  city. In spite of many locals discussing academic topics, there’s little sign of any organized groups for any of that talk. Infact, the city seems disordered in general with everything scattered helter skelter about.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Tean Castle's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used has a sleek, linear appearance with stylized, often geometric ornamentation. The primary facade of its buildings often featured a series of set backs that create a stepped outline. Low-relief decorative panels can be found at entrances, around windows, along roof edges or as string courses. It was best known for its use of smooth finish building materials such as stucco, concrete block, glazed brick or mosaic tile. Decorative details can incorporate various artistic or exotic motifs to suit the building's function or the architect's whim. Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>
<p>In Tean Castle there is always just enough rain to be annoying.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Lizard.html">Lizard</a> near Tean Castle are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Tean Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves sex to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 3 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Tean Castle was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Tean Castle lost 239 people, 310 livestock, and 47 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 127, when members of Tean Castle's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular irregulars group to a safe location. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the research site, which ended in victory for Tean Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Tean Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

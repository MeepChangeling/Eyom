<p>Gû Kâhe (/gʊ/ /ˈkɑhe/ [pink] [task]) is a subtropical Small Town located in <a href="../subprovences/GobatuDutchy.html">Gobatu Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/RamamaMâchyu̹Provence.html">Ramama Mâchyu̹ Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gû Kâhe is derived from the <a href="../languages/S̺uran.html">Wareneese</a> language, as Gû Kâhe was founded by <a href="../people/GlesmZeshegarê21avl6c9c5.html">Glesm Zeshegarê</a>, who was culturaly Wareneese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gû Kâhe has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Gû Kâhe receives an average of 135 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Gû Kâhe covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4686 m (15374 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gû Kâhe was founded durring the early 11th century, by Glesm Zeshegarê. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Glesm Zeshegarê.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe was built using the conventions of Wareneese durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gû Kâhe is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe is is constructed  arround a series of premissive flagstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  town resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Gû Kâhe's robustly designed timber walls has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Gû Kâhe has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Gû Kâhe long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Gû Kâhe has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Gû Kâhe.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe has a Department of Firefighters, which is responsible for organizing fire fighting efforts during a fire and enforcing local ordinances relating to fire safety.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Gû Kâhe's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Gû Kâhe's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Gû Kâhe all of the cats speak in a dead language.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\HerdAnimalElk(Megaloceros).html">Herd Animal, Elk (Megaloceros)</a> near Gû Kâhe are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Gû Kâhe's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves gestures to channel Augury energies of tier 2 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Gû Kâhe is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Gû Kâhe was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Gû Kâhe. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Gû Kâhe lost 190 people, 279 livestock, and 77 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 88, when members of Gû Kâhe's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about the enemy. The operation was complicated by extremely dangerous terrain, including unfamiliar and poisonous plants which many ate while foraging. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the temple, which ended in victory for Gû Kâhe's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Gû Kâhe's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

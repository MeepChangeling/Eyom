<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw (/vje/ /tæ̝w/ [smart; intelligent; clever] [path; track; road]) is a temperate Large Town located in the <a href="../provences/DrarkprutiPrincipality.html">Drarkpruti Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/City-stateofAcoli.html">City-state of Acoli</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mäpt Vje-tēw is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zräysian.html">Gnollish</a> language, as Mäpt Vje-tēw was founded by <a href="../people/DukdriginnvyimRoxlendnreysyrm9u7lqup.html">Dukdriginn vyim Roxlendnreys</a>, who was culturaly Gnollish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -14°C (7°F). Mäpt Vje-tēw receives an average of 253 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mäpt Vje-tēw covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5262 m (17263 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1521, by Dukdriginn vyim Roxlendnreys. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Dukdriginn vyim Roxlendnreys.</p>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw was built using the conventions of Gnollish durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mäpt Vje-tēw is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw is buildings are speckled and packed arround broad paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the town's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a town. The  town emploies a series of defencive earthworks, spikes, and fences to provide some protection against wild beasts and smaller groups of intelegent foes. The minimaly adiquite has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Mäpt Vje-tēw’s streets. A look around Mäpt Vje-tēw has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Mäpt Vje-tēw long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Mäpt Vje-tēw. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Mäpt Vje-tēw's parks.</p>

<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Mäpt Vje-tēw's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw's locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Mäpt Vje-tēw.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\IceElementalMedium.html">Ice Elemental, Medium</a> near Mäpt Vje-tēw are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Mäpt Vje-tēw's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves reenactments to channel Abjuration energies of tier 3 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Ye̜n-fëf Med (/je̜n/ /fɛf/ [receipt] [ring]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NethorSeneschalty.html">Nethor Seneschalty</a> of the <a href="../nations/ViceroyaltyofRosid.html">Viceroyalty of Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ye̜n-fëf Med is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Ye̜n-fëf Med was founded by Glel Martheeh, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ye̜n-fëf Med has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -2°C (29°F). Ye̜n-fëf Med receives an average of 153 cm/y (60 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ye̜n-fëf Med covers an area of nearly 270 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2360 m (7742 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ye̜n-fëf Med was founded durring the early 10th century, by Glel Martheeh. The establishment of Ye̜n-fëf Med suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ye̜n-fëf Med was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ye̜n-fëf Med is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ye̜n-fëf Med is is constructed  arround a series of crampt baked earthen mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The mountain city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Ye̜n-fëf Med, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ye̜n-fëf Med hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

Decorative features included domed rooves, arches, soaring spaces, and sumptuous decoration: marble columns and inlay, mosaics on the vaults, inlaid-stone pavements, and sometimes gold coffered ceilings.</p>
<p>In Ye̜n-fëf Med sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea (12757 % 6)+1 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Ye̜n-fëf Med was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Ye̜n-fëf Med. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ye̜n-fëf Med lost 291 people, 241 livestock, and 27 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 95, when members of Ye̜n-fëf Med's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular depot intact. The operation was complicated by extremely dangerous terrain, including unfamiliar and poisonous plants which many ate while foraging. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a crushing defeat for Ye̜n-fëf Med's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ye̜n-fëf Med's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

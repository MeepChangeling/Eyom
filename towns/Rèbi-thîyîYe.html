<p>Rèbi-thîyî Ye (/ˈrèbi/ /ˈʃɪjɪ/ [deliberate] [sequence; order]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/UlnoreCounty.html">Ulnore County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Rèbi-thîyî Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Rèbi-thîyî Ye was founded by Nīkī́̄̄̄ Réchīb 'Raven Bash' Rä̋nḱ Mé̄ Cúóchīr, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Rèbi-thîyî Ye has a yearly average temperature of 27°C (80°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Rèbi-thîyî Ye receives an average of 194 cm/y (76 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Rèbi-thîyî Ye covers an area of nearly 335 km<sup>2</sup> (134 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2028 m (6653 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rèbi-thîyî Ye was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1443, by Nīkī́̄̄̄ Réchīb 'Raven Bash' Rä̋nḱ Mé̄ Cúóchīr. The establishment of Rèbi-thîyî Ye suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Rèbi-thîyî Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rèbi-thîyî Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Rèbi-thîyî Ye is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of broad flagstone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The hillside city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Rèbi-thîyî Ye's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Rèbi-thîyî Ye gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Rèbi-thîyî Ye's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Rèbi-thîyî Ye is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> solved a major long term problem plaguing the town. A small order of knights was founded in 's honor, and bears his name to this day.</p>

<p>Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ˈfaqɪ̞g/ /j̼ev/ [locksmith] [personal]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/FyāsvkashhíhCounty.html">Fyāsvkashhíh County</a>, <a href="../provences/TarnàgProvence.html">Tarnàg Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Delvipo79hhg2gj62.html">Delvipo</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 204 km<sup>2</sup> (81 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3776 m (12388 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 18th century in late winter of the year 1765, by Delvipo. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Delvipo.</p>
<p>Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of broad cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v's monster and outlaw focused fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with.

<p>Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Faqíhgj̼ev Ji̊ Qi̊v rainbows form quite often above the Large City.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

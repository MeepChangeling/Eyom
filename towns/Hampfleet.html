<p>Hampfleet (/hamp/ /fliːt/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/JachyusuqinaDutchy.html">Jachyusuqina Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/NorwickShire.html">Norwick Shire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/NorwickPrincipality.html">Norwick Principality</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hampfleet is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hampfleet was founded by <a href="../people/RārCó̄bōHeavenSugarYórméōRä̋mp̪f̄Ha̋shPadden0m2hnszbnp.html">Rār Có̄bō 'Heaven Sugar' Yórméō Rä̋mp̪f̄ Ha̋sh Padden</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hampfleet has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Hampfleet receives an average of 288 cm/y (113 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Hampfleet covers an area of nearly 522 km<sup>2</sup> (208 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2350 m (7709 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hampfleet was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1129, by Rār Có̄bō 'Heaven Sugar' Yórméō Rä̋mp̪f̄ Ha̋sh Padden. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Rār Có̄bō 'Heaven Sugar' Yórméō Rä̋mp̪f̄ Ha̋sh Padden.</p>
<p>Hampfleet was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hampfleet is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hampfleet is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Hampfleet was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Hampfleet's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Unfortuantly, these top tier civilian fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Hampfleet has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Hampfleet suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Hampfleet long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Hampfleet is home to a distinct subculture, who are either the majority here or have the dominant positions in the community. Architecture, local laws, and social customs are all tuned to suit them, and they may not be particularly forgiving or friendly to the major culture of the region. Communities that are not outright independent usually make an arm's-length submission to a local lord.</p>
<p>Hampfleet's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Hampfleet rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Hampfleet's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Hampfleet suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

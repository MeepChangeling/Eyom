<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè (/mɘ/ /ˈëg̃ɘ/ [other; spare] [ham]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SirethlonCounty.html">Sirethlon County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mê-ëg̈ê Îè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mê-ëg̈ê Îè was founded by Dyêre, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Mê-ëg̈ê Îè receives an average of 132 cm/y (51 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Mê-ëg̈ê Îè covers an area of nearly 450 km<sup>2</sup> (180 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6204 m (20354 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1385, by Dyêre. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Dyêre.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mê-ëg̈ê Îè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè is buildings are built arround a single narrow paverstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The valley city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Mê-ëg̈ê Îè weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Unfortuantly, these budget focused millitary grade defenses are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mê-ëg̈ê Îè hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Mê-ëg̈ê Îè. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Mê-ëg̈ê Îè's parks.</p>

<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè has an Millitary Academy which trains military officers and specilists.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large City. Mê-ëg̈ê Îè's grid is powered by mana accumulators.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items. While not open to the public, the librarians and scholars employed by the library will assist anyone with their research needs, and wealthy individuals can purchase membership to access the library's materials themselves. In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Mê-ëg̈ê Îè's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>

<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Mê-ëg̈ê Îè the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\FleaGiant.html">Flea, Giant</a> near Mê-ëg̈ê Îè are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves gestures to channel Enchantment energies of tier 2 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Mê-ëg̈ê Îè is surrounded by dangerous terrain: miasmatic swamps, perilous crevasses, radioactive badlands, a pocket of or some other harmful topography.

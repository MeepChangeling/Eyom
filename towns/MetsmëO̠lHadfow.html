<p>The name Metsmë O̠l Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Metsmë O̠l Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Carlaapj81im2pn.html">Carla</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Metsmë O̠l Hadfow covers an area of nearly 196 km<sup>2</sup> (78 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4914 m (16122 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Metsmë O̠l Hadfow was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1370, by Carla. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Carla.</p>
<p>Metsmë O̠l Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Metsmë O̠l Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Metsmë O̠l Hadfow is was constructed arround several crampt paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Metsmë O̠l Hadfow's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Metsmë O̠l Hadfow's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Metsmë O̠l Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Metsmë O̠l Hadfow suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Metsmë O̠l Hadfow long.</p>

<p>Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä (/θɒ̋f/ /gɔ̋ːiː/ [fake] [instrument; appliance; equipment; apparatus]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Zǔlēmsaw̌frProvence.html">Zǔlēmsaw̌fr Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/GrivguisSruDhodmnv51nwu1.html">Grivguis Sru Dho</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 126 cm/y (49 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 107 km<sup>2</sup> (42 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3090 m (10137 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 11th century, by Grivguis Sru Dho. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Grivguis Sru Dho.</p>
<p>Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the broad packed earth streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>=In Tḩaw̋f Ga̋wy Ni̋ēkēä when drawing, it's impossible to draw an imperfect circle.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

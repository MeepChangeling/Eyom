<p>The name Noia Ëk Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Noia Ëk Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Dendromalis1vl6r1r2k7.html">Dendromalis</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Noia Ëk Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 13°C (55°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Noia Ëk Hadfow receives an average of 209 cm/y (82 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Noia Ëk Hadfow covers an area of nearly 94 km<sup>2</sup> (37 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2058 m (6751 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Noia Ëk Hadfow was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1409, by Dendromalis. The establishment of Noia Ëk Hadfow suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Noia Ëk Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Noia Ëk Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Noia Ëk Hadfow is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive packed earth mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Noia Ëk Hadfow's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Noia Ëk Hadfow's monster and outlaw focused fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Noia Ëk Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Noia Ëk Hadfow ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Noia Ëk Hadfow is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Noia Ëk Hadfow long.</p>

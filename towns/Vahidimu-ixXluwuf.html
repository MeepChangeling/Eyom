<p>The name Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Grèbêlq888ikuqt.html">Grèbê</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1068, by Grèbê. The establishment of Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf's construction back out of the project. Grèbê pushed on reguardles, and Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of narrow packed earth streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf lost 173 people, 125 livestock, and 45 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 152, when members of Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf's militia enacted an operation to assassinate an enemyinfluential figure. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Vahidimu-ix Xluwuf's forces.

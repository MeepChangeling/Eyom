<p>The name Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Ieuan1r7yvbgltt.html">Ieuan</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 102 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4066 m (13339 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ was founded durring the late 12th century in spring of the year 1056, by Ieuan. The establishment of Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ is buildings are speckled and packed arround premissive paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ lost 286 people, 186 livestock, and 64 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 123, when members of Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ's militia enacted an operation to gain control of a particular bridge. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Bædâhi Mârà Kâchyâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Doomville (/duːm/ /ville/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SherstedbuEarldom.html">Sherstedbu Earldom</a> of the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHobben.html">Kingdom of Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Doomville is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Doomville was founded by <a href="../people/GleshBarrettkll437l6mu.html">Glesh Barrett</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Doomville has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 20°C (68°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Doomville receives an average of 243 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Doomville covers an area of nearly 516 km<sup>2</sup> (206 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 870 m (2854 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Doomville was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1345, by Glesh Barrett. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Glesh Barrett.</p>
<p>Doomville was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Doomville is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Doomville is is constructed arround a semi-circular broad paverstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Doomville's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Doomville's monster and outlaw focused fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Doomville gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. Beneath this surface, the people of Doomville can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Doomville places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Doomville has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Doomville.

<p>Doomville has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Doomville has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.</p>
<p>Doomville's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Doomville.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Plant-ImbuedApe.html">Plant-Imbued Ape</a> near Doomville are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Doomville's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 3 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Doomville was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Doomville. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Doomville lost 259 people, 148 livestock, and 26 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 216, when members of Doomville's militia enacted an operation to escort a specific  general to a safe location. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the depot, which ended in a crushing defeat for Doomville's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Doomville's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

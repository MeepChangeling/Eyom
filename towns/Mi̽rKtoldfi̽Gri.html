<p>Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri (/mi̽r/ /ˈktoldfi̽/ [good; superb; wonderful; appropriate; nice; fine (okay); moral] [cartoon]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ZǟwkrǟstvoParish.html">Zǟwkrǟstvo Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/GduzqüeonDiocese.html">Gduzqüeon Diocese</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Irus.html">Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Phaeturairv86q371l.html">Phaetura</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri receives an average of 137 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri covers an area of nearly 96 km<sup>2</sup> (38 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6504 m (21338 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri was founded durring the early 17th century in late fall of the year 1633, by Phaetura. The establishment of Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri's construction back out of the project. Phaetura pushed on reguardles, and Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri is buildings are located arround a single broad paverstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>

<p>Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>

<p>Mi̽r Ktoldfi̽ Gri used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 3 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>

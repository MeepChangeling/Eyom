<p>The name Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Amdirbaradf3qkfwx119.html">Amdirbarad</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya receives an average of 176 cm/y (69 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya covers an area of nearly 119 km<sup>2</sup> (47 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3794 m (12447 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya was founded durring the late 17th century in early summer of the year 1593, by Amdirbarad. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Læchyâ àzu̹ Gûchya proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

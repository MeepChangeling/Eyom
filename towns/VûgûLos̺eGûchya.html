<p>Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya (/ˈvʊgʊ/ /ˈlos̺e/ [bad] [pumpkin]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/LoKarûPrincipality.html">Lo Karû Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Lallalo.html">Lallalo</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Tharngwen0q1bqcbwhd.html">Tharngwen</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 6°C (42°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant -12°C (11°F). Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya receives an average of 222 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya covers an area of nearly 107 km<sup>2</sup> (42 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5306 m (17408 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1356, by Tharngwen. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Tharngwen.</p>
<p>Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya is buildings are speckled and packed arround narrow flagstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The exceptionaly well made fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Mercane.html">Mercane</a> near Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves line dance to channel Enchantment energies of tier 2 via oratory performances.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with wealth for a year and a day. One of Vûgû Los̺e Gûchya's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<p>The name Siston Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Siston Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TrêmLongctu8x9bi4u.html">Trêm Long</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Siston Castle has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Siston Castle receives an average of 141 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Siston Castle covers an area of nearly 45 km<sup>2</sup> (18 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2432 m (7979 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Siston Castle was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1557, by Trêm Long. The establishment of Siston Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Siston Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Siston Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Siston Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Siston Castle is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt carved bedrock mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city sits comfortably behind a palisade wall complete with a timber gatehouse and battlments. Siston Castle's timber-based walls has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Siston Castle. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Siston Castle is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Siston Castle was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Siston Castle lost 261 people, 286 livestock, and 87 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 93, when members of Siston Castle's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular vault to a safe location. The operation was complicated by enemy spies who revealed the militia's plan. The conflict ended with the defense of the vault against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Siston Castle's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Siston Castle's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

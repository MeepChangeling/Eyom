<p>Mardlem Castle (/mardle/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GumadaProvence.html">Gumada Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mardlem Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Mardlem Castle was founded by <a href="../people/DwongrastrRobertshaw1j98z436qd.html">Dwongrastr Robertshaw</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mardlem Castle has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Mardlem Castle receives an average of 276 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Mardlem Castle covers an area of nearly 160 km<sup>2</sup> (64 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2580 m (8464 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mardlem Castle was founded durring the late 10th century, by Dwongrastr Robertshaw. The establishment of Mardlem Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Mardlem Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mardlem Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Mardlem Castle is is constructed  arround a series of broad flagstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Mardlem Castle's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Mardlem Castle's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mardlem Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Mardlem Castle is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>There’s a relatively new religion in Mardlem Castle which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.</p>
<p>Mardlem Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

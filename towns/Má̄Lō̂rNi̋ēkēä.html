<p>Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä (/mɛ̄/ /lʊ̂ɜː/ [extinct] [bullet]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GīmōthyǎvyRegion.html">Gīmōthyǎvy Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/GoblinTribes.html">Goblin Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The name Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/Vú̄boīCó̄̄bó̄̌BuzzVixenVúó̄̄Ya̋chīsCa̋nvēsVúńó̄sMbó̄shb27w7jb01f.html">Vú̄boī Có̄̄bó̄̌ 'Buzz Vixen' Vúó̄̄ Ya̋chīs Ca̋nvēs Vúńó̄s Mbó̄sh</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 10°C (50°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 219 cm/y (86 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 107 km<sup>2</sup> (42 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1210 m (3969 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 16th century in winter of the year 1462, by Vú̄boī Có̄̄bó̄̌ 'Buzz Vixen' Vúó̄̄ Ya̋chīs Ca̋nvēs Vúńó̄s Mbó̄sh. The establishment of Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä is buildings folow an organic layout of spacious cobblestone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Má̄ Lō̂r Ni̋ēkēä long.</p>

The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

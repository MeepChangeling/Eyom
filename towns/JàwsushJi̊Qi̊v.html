<p>Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v (/jəw/ /suʃ/ [barrel; drum] [simple]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Sti̊ci̊qRegion.html">Sti̊ci̊q Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Trreggutj3h86arnu.html">Trreggu</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 30°C (86°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a blistering 34°C (93°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 27°C (80°F). Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 261 cm/y (102 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 253 km<sup>2</sup> (101 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2070 m (6791 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 17th century in early summer of the year 1576, by Trreggu. The establishment of Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive flagstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<p>Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is short in Jàwsush Ji̊ Qi̊v.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

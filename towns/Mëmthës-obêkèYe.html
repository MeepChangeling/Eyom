<p>Mëmthës-obêkè Ye (/mɘ/ /oˈbɘkè/ [other; spare] [choice]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MyuegrothCounty.html">Myuegroth County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mëmthës-obêkè Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Mëmthës-obêkè Ye was founded by Golden Scarab Swarms, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mëmthës-obêkè Ye has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 17°C (62°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Mëmthës-obêkè Ye receives an average of 281 cm/y (110 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mëmthës-obêkè Ye covers an area of nearly 271 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1004 m (3293 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mëmthës-obêkè Ye was founded durring the late 17th century in early summer of the year 1567, by Golden Scarab Swarms. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Mëmthës-obêkè Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mëmthës-obêkè Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mëmthës-obêkè Ye is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad flagstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The valley city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Mëmthës-obêkè Ye weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The budget focused millitary grade defenses have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Mëmthës-obêkè Ye is like a look into a broken heart. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need. It’s not malicious. Heads are hung. Eyes are empty. Something truly horrible happened here once upon a time and the city never healed.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Mëmthës-obêkè Ye's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is long in Mëmthës-obêkè Ye.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Mëmthës-obêkè Ye was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Mëmthës-obêkè Ye. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Mëmthës-obêkè Ye lost 174 people, 299 livestock, and 37 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 123, when members of Mëmthës-obêkè Ye's militia enacted an operation to destroy or capture a particular enemy prototype. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Mëmthës-obêkè Ye's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Mëmthës-obêkè Ye's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

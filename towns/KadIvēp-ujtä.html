<p>Kad Ivēp-ujtä (/iˈvæ̝p/ /uʤˈtɑ/ [medical] [flag; banner]) is a temperate City located in the <a href="../provences/SlïrddámsPrincipality.html">Slïrddáms Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Cochi.html">Cochi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Ivēp-ujtä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Ivēp-ujtä was founded by <a href="../people/Theddulnjhpgx96w.html">Theddu</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Ivēp-ujtä has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -15°C (5°F). Kad Ivēp-ujtä receives an average of 248 cm/y (97 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the long winter months. Kad Ivēp-ujtä covers an area of nearly 49 km<sup>2</sup> (19 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4908 m (16102 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Ivēp-ujtä was founded durring the early 18th century in late winter of the year 1744, by Theddu. The establishment of Kad Ivēp-ujtä was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Theddu struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Kad Ivēp-ujtä as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Kad Ivēp-ujtä was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Ivēp-ujtä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Kad Ivēp-ujtä is is constructed  arround a series of narrow cobblestone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Kad Ivēp-ujtä's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Kad Ivēp-ujtä's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Ivēp-ujtä gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Ivēp-ujtä's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>

<p>Kad Ivēp-ujtä produces some wonderful cultural artifact or trains famous artists. The product might be some exceptional cloth, or artistic luxury good, or the scholarly fruits of a famous academy. Trained artists might be students of a particular school, or the apprentices of the current masters of a long artistic tradition who dwell here.</p>
<p>Kad Ivēp-ujtä's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Kad Ivēp-ujtä suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Kad Ivēp-ujtä was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kad Ivēp-ujtä lost 240 people, 224 livestock, and 77 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 48, when members of Kad Ivēp-ujtä's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular bridge to a safe location. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with the defense of the research site against a siege, which ended in victory for Kad Ivēp-ujtä's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kad Ivēp-ujtä's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

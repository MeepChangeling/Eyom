<p>The name Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê was founded by <a href="../people/Gêlëphqdb0slt9.html">Gêlë</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê receives an average of 175 cm/y (68 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê covers an area of nearly 15 km<sup>2</sup> (6 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6928 m (-20220 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê was founded durring the early 13th century in summer of the year 1219, by Gêlë. The establishment of Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê is was constructed arround several restrictive gravel mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê has an animal control department which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the control, impoundment, and disposition of animals.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê's parks.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê.</p>

<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Small City. Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê's grid is powered by a direct leyline tap.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê has a Guild of Roadworkers, who are responsible for maintaining the roadways and public paths within town. They also have the duty of enforcing all civil laws relating to the roadways.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is skipped in Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\BogStrider.html">Bog Strider</a> near Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves reenactments to channel Chronomancy energies of tier 1 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Êkèkê Jë-lêhëtê possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>

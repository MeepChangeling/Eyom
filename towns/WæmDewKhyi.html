<p>Wæm Dew Khyi (/dew/ /xji/ [awful; terrible] [gramophone]) is a subtropical Small Town located in <a href="../subprovences/QakhikaZone.html">Qakhika Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/JĭìlkìwvǐDistrict.html">Jĭìlkìwvǐ District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wæm Dew Khyi is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Wæm Dew Khyi was founded by <a href="../people/BírielZlêreshèja990uww3p8.html">Bíriel Zlêreshèj</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wæm Dew Khyi has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Wæm Dew Khyi receives an average of 230 cm/y (90 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Wæm Dew Khyi covers an area of nearly 3 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6078 m (19940 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wæm Dew Khyi was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1392, by Bíriel Zlêreshèj. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Bíriel Zlêreshèj.</p>
<p>Wæm Dew Khyi was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wæm Dew Khyi is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Wæm Dew Khyi is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive flagstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town is protected by a well-crafted cobblestone fence tall enough to provide adiquite cover for defenders to fire from, but no more than that. The town's frontieer-style defences are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the towns defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Wæm Dew Khyi hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Wæm Dew Khyi's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Wæm Dew Khyi sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\DogGoblin.html">Dog, Goblin</a> near Wæm Dew Khyi are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Wæm Dew Khyi's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves drinking to channel Truename Magic energies of tier 3 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Wæm Dew Khyi is uncommonly rich, not only for the gentry but for the common citizens as well. They may produce a valuable good, oversee precious resource extraction, have special economic favors from the ruler, or simply have inherited a vast body of infrastructure. Their neighbors likely view them with envy, and outside raiders and exploiters find them an ideal target.</p>
<p>Wæm Dew Khyi is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Wæm Dew Khyi was attacked by savage troglodytess living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Wæm Dew Khyi lost 167 people, 247 livestock, and 27 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 168, when members of Wæm Dew Khyi's militia enacted an operation to gain control of a particular temple. The operation was complicated by thick blankets of fog, which hid friend and foe alike. The conflict ended with the defense of the temple against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Wæm Dew Khyi's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Wæm Dew Khyi's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

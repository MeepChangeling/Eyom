<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p (/ji̘/ /j̼i̘p/ [wall; barrier; hurdle] [extreme; intense; radical]) is a subtropical Small City located in the <a href="../provences/HujdàjRegion.html">Hujdàj Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p was founded by <a href="../people/Breli4s6gu9mz71.html">Breli</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p covers an area of nearly 12 km<sup>2</sup> (4 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1390 m (4560 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1110, by Breli. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Breli.</p>
<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p is buildings are arranged within a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p the water is caffeinated.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Jack-o'-Lantern.html">Jack-o'-Lantern</a> near Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Transmutation energies of tier 2 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p has access to some sort of functioning ancient infrastructure, whether it's an array of wall-mounted arcane energy projectors, running water, moving roadways, community-wide climate control, or some other inherited luxury. This infrastructure may be the result of a still-functional Working, or it could be the product of some venerable occult engine that's still operational, or it may be the fruit of the labors of some specially-designed organism or Blighted populace.</p>
<p>Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p lost 200 people, 320 livestock, and 35 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 140, when members of Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Boke Iēi̊y̼i̊p's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Derry Castle (/ˈdɛri/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BellstonDutchy.html">Bellston Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/TuhateKingdom.html">Tuhate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Derry Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Derry Castle was founded by <a href="../people/BresíWatkins5u1v64h3ww.html">Bresí Watkins</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Derry Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 15°C (59°F). Derry Castle receives an average of 268 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Derry Castle covers an area of nearly 166 km<sup>2</sup> (66 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1244 m (4081 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Derry Castle was founded durring the early 10th century, by Bresí Watkins. The establishment of Derry Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Derry Castle's construction back out of the project. Bresí Watkins pushed on reguardles, and Derry Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Derry Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Derry Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Derry Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive flagstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Derry Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Derry Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Derry Castle every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Ronus.html">Ronus</a> near Derry Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Derry Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Illusion energies of tier 2 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Derry Castle used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 4 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>

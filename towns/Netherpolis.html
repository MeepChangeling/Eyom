<p>Netherpolis (/ˈnɛðə/ /ˈpɒlɪs/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/ShadewyvernDutchy.html">Shadewyvern Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/ShoverleyCounty.html">Shoverley County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Netherpolis is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Netherpolis was founded by <a href="../people/MocthëdOCawley555dps7y7g.html">Mocthëd O'Cawley</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Netherpolis has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Netherpolis receives an average of 168 cm/y (66 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Netherpolis covers an area of nearly 272 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4496 m (14750 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Netherpolis was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1547, by Mocthëd O'Cawley. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Mocthëd O'Cawley.</p>
<p>Netherpolis was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Netherpolis is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Netherpolis is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Netherpolis's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Netherpolis's unusual though effective defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Netherpolis has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Netherpolis long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Netherpolis's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is recurring in Netherpolis.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\StymphalianBird(BronzeBeak).html">Stymphalian Bird (Bronze Beak)</a> near Netherpolis are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Netherpolis's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves sex to channel Illusion energies of tier 3 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Netherpolis's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Netherpolis suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Netherpolis is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami granted the town a great harvest. One of Netherpolis's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

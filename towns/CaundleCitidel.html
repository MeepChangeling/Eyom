<p>Caundle Citidel (/caundle/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/GreymageDutchy.html">Greymage Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MidateKingdom.html">Midate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Caundle Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Caundle Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/Byog̈ilHaslemlcq9s1c1a5.html">Byog̈il Haslem</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Caundle Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Caundle Citidel receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Caundle Citidel covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3508 m (11509 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Caundle Citidel was founded durring the late 11th century, by Byog̈il Haslem. The establishment of Caundle Citidel was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Byog̈il Haslem struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Caundle Citidel as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Caundle Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Caundle Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Caundle Citidel is buildings are arranged within a network of spacious flagstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The robustly designed timber walls has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Caundle Citidel hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Caundle Citidel's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Caundle Citidel hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SpiderAssassin(Giant).html">Spider, Assassin (Giant)</a> near Caundle Citidel are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

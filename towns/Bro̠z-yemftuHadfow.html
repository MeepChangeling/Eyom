<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow was founded durring the late 18th century in late summer of the year 1754, by Binzyk. The establishment of Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow's construction back out of the project. Binzyk pushed on reguardles, and Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 18th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow is buildings have been located at convienant points along the dale Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow split-log ties streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Thêmê-dèthêkè Savannah was struck by a drought when Loch Volta grew too small to continue feeding Stream Nivermar, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Bro̠z-yemftu Hadfow lost 139 people, and 116 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 1 weeks, which are remembered as the Trepidation Thirst.</p>

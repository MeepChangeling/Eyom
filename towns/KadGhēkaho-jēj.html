<p>Kad Ghēkaho-jēj (/irr/ /jæ̝ʤ/ [fire] [pattern; style; fashion; kind; motif; constellation; stereotype]) is a temperate City located in the <a href="../provences/Vēkæ̈piijuwitluPrincipality.html">Vēkæ̈piijuwitlu Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Shayeli.html">Shayeli</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Ghēkaho-jēj is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Ghēkaho-jēj was founded by <a href="../people/Êrímfvzhh1211.html">Êrí</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Ghēkaho-jēj has a yearly average temperature of 1°C (33°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 6°C (42°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -4°C (25°F). Kad Ghēkaho-jēj receives an average of 207 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the long winter months. Kad Ghēkaho-jēj covers an area of nearly 39 km<sup>2</sup> (15 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2062 m (6765 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Ghēkaho-jēj was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1316, by Êrí. The establishment of Kad Ghēkaho-jēj  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Kad Ghēkaho-jēj's construction back out of the project. Êrí pushed on reguardles, and Kad Ghēkaho-jēj was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Kad Ghēkaho-jēj was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Ghēkaho-jēj is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kad Ghēkaho-jēj is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Astonishigly, the exceptionaly well made fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Ghēkaho-jēj has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kad Ghēkaho-jēj long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Kad Ghēkaho-jēj is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Kad Ghēkaho-jēj was attacked by savage tribes living nearby Kad Ghēkaho-jēj. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kad Ghēkaho-jēj lost 263 people, 265 livestock, and 42 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 85, when members of Kad Ghēkaho-jēj's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to another of their nation's army, then reinforce them. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a stalemate for Kad Ghēkaho-jēj's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kad Ghēkaho-jēj's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

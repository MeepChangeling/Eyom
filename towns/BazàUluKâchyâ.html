<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ (/ˈbazə/ /ˈulu/ [scale (skin of reptiles)] [nickname]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/AvûBoruCounty.html">Avû Boru County</a>, <a href="../provences/KàrûS̺æchyæProvence.html">Kàrû S̺æchyæ Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/ScarabBeetleSwarmdjkkckls9m.html">Scarab Beetle Swarm</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 13°C (55°F). Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ receives an average of 236 cm/y (92 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 173 km<sup>2</sup> (69 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 870 m (2854 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1118, by Scarab Beetle Swarm. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Scarab Beetle Swarm.</p>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ is buildings are arranged within a network of restrictive split-log ties streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>The city shows nothing out of the ordinary, at first glance. Then you start to notice all the small things. Each window has seven iron nails pounded into the sill. Every door has a sprig of holly overhead. Every well is branded with purity seals and runes to ward the contents. Everyone is carrying a small charm for safety or fortune, be it a rabbit’s foot, a horseshoe, or other little totems.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>

<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large City. Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ's grid is powered by a direct leyline tap.</p>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ has a library, which keeps a large collection of books, scrolls, and archives all manner of physical items. While not open to the public, the librarians and scholars employed by the library will assist anyone with their research needs, and wealthy individuals can purchase membership to access the library's materials themselves. In spite of being generally closed to the public, the library has a room with several Aether Linked devices available to the public during business hours.</p>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ is home to a University which provides higher education in a variety of fields, and also serves as a research institute for those same fields.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\TuataraGiant.html">Tuatara, Giant</a> near Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves square dance to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 3 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Keelrock Fields was struck by a drought when Pond Ithaca grew too small to continue feeding Stream Tillpawa, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Bazà Ulu Kâchyâ lost 186 people, and 140 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 5 weeks, which are remembered as the Terror Thirst.</p>

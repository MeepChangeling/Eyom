<p>The name Southpool Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Southpool Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/HëîvDanahyj9sfghhntb.html">Hëîv Danahy</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Southpool Citidel has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Southpool Citidel receives an average of 251 cm/y (98 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Southpool Citidel covers an area of nearly 173 km<sup>2</sup> (69 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3382 m (11095 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Southpool Citidel was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1422, by Hëîv Danahy. The establishment of Southpool Citidel was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Hëîv Danahy electing to pay people to resettle in Southpool Citidel.</p>
<p>Southpool Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Southpool Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Southpool Citidel is was constructed arround several premissive packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Southpool Citidel's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual though effective defenses has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Southpool Citidel gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. A second look around Southpool Citidel makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Southpool Citidel's locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Southpool Citidel's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Southpool Citidel snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

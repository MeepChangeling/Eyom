</div>
<p>Ugehopo (/u/ /geˈhopo/ [use] [economic]) is a temperate Town located in the <a href="../nations/expanse.html">expanse</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ugehopo is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ugehopo was founded by <a href="../people/RaycztrÿkeCåqcebackhugrwPithomxzabhkzv2k.html">Raycztrÿke Cåqcebackhu grw Pithom</a>, who was culturaly Ancient.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ugehopo has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Ugehopo receives an average of 281 cm/y (110 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Ugehopo covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 0 m (0 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ugehopo was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1125, by Raycztrÿke Cåqcebackhu grw Pithom. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Raycztrÿke Cåqcebackhu grw Pithom.</p>
<p>Ugehopo was built using the conventions of Ancient durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ugehopo is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Ugehopo is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive gravel streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town emploies a series of defencive earthworks, spikes, and fences to provide some protection against wild beasts and smaller groups of intelegent foes. The town's minimaly adiquite have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ugehopo hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Ugehopo is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Ugehopo possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Ugehopo has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Ugehopo.</p>
<p>Ugehopo has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Ugehopo has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Ugehopo has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Ugehopo's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Ugehopo possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Ugehopo has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.</p>
<p>Ugehopo has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ugehopo's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Ugehopo all of the cats speak in a dead language.</p>

<p>Ugehopo's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Elven High Magic energies of tier 1 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Ugehopo is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Ugehopo possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Ugehopo was struck by a devistating earthquake. The quake brought ruin to Ugehopo, which lost 183 people, 211 livestock, and 54 buildings in the earthquake. The day of the quake is remembered by many as Grieving's Day.</p>

<p>Spinster (/ˈspɪnstər/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large Town located in <a href="../subprovences/Hu̹zu̹beAdûKingdom.html">Hu̹zu̹be Adû Kingdom</a>, <a href="../provences/EmadaCounty.html">Emada County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Spinster is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Spinster was founded by <a href="../people/GelèbWarboyshcxqcacyjb.html">Gelèb Warboys</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Spinster has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Spinster receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Spinster covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5228 m (17152 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Spinster was founded durring the late 16th century in summer of the year 1473, by Gelèb Warboys. The establishment of Spinster  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Spinster's construction back out of the project. Gelèb Warboys pushed on reguardles, and Spinster was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Spinster was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Spinster is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Spinster is buildings have been located at convienant points along the swamp Spinster was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious packed earth streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  town is protected by a humble stone fence which is tall enough to provide adiquite cover for defenders to fire from, but no more than that. Unfortuantly, these peasent-grade are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Spinster hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Spinster has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Spinster. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Spinster's parks.</p>
<p>Spinster has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Spinster.</p>
<p>Spinster has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Spinster has a Guild of Nurses, which is tasked with caring for the elderly and infirm in accordance with local ordinances, religious values, and customs.</p>
<p>Spinster has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Spinster has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Spinster has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Spinster's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Spinster possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Large Town. Spinster's grid is powered by an arcane means.</p>
<p>Spinster's old civil lighting system was converted to Galvanic Lamps recently, and expanded to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Spinster has a first rate hospital which caters to anyone in need of long term medical care.</p>
<p>Spinster has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Spinster's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Spinster has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Spinster has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Spinster's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is skipped in Spinster.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Gianthissingcockroach.html">Giant hissing cockroach</a> near Spinster are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Spinster's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves embarking on a group pilgrimage to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 2 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

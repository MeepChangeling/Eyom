<p>Fort Cocklemore (/cocklemore/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/BlackmontDutchy.html">Blackmont Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MidateKingdom.html">Midate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Cocklemore is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Cocklemore was founded by <a href="../people/CāsMbōbDeluxIvoryHaw̄bHa̋ńnḱBé̄kīyBigdenghqmddfknd.html">Cās Mbōb 'Delux Ivory' Haw̄b Ha̋ńnḱ Bé̄kīy Bigden</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Cocklemore has a yearly average temperature of 11°C (51°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 3°C (37°F). Fort Cocklemore receives an average of 186 cm/y (73 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Fort Cocklemore covers an area of nearly 159 km<sup>2</sup> (63 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2828 m (9278 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Cocklemore was founded durring the late 11th century, by Cās Mbōb 'Delux Ivory' Haw̄b Ha̋ńnḱ Bé̄kīy Bigden. The establishment of Fort Cocklemore was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Cās Mbōb 'Delux Ivory' Haw̄b Ha̋ńnḱ Bé̄kīy Bigden electing to pay people to resettle in Fort Cocklemore.</p>
<p>Fort Cocklemore was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Cocklemore is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Fort Cocklemore is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Fort Cocklemore's millitarily questionable fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Fort Cocklemore has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Fort Cocklemore long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fort Cocklemore's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Fort Cocklemore most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Ghoul.html">Ghoul</a> near Fort Cocklemore are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Fort Cocklemore's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves sex to channel Charm energies of tier 2 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Nreys-dá Xluwuf, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Nreys-dá Xluwuf is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Nreys-dá Xluwuf was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nreys-dá Xluwuf lost 212 people, 240 livestock, and 26 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 135, when members of Nreys-dá Xluwuf's militia enacted an operation to break a siege of a particular bridge. The operation was complicated by one of the key objectives in the operation requiring sticking to a very strict and short time table. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Nreys-dá Xluwuf's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nreys-dá Xluwuf's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

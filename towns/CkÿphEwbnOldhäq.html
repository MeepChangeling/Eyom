<p>The name Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq was founded by <a href="../people/DyeshZÿhndtubqugbuhezpwg1nm9ulw.html">Dyesh Zÿhndtubqugbuhez</a>, who was culturaly Dwarvern.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq was founded durring the early 17th century in late fall of the year 1623, by Dyesh Zÿhndtubqugbuhez. The establishment of Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Dyesh Zÿhndtubqugbuhez electing to pay people to resettle in Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious baked earthen streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<p>Ckÿph Ewbn Oldhäq's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

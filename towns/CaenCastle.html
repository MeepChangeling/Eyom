<p>Caen Castle (/kæn/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small City located in <a href="../subprovences/CoredgeDutchy.html">Coredge Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/LoqulateKingdom.html">Loqulate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Caen Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Caen Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ÝatsiParrmph3izybfd.html">Ýatsi Parr</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Caen Castle has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Caen Castle receives an average of 86 cm/y (33 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Caen Castle covers an area of nearly 19 km<sup>2</sup> (7 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8978 m (-13494 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Caen Castle was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1332, by Ýatsi Parr. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Ýatsi Parr.</p>
<p>Caen Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Caen Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Caen Castle is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious packed earth streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a city of Caen Castle's size could have. Caen Castle's well-designed, yet cheep are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Caen Castle is like a look into a broken heart which long ago fell to corruption. There is no planning, no organization. Everyone here clearly goes about their own thing with little thought to anyone around them who isn’t selling something they need… unless of course, they would be an easy target for some robbery. The city has truly fallen to evil.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Caen Castle's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Caen Castle most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Ghoul.html">Ghoul</a> near Caen Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Caen Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves creating small tokens to channel Summoning energies of tier 2 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Caen Castle's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Castor Mountain, an iconic vista located neare Caen Castle, proved to be volcanic when the mountain erupted. The eruption was isolated to the area around Caen Castle, which was swallowed in ash, lava flows, and pyroclastic gasses. Caen Castle lost 240 people, 199 livestock, and 88 buildings in the disaster. The event is forever remembered as the Day of Calamity's Wrath.</p>

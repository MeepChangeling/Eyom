<p>Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind (/grejˈtind/ /tind/ [fertile] [shed]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GïtarejéPrincipality.html">Gïtarejé Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Nasdi.html">Nasdi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind was founded by <a href="../people/Lemtodeac0v3q5bkfq.html">Lemtodea</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind has a yearly average temperature of 3°C (37°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a freezing -3°C (27°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind receives an average of 252 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2068 m (6784 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind was founded durring the late 10th century, by Lemtodea. The establishment of Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind's construction back out of the project. Lemtodea pushed on reguardles, and Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt packed earth mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>
<p>In Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind tiny harmless tornadoes plague the town.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\WolfDire.html">Wolf, Dire</a> near Slæ̈rn Greītind-tind are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Räz Gewlfn Rogro is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Gewlfn Rogro was founded by <a href="../people/Yhzarthab5fu81dus.html">Yhzarth</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Räz Gewlfn Rogro has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F). Räz Gewlfn Rogro receives an average of 221 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Räz Gewlfn Rogro covers an area of nearly 145 km<sup>2</sup> (58 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 8484 m (-15115 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Gewlfn Rogro was founded durring the late 17th century in early winter of the year 1656, by Yhzarth. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Yhzarth.</p>
<p>Räz Gewlfn Rogro was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Gewlfn Rogro is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Räz Gewlfn Rogro is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Räz Gewlfn Rogro's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The political statment focused walls have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Räz Gewlfn Rogro has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Räz Gewlfn Rogro ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Räz Gewlfn Rogro as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>

<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>

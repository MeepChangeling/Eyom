<p>The name Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ was founded by <a href="../people/Mesopedia91ay40rm72.html">Mesopedia</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ receives an average of 146 cm/y (57 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ covers an area of nearly 208 km<sup>2</sup> (83 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4796 m (15734 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1261, by Mesopedia. The establishment of Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ's construction back out of the project. Mesopedia pushed on reguardles, and Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ is was constructed arround several broad paverstone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Astonishigly, the political statment focused walls are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Chyameya Lu̽ Has̺æ.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

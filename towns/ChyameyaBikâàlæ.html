<p>Chyameya Bikâ àlæ (/ˈbikɑ/ /ˈəlæ/ [summer] [banner]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/LakâKâziPrincipality.html">Lakâ Kâzi Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kakoray.html">Kakoray</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chyameya Bikâ àlæ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Bikâ àlæ was founded by <a href="../people/Tsëîf41y959ul1.html">Tsëî</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyameya Bikâ àlæ has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -11°C (13°F). Chyameya Bikâ àlæ receives an average of 222 cm/y (87 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Chyameya Bikâ àlæ covers an area of nearly 102 km<sup>2</sup> (40 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6472 m (21233 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Bikâ àlæ was founded durring the early 16th century in fall of the year 1506, by Tsëî. The establishment of Chyameya Bikâ àlæ suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Chyameya Bikâ àlæ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Bikâ àlæ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Chyameya Bikâ àlæ is was constructed arround several broad packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Chyameya Bikâ àlæ's Ragnarock-era relics are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Chyameya Bikâ àlæ seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Chyameya Bikâ àlæ the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>There’s more than one leader in Chyameya Bikâ àlæ, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>Chyameya Bikâ àlæ's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>=In Chyameya Bikâ àlæ when drawing, it's impossible to draw an imperfect circle.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

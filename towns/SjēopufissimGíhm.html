<p>Sjēopufissim Gíhm (Sjēopu /ˈfissim/ [foot] [leverage]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WizkèysèProvence.html">Wizkèysè Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sjēopufissim Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Sjēopufissim Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Kelë54xmszarht.html">Kelë</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sjēopufissim Gíhm has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Sjēopufissim Gíhm receives an average of 169 cm/y (66 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Sjēopufissim Gíhm covers an area of nearly 172 km<sup>2</sup> (68 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5884 m (19304 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sjēopufissim Gíhm was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1126, by Kelë. The establishment of Sjēopufissim Gíhm suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Sjēopufissim Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sjēopufissim Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Sjēopufissim Gíhm is was constructed arround several narrow cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The city's would-be-castle fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Sjēopufissim Gíhm has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Sjēopufissim Gíhm ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Sjēopufissim Gíhm as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 5 years has greatly spiked Sjēopufissim Gíhm's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Sjēopufissim Gíhm was attacked by savage harpiess living nearby. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Sjēopufissim Gíhm lost 177 people, 380 livestock, and 33 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 167, when members of Sjēopufissim Gíhm's militia enacted an operation to deliver supplies to a specific production site. The operation was complicated by a natural disaster interrupted the operation, shattering unit cohesion. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the bridge, which ended in a stalemate for Sjēopufissim Gíhm's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Sjēopufissim Gíhm's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

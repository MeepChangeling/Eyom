<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Gācteq was founded durring the early 10th century, by Vúchī Mp̪fé̄ 'Lianna Alina' Bërméch Sēb Cú̄ó̄y. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Vúchī Mp̪fé̄ 'Lianna Alina' Bërméch Sēb Cú̄ó̄y.</p>
<p>Boke Gācteq was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Gācteq is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Boke Gācteq is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious packed earth streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Boke Gācteq, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Gācteq gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. A second look around Boke Gācteq makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>

Chevrons, zigzags, and other geometrical motifs are common forms of ornament.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Boke Gācteq is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>Boke Gācteq is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a great windstorm struck Boke Gācteq. Its winds were so great they picked up unsecured objects and flung them with enough force to smash brick and skull alike. Buildings collapsed under the gale, burying countless people alive. The storm's devistation was focused on the area arround Boke Gācteq, which lost 262 people, 145, and 48 livestock in the disaster.. History remembers the strom as The Storm of Anguish.</p>

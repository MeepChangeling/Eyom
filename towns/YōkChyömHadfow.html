<p>The name Yōk Chyöm Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Yōk Chyöm Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Jendethy9at53b08w.html">Jendeth</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Yōk Chyöm Hadfow covers an area of nearly 113 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2196 m (7204 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Yōk Chyöm Hadfow was founded durring the early 14th century in spring of the year 1348, by Jendeth. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Jendeth.</p>
<p>Yōk Chyöm Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Yōk Chyöm Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Yōk Chyöm Hadfow is buildings are built arround a single premissive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Astonishigly, the exceptionaly well made fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>A look around Yōk Chyöm Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Yōk Chyöm Hadfow long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Yōk Chyöm Hadfow's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is short in Yōk Chyöm Hadfow.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Yōk Chyöm Hadfow is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Yōk Chyöm Hadfow was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Yōk Chyöm Hadfow lost 289 people, 100 livestock, and 40 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 90, when members of Yōk Chyöm Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific war machine to a particular prison unharmed. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with the defense of the prison against a siege, which ended in a stalemate for Yōk Chyöm Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Yōk Chyöm Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

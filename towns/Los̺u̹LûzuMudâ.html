<p>The name Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ was founded by Yó̄́ Sénvér 'Hamsy Snow' Jōkī Yä̌ Sé̄shī, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1223, by Yó̄́ Sénvér 'Hamsy Snow' Jōkī Yä̌ Sé̄shī. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious packed earth streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ's brittle defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ’s streets. A look around Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Los̺u̹ Lûzu Mudâ long.</p>

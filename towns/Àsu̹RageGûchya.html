<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1321, by Gnanvaihn. The establishment of Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Gnanvaihn electing to pay people to resettle in Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya.</p>
<p>Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Astonishigly, the exceptionaly well made fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking.

But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

<p>Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a great windstorm struck Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya. Its winds were so great they picked up unsecured objects and flung them with enough force to smash brick and skull alike. Buildings collapsed under the gale, burying countless people alive. The storm's devistation was focused on the area arround Àsu̹ Rage Gûchya, which lost 285 people, 248, and 49 livestock in the disaster.. History remembers the strom as The Storm of Ill Tides.</p>

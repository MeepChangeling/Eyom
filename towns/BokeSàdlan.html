<p>Boke Sàdlan (/səd/ /lan/ [hat] [polite]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KveviēidRegion.html">Kveviēid Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Sàdlan is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Sàdlan was founded by <a href="../people/Dukdriginn829bmpjjpu.html">Dukdriginn</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Sàdlan has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Boke Sàdlan receives an average of 141 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Boke Sàdlan covers an area of nearly 242 km<sup>2</sup> (96 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6128 m (20104 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Sàdlan was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1113, by Dukdriginn. The establishment of Boke Sàdlan was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Dukdriginn electing to pay people to resettle in Boke Sàdlan.</p>
<p>Boke Sàdlan was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Sàdlan is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Boke Sàdlan is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious paverstone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Boke Sàdlan, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Boke Sàdlan has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Boke Sàdlan suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Boke Sàdlan long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Boke Sàdlan has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.</p>
<p>Boke Sàdlan's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

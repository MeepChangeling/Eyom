<p>The name Kad Ghotaho-ghkent is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Ghotaho-ghkent was founded by <a href="../people/Glegadonka2sxjsw3raz.html">Glegadonka</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Ghotaho-ghkent was founded in time immemorial, reportedly some time durring the early 8th century, by Glegadonka. The establishment of Kad Ghotaho-ghkent suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Kad Ghotaho-ghkent was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 8th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Ghotaho-ghkent is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kad Ghotaho-ghkent is buildings folow an organic layout of restrictive flagstone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Kad Ghotaho-ghkent's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Ghotaho-ghkent has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kad Ghotaho-ghkent long.</p>

<p>The name Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz was founded by Wuri Raycztrÿke, who was culturaly Dwarvern.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz covers an area of nearly 273 km<sup>2</sup> (109 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4010 m (13156 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1375, by Wuri Raycztrÿke. The establishment of Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Wuri Raycztrÿke electing to pay people to resettle in Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz is is constructed  arround a series of broad paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The lakeside city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The failry decent fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ckÿph Ekyehäq Zehlz long.</p>

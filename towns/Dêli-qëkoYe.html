<p>Dêli-qëko Ye (/ˈdɘli/ /ˈqëko/ [sick; ill; unwell] [vent]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/HenilmaCounty.html">Henilma County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dêli-qëko Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Dêli-qëko Ye was founded by <a href="../people/Hêbcjzu480n8w.html">Hêb</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dêli-qëko Ye has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Dêli-qëko Ye receives an average of 288 cm/y (113 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Dêli-qëko Ye covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4278 m (14035 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dêli-qëko Ye was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1349, by Hêb. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Hêb.</p>
<p>Dêli-qëko Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dêli-qëko Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Dêli-qëko Ye is buildings have been located at convienant points along the pond Dêli-qëko Ye was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the broad packed earth streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Dêli-qëko Ye has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Dêli-qëko Ye’s streets. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as relaxing. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Dêli-qëko Ye's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Dêli-qëko Ye was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Dêli-qëko Ye. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Dêli-qëko Ye lost 194 people, 224 livestock, and 61 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 36, when members of Dêli-qëko Ye's militia enacted an operation to escort a particular ruin to a safe location. The operation was complicated by extremely dangerous terrain, including unfamiliar and poisonous plants which many ate while foraging. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the ruin, which ended in defeat for Dêli-qëko Ye's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Dêli-qëko Ye's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Tsë Hid Hadfow (/tsɛ/ /hid/ [tan] [forefather]) is a temperate City located in the <a href="../provences/SkruvnōkMoot.html">Skruvnōk Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tsë Hid Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tsë Hid Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Galenasseth7z45vrwbli.html">Galenasseth</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tsë Hid Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -6°C (22°F). Tsë Hid Hadfow receives an average of 169 cm/y (66 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Tsë Hid Hadfow covers an area of nearly 30 km<sup>2</sup> (12 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1842 m (6043 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tsë Hid Hadfow was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1248, by Galenasseth. The establishment of Tsë Hid Hadfow was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Galenasseth struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Tsë Hid Hadfow as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Tsë Hid Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tsë Hid Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Tsë Hid Hadfow is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of crampt baked earthen streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Tsë Hid Hadfow's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Tsë Hid Hadfow has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Tsë Hid Hadfow long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Tsë Hid Hadfow's locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Tsë Hid Hadfow's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

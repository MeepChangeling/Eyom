<p>The name Dour Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Dour Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TshêvRickardpdrl3l21kq.html">Tshêv Rickard</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dour Castle was founded durring the early 12th century in winter of the year 1123, by Tshêv Rickard. The establishment of Dour Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Dour Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Dour Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dour Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Dour Castle is is constructed  arround a series of crampt cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Dour Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Dour Castle's Relic of the World That Was are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look arround Dour Castle reveals an abundance of schools, libraries, and other academic structures.

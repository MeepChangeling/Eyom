<p>The name Năz Wăkh Jĭăn is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Năz Wăkh Jĭăn was founded by <a href="../people/Gärmë̋chCú̄̄̋gKylieLissoMä̌shīCoú̄shMé̄́y45vpgqgsg.html">Gärmë̋ch Cú̄̄̋g 'Kylie Lisso' Mä̌shī Coú̄sh Mé̄́</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Năz Wăkh Jĭăn was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1276, by Gärmë̋ch Cú̄̄̋g 'Kylie Lisso' Mä̌shī Coú̄sh Mé̄́. The establishment of Năz Wăkh Jĭăn  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Năz Wăkh Jĭăn's construction back out of the project. Gärmë̋ch Cú̄̄̋g 'Kylie Lisso' Mä̌shī Coú̄sh Mé̄́ pushed on reguardles, and Năz Wăkh Jĭăn was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Năz Wăkh Jĭăn was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Năz Wăkh Jĭăn is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Năz Wăkh Jĭăn is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Năz Wăkh Jĭăn's cost-cutting-focused defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Năz Wăkh Jĭăn has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Năz Wăkh Jĭăn ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Năz Wăkh Jĭăn is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Năz Wăkh Jĭăn was like during the glorydays.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Năz Wăkh Jĭăn's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>In Năz Wăkh Jĭăn there is always just enough rain to be annoying.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Howler.html">Howler</a> near Năz Wăkh Jĭăn are known to be quite timid.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Năz Wăkh Jĭăn is uncommonly rich, not only for the gentry but for the common citizens as well. They may produce a valuable good, oversee precious resource extraction, have special economic favors from the ruler, or simply have inherited a vast body of infrastructure. Their neighbors likely view them with envy, and outside raiders and exploiters find them an ideal target.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Năz Wăkh Jĭăn was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Năz Wăkh Jĭăn lost 220 people, 181 livestock, and 42 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 76, when members of Năz Wăkh Jĭăn's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to a particular fortification, then reinforce it. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Năz Wăkh Jĭăn's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Năz Wăkh Jĭăn's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

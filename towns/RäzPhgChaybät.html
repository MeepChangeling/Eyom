<p>The name Räz Phg Chaybät is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Räz Phg Chaybät was founded by <a href="../people/Mrarxyrm71uf0hszx.html">Mrarxyr</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Räz Phg Chaybät has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Räz Phg Chaybät receives an average of 283 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Räz Phg Chaybät covers an area of nearly 50 km<sup>2</sup> (20 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2524 m (8280 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Räz Phg Chaybät was founded durring the early 17th century in early winter of the year 1626, by Mrarxyr. The establishment of Räz Phg Chaybät suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Räz Phg Chaybät was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Phg Chaybät is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Phg Chaybät is buildings are located arround a single broad cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. Astonishigly, the Ragnarock-era relics are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Räz Phg Chaybät hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Räz Phg Chaybät is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Räz Phg Chaybät's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In Räz Phg Chaybät there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Fort Moston is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Moston was founded by <a href="../people/KhrardjeaHaylenrj49xwxn0i.html">Khrardjea Haylen</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Moston was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1454, by Khrardjea Haylen. The establishment of Fort Moston suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Fort Moston which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Fort Moston was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Moston is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Fort Moston is is constructed  arround a series of premissive baked earthen mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, battlments, and even a moat, which are fashioned from stone and timber. Fort Moston's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual though effective defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fort Moston hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing.

More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Fort Moston was unknowingly built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.</p>

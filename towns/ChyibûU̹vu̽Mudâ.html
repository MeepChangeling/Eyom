<p>The name Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ was founded by Aglarchiw, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 2°C (35°F). Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ receives an average of 308 cm/y (121 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1307, by Aglarchiw. The establishment of Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ is buildings have been located at convienant points along the dale Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious gravel streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The valley city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The city's would-be-castle fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ long.</p>

<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ lost 194 people, 232 livestock, and 73 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 165, when members of Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ's militia enacted an operation to transport a specific powerful weapon to a particular temple unharmed. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with the defense of the temple against a siege, which ended in victory for Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Chyibû U̹vu̽ Mudâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

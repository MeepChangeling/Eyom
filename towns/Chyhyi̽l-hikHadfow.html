<p>Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow (/ci̽l/ /hik/ [cousin] [triangle]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/ZbëkfenfyëMoot.html">Zbëkfenfyë Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Kolvidhrjjm8gtzi.html">Kolvid</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -11°C (13°F). Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow receives an average of 153 cm/y (60 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow covers an area of nearly 119 km<sup>2</sup> (47 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4968 m (16299 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow was founded durring the early 17th century in early fall of the year 1633, by Kolvid. The establishment of Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow's construction back out of the project. Kolvid pushed on reguardles, and Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow is buildings have been located at convienant points along the lake Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the crampt flagstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all preforming the same rituals to bless and anoint building,s streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holysymbols is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This city certainly loves its god.</p>

<p>Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Chyhyi̽l-hik Hadfow's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>

Hu̽chyû Mære Gûchya covers an area of nearly 139 km<sup>2</sup> (55 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6046 m (19835 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hu̽chyû Mære Gûchya was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1520, by Tsèshî. The establishment of Hu̽chyû Mære Gûchya was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tsèshî struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Hu̽chyû Mære Gûchya as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Hu̽chyû Mære Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hu̽chyû Mære Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hu̽chyû Mære Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a single restrictive flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Hu̽chyû Mære Gûchya's cost-cutting-focused defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Hu̽chyû Mære Gûchya seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

<p>The name Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Èbêamxc6k70nr.html">Èbê</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -1°C (31°F). Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow receives an average of 153 cm/y (60 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow covers an area of nearly 121 km<sup>2</sup> (48 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4926 m (16161 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1238, by Èbê. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Èbê.</p>
<p>Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow is buildings are arranged within a network of narrow packed earth streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>

<p>Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow is home to some form of natural wonder. It could be a hot spring, or an especially enchanting glade, or a particular vista. Whatever it is, it's such a lovely attraction that Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow sees its fair share of tourists every year from all across Eyom. Consequently, its residents speak many languages at a functional level.</p>
<p>Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Gi̽ Zëm Hadfow suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

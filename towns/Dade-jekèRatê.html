<p>Dade-jekè Ratê (/ˈdade/ /ˈʤekè/ [custom] [thought]) is a subtropical City located in the <a href="../provences/LêtdêsaraZone.html">Lêtdêsara Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Dade-jekè Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Dade-jekè Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Manonph36qpj0yj.html">Manon</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Dade-jekè Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 24°C (75°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Dade-jekè Ratê was founded durring the early 14th century in summer of the year 1306, by Manon. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Manon.</p>
<p>Dade-jekè Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Dade-jekè Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Dade-jekè Ratê is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits comfortably behind a palisade wall complete with a timber gatehouse and battlments. Dade-jekè Ratê's timber-based walls are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Dade-jekè Ratê gives the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Dade-jekè Ratê brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Dade-jekè Ratê might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Dade-jekè Ratê's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape. The radiant colors, rich patterns, and symmetrical silhouettes employed by this style were backed up by rich decorative features including gardens, courtyards, extruded arches, domes, pointed domes, vaulted ceilings, elaborate painted and inlaid designs, and decorative sculptures.</p>
<p>In Dade-jekè Ratê there is always just enough rain to be annoying.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

The conflict ended after roughly 138, when members of Dade-jekè Ratê's militia enacted an operation to construct defenses in a particular fortification. The operation was complicated by major logistical problems. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the fortification, which ended in defeat for Dade-jekè Ratê's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Dade-jekè Ratê's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

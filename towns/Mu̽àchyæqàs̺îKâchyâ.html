<p>Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ (/ˈlɑha/ /ˌəcæˈqəs̺ɪː/ [basic] [sock]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QàdurûVu̽yûchûPrincipality.html">Qàdurû Vu̽yûchû Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kakoray.html">Kakoray</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Breshelas2mbgh6k.html">Breshe</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool -10°C (14°F). Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ receives an average of 232 cm/y (91 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ covers an area of nearly 77 km<sup>2</sup> (30 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4088 m (13412 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1504, by Breshe. The establishment of Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ's construction back out of the project. Breshe pushed on reguardles, and Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ is is constructed  arround a series of spacious baked earthen mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Unfortuantly, these exceptionaly well made fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ's locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. These locals have an active loathing, and the outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.</p>
<p>Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Gdës-flës Woods was struck by a drought when Tarn Issyk grew too small to continue feeding Creek Thundering, which reduced the available water supply nationwide, but was especially harsh in the area arround Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ. As the neighboring regions had no water so spare, Mu̽ àchyæqàs̺î Kâchyâ lost 143 people, and 130 livestock in the disaster.. The drought lasted for 6 weeks, which are remembered as the Torment Thirst.</p>

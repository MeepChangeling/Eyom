<p>Nogre Zov Gri (/ˈnogre/ /zov/ [golden] [hill; dune]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Ko̠ktugttöMoot.html">Ko̠ktugttö Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nogre Zov Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nogre Zov Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Felfuic2ti8ln04i.html">Felfui</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nogre Zov Gri has a yearly average temperature of 12°C (53°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -2°C (29°F). Nogre Zov Gri receives an average of 148 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Nogre Zov Gri covers an area of nearly 63 km<sup>2</sup> (25 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3826 m (12552 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nogre Zov Gri was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1260, by Felfui. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Felfui.</p>
<p>Nogre Zov Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nogre Zov Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nogre Zov Gri is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of broad packed earth streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. Unfortuantly, these millitarily questionable fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Nogre Zov Gri has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Nogre Zov Gri long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Nogre Zov Gri's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is long in Nogre Zov Gri.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Nogre Zov Gri's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Nogre Zov Gri suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

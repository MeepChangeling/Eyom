<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Los̺u̹ Gûchî was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1430, by Nrèsè. The establishment of Chyameya Los̺u̹ Gûchî was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Nrèsè electing to pay people to resettle in Chyameya Los̺u̹ Gûchî.</p>
<p>Chyameya Los̺u̹ Gûchî was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Los̺u̹ Gûchî is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Los̺u̹ Gûchî is is constructed  arround a series of premissive paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Chyameya Los̺u̹ Gûchî's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Unfortuantly, these top tier civilian fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>

People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

<p>The name Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ was founded by <a href="../people/Fyëmërvp1dy9kun.html">Fyëmë</a>, who was culturaly KLEO.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1202, by Fyëmë. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Fyëmë.</p>
<p>Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ was built using the conventions of KLEO durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ is is constructed  arround a series of crampt paverstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The city's millitarily questionable fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ long.</p>

The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.</p>
<p>Lilgap Kg-66h Bepyǐjĭ's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations.

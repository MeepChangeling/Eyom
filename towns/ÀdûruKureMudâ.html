<p>The name Àdûru Kure Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Àdûru Kure Mudâ was founded by <a href="../people/Phanos0va6lgt20h.html">Phanos</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Àdûru Kure Mudâ was founded durring the late 16th century in fall of the year 1481, by Phanos. The establishment of Àdûru Kure Mudâ suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Àdûru Kure Mudâ which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Àdûru Kure Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Àdûru Kure Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Àdûru Kure Mudâ is buildings are arranged arround a single crampt flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Àdûru Kure Mudâ's exceptionaly well made fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Àdûru Kure Mudâ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Àdûru Kure Mudâ ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The people are clearly worried about something, and everyone is either wearing a weapon or has one close at hand. Your gut tells you it’s not mere fate which has caused this town to begin failing...</p>

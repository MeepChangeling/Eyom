<p>The name Söd Se̜ Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Söd Se̜ Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Da̋chī̌YoúnvēsRobinTeenMä̂férCú̄ń̄̋mMēb̪fēnḱw9fl3upa63.html">Da̋chī̌ Yoúnvēs 'Robin Teen' Mä̂fér Cú̄ń̄̋m Mēb̪fēnḱ</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Söd Se̜ Hadfow was founded durring the late 13th century in fall of the year 1154, by Da̋chī̌ Yoúnvēs 'Robin Teen' Mä̂fér Cú̄ń̄̋m Mēb̪fēnḱ. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Da̋chī̌ Yoúnvēs 'Robin Teen' Mä̂fér Cú̄ń̄̋m Mēb̪fēnḱ.</p>
<p>Söd Se̜ Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Söd Se̜ Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Söd Se̜ Hadfow is buildings have been located at convienant points along the swamp Söd Se̜ Hadfow was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. The exceptionaly well made fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Söd Se̜ Hadfow. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>

The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision.

<p>The name Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/Lahgo166fx5tgnm.html">Lahgo</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the late 9th century, by Lahgo. The establishment of Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh's construction back out of the project. Lahgo pushed on reguardles, and Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh is was constructed arround several spacious packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Astonishigly, the would-be-castle fortifications are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Looking around Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>In Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh sometimes, near one of the seasonal solstices, the sun appears to split into three and it rains from a clear sky for several hours.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Äct Yenÿ Ÿhkphÿh is still bloodied by a recent violent conflict. A crushing bandit raid, a lost siege, getting caught at the periphery of a major battle, or some other calamity has inflicted severe damage on the place. Some communities may suffer a longer-term version of this, their youths lost in a grinding, endless battle against some perpetual threat.</p>

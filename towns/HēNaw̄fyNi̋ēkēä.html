<p>The name Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/GadsmthëDyegaTsîrígjh0vfu3vq.html">Gadsmthë Dyega Tsîrí</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 268 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 134 km<sup>2</sup> (53 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3784 m (12414 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1399, by Gadsmthë Dyega Tsîrí. The establishment of Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä's construction back out of the project. Gadsmthë Dyega Tsîrí pushed on reguardles, and Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are built arround a single broad paverstone mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The city's budget oriented are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Something in your gut tells you that you may be unwelcome in Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä. The town seems like it’s not showing you the side of itself it would show to others. People mostly ignore your questions. Many folks ask you to leave their establishments, even before you’ve walked inside them. You should probably listen to them, as every time you’re asked to leave the person asking you to leave has referenced the town’s patron divine in some way. The little voice in the back of your mind that tells you when you’re in danger feels like it’s just glaring at you and muttering about how stupid you are for even remaining in town.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä's roads were poorly made when first laid.

The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 1 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with wealth for a year and a day. One of Hē Naw̄fy Ni̋ēkēä's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

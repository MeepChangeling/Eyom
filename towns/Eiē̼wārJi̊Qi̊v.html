<p>Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ej̼/ /wəˑr/ [mood; attitude] [persona]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KveviēidRegion.html">Kveviēid Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Kthèsî4k5balcpc1.html">Kthèsî</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 28°C (82°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 25°C (77°F). Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 243 cm/y (95 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 134 km<sup>2</sup> (53 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5112 m (16771 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1129, by Kthèsî. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Kthèsî.</p>
<p>Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged within a network of restrictive flagstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v long.</p>

<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Eiē̼wār Ji̊ Qi̊v since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay.

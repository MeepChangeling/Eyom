<p>The name Qamachi Bavi Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qamachi Bavi Mudâ was founded by Ffion, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qamachi Bavi Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 11°C (51°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 23°C (73°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qamachi Bavi Mudâ was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1208, by Ffion. The establishment of Qamachi Bavi Mudâ was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Ffion electing to pay people to resettle in Qamachi Bavi Mudâ.</p>
<p>Qamachi Bavi Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qamachi Bavi Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qamachi Bavi Mudâ is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow flagstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The lakeside city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The would-be-castle fortifications have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Qamachi Bavi Mudâ has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Qamachi Bavi Mudâ ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. The locals seem to have responded to their slow downfall by recreating Qamachi Bavi Mudâ as one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which the city brings to mind.</p>

<p>Tobî-kîqê Ye (/ˈtobɪ/ /ˈkɪqɘ/ [automatic] [wire; thread]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KarranCounty.html">Karran County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tobî-kîqê Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Tobî-kîqê Ye was founded by Tshêm, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tobî-kîqê Ye has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 19°C (66°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Tobî-kîqê Ye receives an average of 258 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Tobî-kîqê Ye covers an area of nearly 489 km<sup>2</sup> (195 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2764 m (9068 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tobî-kîqê Ye was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1236, by Tshêm. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Tobî-kîqê Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tobî-kîqê Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tobî-kîqê Ye is buildings are built arround a single premissive gravel mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The valley city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Tobî-kîqê Ye has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Tobî-kîqê Ye long.</p>

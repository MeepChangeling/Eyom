<p>Meyî-rayë Ye (/ˈmejɪ/ /ˈrajë/ [helmet] [ally]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Dore'eailonCounty.html">Dore'eailon County</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Meyî-rayë Ye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Meyî-rayë Ye was founded by Edlessel, who was culturaly Iron Elvish.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Meyî-rayë Ye has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Meyî-rayë Ye receives an average of 237 cm/y (93 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Meyî-rayë Ye covers an area of nearly 425 km<sup>2</sup> (170 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 11058 m (-6670 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Meyî-rayë Ye was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1084, by Edlessel. The establishment of Meyî-rayë Ye suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Meyî-rayë Ye which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Meyî-rayë Ye was built using the conventions of Iron Elvish durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Meyî-rayë Ye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Meyî-rayë Ye is buildings are located arround a single broad packed earth mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The hillside city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Meyî-rayë Ye's brittle defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Meyî-rayë Ye makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It’s a quiet city filled with closed scriptoriums, people quietly yet dejectedly reading in isolated places around town, and the occasional book laying in a heap of garbage.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Mere Hamisar began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which devastated , killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. An estimated  people,  livestock, and  buildings were lost to the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Ill Tides Wind.</p>

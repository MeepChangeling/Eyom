<p>Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè (/ˈtali/ /ˈθakë/ [best] [membrane]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/FîthdekîZone.html">Fîthdekî Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè was founded by <a href="../people/Alistanu2ahlawh9r.html">Alistan</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè has a yearly average temperature of 20°C (68°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè covers an area of nearly 73 km<sup>2</sup> (29 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1294 m (4245 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè was founded durring the late 14th century in winter of the year 1258, by Alistan. The establishment of Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The city's robustly designed timber walls have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè's citizens locals enjoy many vices and lustful appetites. They may have religious sanction for their deeds, or neighbors might trade with them for such things, or they could be followers of some ideology that blesses such pursuits. Their economy or their social organization is usually heavily reliant on such traffic, and to ensure its continuance they may have made bargains with various mortal and immortal powers.</p>
<p>Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè rain occurs in reverse with water pooling up from the earth then falling into the skies to from clouds, this unsettles every visitor that sees it.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè lost 152 people, 291 livestock, and 77 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 169, when members of Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè's militia enacted an operation to deliver supplies to a particular solgiers group. The operation was complicated by gale force winds which drowned out orders and hampered ranged combat. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Gëlëm-thakë Sêdè's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

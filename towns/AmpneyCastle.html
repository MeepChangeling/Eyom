<p>Ampney Castle (/ampney/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WeianRegion.html">Weian Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ampney Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ampney Castle was founded by <a href="../people/MlèbêmYouldent5zigfafjp.html">Mlèbêm Youlden</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ampney Castle has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Ampney Castle receives an average of 265 cm/y (104 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ampney Castle covers an area of nearly 90 km<sup>2</sup> (36 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3518 m (11541 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ampney Castle was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1297, by Mlèbêm Youlden. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Mlèbêm Youlden.</p>
<p>Ampney Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ampney Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Ampney Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of spacious paverstone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Ampney Castle weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Ampney Castle is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Ampney Castle they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>

The style used is inspired by the natural world, characterized by sinuous, sculptural, organic shapes, arches, curving lines, and sensual ornamentation.

Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, curved windows, and decorative trim work. .</p>

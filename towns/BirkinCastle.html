<p>Birkin Castle (/birkin/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NahanProvence.html">Nahan Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Birkin Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Birkin Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TregfèdoWrenScottjzjmqmq6vy.html">Tregfèdo Wren Scott</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Birkin Castle has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Birkin Castle receives an average of 281 cm/y (110 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Birkin Castle covers an area of nearly 107 km<sup>2</sup> (42 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4718 m (15479 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Birkin Castle was founded durring the late 13th century in summer of the year 1163, by Tregfèdo Wren Scott. The establishment of Birkin Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Birkin Castle's construction back out of the project. Tregfèdo Wren Scott pushed on reguardles, and Birkin Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Birkin Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Birkin Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Birkin Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Birkin Castle's brittle defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Birkin Castle seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Birkin Castle has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.</p>
<p>Birkin Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>In Birkin Castle leaves and flower petals never touch the ground.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

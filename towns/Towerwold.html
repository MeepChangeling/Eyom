<p>Towerwold (/towerwold/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/LorbrookDutchy.html">Lorbrook Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/IpoulanKingdom.html">Ipoulan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Towerwold is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Towerwold was founded by <a href="../people/ÈqthèdshBlinkhorngy4j9v23tj.html">Èqthèdsh Blinkhorn</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Towerwold has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Towerwold receives an average of 139 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Towerwold covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2458 m (8064 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Towerwold was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1249, by Èqthèdsh Blinkhorn. The establishment of Towerwold suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Towerwold was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Towerwold is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Towerwold is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive flagstone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Towerwold's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The town's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the town's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Towerwold gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. Beneath this surface, the people of Towerwold can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Towerwold places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Towerwold has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Towerwold. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Towerwold's parks.</p>
<p>Towerwold has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Towerwold.</p>
<p>Towerwold has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Towerwold has a Guild of Nurses, which is tasked with caring for the elderly and infirm in accordance with local ordinances, religious values, and customs.</p>
<p>Towerwold has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Towerwold has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Towerwold has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Towerwold's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Towerwold has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Towerwold's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Towerwold has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Towerwold has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Towerwold has a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.</p>
<p>Towerwold's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style. It was best known for its rough, unfinished surfaces, unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is long in Towerwold.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LeshyLeaf.html">Leshy, Leaf</a> near Towerwold are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Towerwold's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves creating small tokens to channel Invocation energies of tier 3 via moments of science.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Towerwold was attacked by soldiers from another nation, with orders to raid Towerwold. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Towerwold lost 245 people, 187 livestock, and 26 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 172, when members of Towerwold's militia enacted an operation to break a siege of a particular strategic location. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Towerwold's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Towerwold's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

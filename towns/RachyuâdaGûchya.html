<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rachyu âda Gûchya was founded durring the late 14th century in spring of the year 1278, by Lewys. The establishment of Rachyu âda Gûchya suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Rachyu âda Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rachyu âda Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Rachyu âda Gûchya is buildings folow an organic layout of narrow paverstone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Rachyu âda Gûchya, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Rachyu âda Gûchya's Relic of the World That Was are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Rachyu âda Gûchya is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>

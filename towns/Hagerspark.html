<p>The name Hagerspark is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hagerspark was founded by <a href="../people/GhrinshiyHamertonc8vf50tqui.html">Ghrinshiy Hamerton</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hagerspark has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Hagerspark receives an average of 136 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Hagerspark covers an area of nearly 266 km<sup>2</sup> (106 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6246 m (20492 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hagerspark was founded durring the early 12th century in fall of the year 1135, by Ghrinshiy Hamerton. The establishment of Hagerspark was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ghrinshiy Hamerton struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Hagerspark as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Hagerspark was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hagerspark is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hagerspark is buildings folow an organic layout of restrictive paverstone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Hagerspark has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Hagerspark ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

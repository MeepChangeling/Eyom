<p>The name Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Rrhithnort9sb6r192v.html">Rrhithnor</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1407, by Rrhithnor. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Rrhithnor.</p>
<p>Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. Unfortuantly, these perhapse unnessisarily well built defences are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with good fortune for a year and a day. One of Vu̽sâku Dâyû Gûchya's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

<p>The name Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Kimbleppa0bdx7hr.html">Kimble</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1090, by Kimble. The establishment of Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Kimble struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow flagstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with. This hate may spring from recent events, or it may be an inherited spite from old wrongs.</p>
<p>Fêzi-fêgeyê Ratê's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Nyriad Castle (/nadrid/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/Nō̌gyaw̄wēDutchy.html">Nō̌gyaw̄wē Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/DāmêvrKingdom.html">Dāmêvr Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nyriad Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Nyriad Castle was founded by <a href="../people/GarêpíSpackmaninm94nv1zx.html">Garêpí Spackman</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nyriad Castle has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 11°C (51°F). Nyriad Castle receives an average of 138 cm/y (54 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Nyriad Castle covers an area of nearly 33 km<sup>2</sup> (13 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3678 m (12066 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nyriad Castle was founded durring the late 14th century in fall of the year 1277, by Garêpí Spackman. The establishment of Nyriad Castle was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Garêpí Spackman struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Nyriad Castle as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Nyriad Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nyriad Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Nyriad Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of premissive cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Nyriad Castle's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Nyriad Castle gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. A second look around Nyriad Castle makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Nyriad Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is recurring in Nyriad Castle.</p>

<p>Nyriad Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves orgies to channel Summoning energies of tier 2 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Nyriad Castle's residents established a new industry 6 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>

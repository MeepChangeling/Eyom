<p>Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî (/ˈfèvi/ /dɘˈtofɪ/ [fake] [moisture]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Z̄upaguvZone.html">Z̄upaguv Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî was founded by <a href="../people/Szyshi2xvw0a3xvz.html">Szyshi</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî receives an average of 245 cm/y (96 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî covers an area of nearly 197 km<sup>2</sup> (78 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3184 m (10446 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1073, by Szyshi. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Szyshi.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî is is constructed  arround a series of broad flagstone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Êkèkê Fèvi-dêtofî ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Even with that as it is, everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or much of both. The town should be gone, not dying. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable.</p>

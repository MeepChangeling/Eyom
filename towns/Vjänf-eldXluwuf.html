<p>Vjänf-eld Xluwuf (/vjɑnf/ /eld/ [opposite] [sample; example; specimen]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/TemryontPrincipality.html">Temryont Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Soheque.html">Soheque</a>.</p>
<p>The name Vjänf-eld Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Vjänf-eld Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Treshe3pwlp5ugil.html">Treshe</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Vjänf-eld Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 0°C (32°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 20°C (68°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -20°C (-4°F). Vjänf-eld Xluwuf receives an average of 257 cm/y (101 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Vjänf-eld Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 203 km<sup>2</sup> (81 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1600 m (5249 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vjänf-eld Xluwuf was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1137, by Treshe. The establishment of Vjänf-eld Xluwuf was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Treshe struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Vjänf-eld Xluwuf as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Vjänf-eld Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vjänf-eld Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Vjänf-eld Xluwuf is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Vjänf-eld Xluwuf's cost-cutting-focused defences are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Vjänf-eld Xluwuf gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. This all rests atop the unmistakable impression the town is one of the strictest places imaginable. Everyone’s actions are clearly directed by laws they keep in heart and mind at all times. Orderly byond order is a phrase which Vjänf-eld Xluwuf brings to mind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Vjänf-eld Xluwuf has a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.</p>
<p>Vjänf-eld Xluwuf's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Räz Chehy Rewd was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1405, by Common Eurypterids. The establishment of Räz Chehy Rewd was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Common Eurypterids electing to pay people to resettle in Räz Chehy Rewd.</p>
<p>Räz Chehy Rewd was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Chehy Rewd is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Räz Chehy Rewd is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. The robustly designed timber walls have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Räz Chehy Rewd, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Räz Chehy Rewd's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is recurring in Räz Chehy Rewd.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Räz Chehy Rewd used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Räz Chehy Rewd.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Räz Chehy Rewd was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Räz Chehy Rewd lost 170 people, 317 livestock, and 49 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 101, when members of Räz Chehy Rewd's militia enacted an operation to patrol a specific area to dissuade the enemy from their current activities. The operation was complicated by the officer in charge of Räz Chehy Rewd's forces was incompetent, and issue many foolish and-or unprofessional orders. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a stalemate for Räz Chehy Rewd's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Räz Chehy Rewd's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

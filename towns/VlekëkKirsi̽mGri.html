<p>The name Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Bhocnodixz7ff0m950.html">Bhocnodi</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri receives an average of 75 cm/y (29 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri covers an area of nearly 198 km<sup>2</sup> (79 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5236 m (17178 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri was founded durring the early 10th century, by Bhocnodi. The establishment of Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Bhocnodi struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri is is constructed  arround a series of narrow paverstone mainstreets which form concentric circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to each other at varrious points. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>A look around Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Vlekëk Kirsi̽m Gri's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings.

Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>

<p>Kad Xelái-murk (/tmink/ /murk/ [small; little; short; low; miniature] [bully]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/DnánmanPrincipality.html">Dnánman Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Kakoray.html">Kakoray</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Xelái-murk is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Xelái-murk was founded by <a href="../people/Ihzehvydyh1yxph.html">Ihzeh</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Xelái-murk has a yearly average temperature of 5°C (41°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 2°C (35°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Kad Xelái-murk receives an average of 205 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Kad Xelái-murk covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2014 m (6607 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Xelái-murk was founded durring the early 9th century, by Ihzeh. The establishment of Kad Xelái-murk was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Ihzeh struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Kad Xelái-murk as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Kad Xelái-murk was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Xelái-murk is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Kad Xelái-murk is buildings are located arround a single restrictive cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Astonishigly, the robustly designed timber walls are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Kad Xelái-murk proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Kad Xelái-murk has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer's vengeful Working, an outraged god's wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. I(devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven't left for better lands).</p>
<p>Kad Xelái-murk is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Kad Xelái-murk was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kad Xelái-murk lost 195 people, 383 livestock, and 56 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 172, when members of Kad Xelái-murk's militia enacted an operation to capture a particular enemy war supplies intact. The operation was complicated by a key segment of the operation that deepened entirely on a stealth mission going perfectly. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Kad Xelái-murk's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kad Xelái-murk's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

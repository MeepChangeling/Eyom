<p>The name Hammer Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Hammer Castle was founded by <a href="../people/BreliTaylory9zrxy46qb.html">Breli Taylor</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hammer Castle has a yearly average temperature of 15°C (59°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F).

Hammer Castle covers an area of nearly 71 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7950 m (-16866 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hammer Castle was founded durring the late 11th century, by Breli Taylor. The establishment of Hammer Castle suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Hammer Castle which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Hammer Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hammer Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hammer Castle is buildings folow an organic layout of premissive baked earthen streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. Hammer Castle's failry decent fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A quick look in any direction shows Hammer Castle is filled with vices. There are many taverns, brothels are advertising their services on the streets, cardsharks are plying their illicit trade within public squairs, and every shop has at least three signs advertising various sales on goods. That alone wouldn’t be too noticeable, if it wasn’t just so omnipresent and overwhelmingly how the people of this city live. Or if the general public wasn’t so enthusiastically, openly, and merrily participating in these activities.</p>

<p>Hammer Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

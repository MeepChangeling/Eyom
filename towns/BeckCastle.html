<p>Beck Castle (/bɛk/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/GesiēinsuRegion.html">Gesiēinsu Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Beck Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Beck Castle was founded by <a href="../people/Ch́itsaSnooknlgs0jt68p.html">Ch́itsa Snook</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Beck Castle has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Beck Castle receives an average of 272 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Beck Castle covers an area of nearly 58 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3886 m (12749 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Beck Castle was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1215, by Ch́itsa Snook. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Beck Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Beck Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Beck Castle is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Beck Castle was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow paverstone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Beck Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Beck Castle seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

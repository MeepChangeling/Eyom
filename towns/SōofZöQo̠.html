<p>Sō of Zö Qo̠ ([root words not on file] [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Metropolis located in <a href="../subprovences/VrötyodmuParish.html">Vrötyodmu Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/ShanDeanery.html">Shan Deanery</a>, within the <a href="../nations/CovenentofIrus.html">Covenent of Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sō of Zö Qo̠ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Sō of Zö Qo̠ was founded by Eluba Mepera Thonco, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sō of Zö Qo̠ has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Sō of Zö Qo̠ receives an average of 143 cm/y (56 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Sō of Zö Qo̠ covers an area of nearly -134 km<sup>2</sup> (-53 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3608 m (11837 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sō of Zö Qo̠ was founded durring the early 16th century in spring of the year 1524, by Eluba Mepera Thonco. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Eluba Mepera Thonco.</p>
<p>Sō of Zö Qo̠ was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sō of Zö Qo̠ is no diffrent. The metropolis's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Sō of Zö Qo̠ is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow paverstone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The lakeside metropolis rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Sō of Zö Qo̠'s wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The political statment focused walls have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Sō of Zö Qo̠, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same god, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its god. More than it loves wealth. The metropolis is very clearly poor. Buildings are run down in ways that are not imeadiatly obvious. The people are a bit too thin. The market is very eager to sell to newcomers, but not so eager to buy from them. There’s also a general lack of the hum and buzz of healthy industry in Sō of Zö Qo̠.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Sō of Zö Qo̠'s town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Sō of Zö Qo̠ leaves and flower petals never touch the ground.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Sandman.html">Sandman</a> near Sō of Zö Qo̠ are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Sō of Zö Qo̠'s citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves ritual combat to channel Conjuration energies of tier 2 via throat chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Eyom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

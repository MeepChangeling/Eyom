<p>The name Thordik Citidel is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Thordik Citidel was founded by <a href="../people/RēbōGa̋mMunchBulletGä̋chvēCóń̄yDākīyCa̋chīVú̄̋Brook85a1sccttz.html">Rēbō Ga̋m 'Munch Bullet' Gä̋chvē Cóń̄y Dākīy Ca̋chī Vú̄̋ Brook</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Thordik Citidel was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1273, by Rēbō Ga̋m 'Munch Bullet' Gä̋chvē Cóń̄y Dākīy Ca̋chī Vú̄̋ Brook. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Rēbō Ga̋m 'Munch Bullet' Gä̋chvē Cóń̄y Dākīy Ca̋chī Vú̄̋ Brook.</p>
<p>Thordik Citidel was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Thordik Citidel is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Thordik Citidel is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive packed earth streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The city's failry decent fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Thordik Citidel has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Thordik Citidel ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Thordik Citidel is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Thordik Citidel long.</p>

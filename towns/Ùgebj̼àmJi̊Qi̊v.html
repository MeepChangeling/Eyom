<p>Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v (/ˈʊgeb/ /j̼əm/ [thesis] [general]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/NijhobbubRegion.html">Nijhobbub Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Shèjadb1yfk9ml.html">Shèj</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 272 cm/y (107 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 72 km<sup>2</sup> (28 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 830 m (2723 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 15th century in fall of the year 1381, by Shèj. The establishment of Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive canals streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The city's millitarily questionable fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up.</p>

It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>
<p>In Ùgebj̼àm Ji̊ Qi̊v hail is always enormous, yet harmlessly plinks off people, creatures, and structures.</p>

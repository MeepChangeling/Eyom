The valley city posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone.

<p>Gētḩ Thaw̌y Gaw̋lē's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>

The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Gētḩ Thaw̌y Gaw̋lē lost 145 people, 336 livestock, and 22 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 185, when members of Gētḩ Thaw̌y Gaw̋lē's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by extremely dangerous terrain, including unfamiliar and poisonous plants which many ate while foraging. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Gētḩ Thaw̌y Gaw̋lē's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Gētḩ Thaw̌y Gaw̋lē's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Counter's Castle (/ˈkaʊntərz/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SilvergoldDutchy.html">Silvergold Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/EmzadaKingdom.html">Emzada Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Counter's Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Counter's Castle was founded by <a href="../people/ThiliorilGoodgame49t24t1i4b.html">Thilioril Goodgame</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Counter's Castle has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Counter's Castle receives an average of 135 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Counter's Castle covers an area of nearly 55 km<sup>2</sup> (22 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4514 m (14809 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Counter's Castle was founded durring the early 12th century in spring of the year 1050, by Thilioril Goodgame. The establishment of Counter's Castle was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Thilioril Goodgame electing to pay people to resettle in Counter's Castle.</p>
<p>Counter's Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Counter's Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Counter's Castle is buildings are arranged within a network of restrictive split-log ties streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Astonishigly, the brittle defences are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Counter's Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The new wealth has created some worrying attitudes in many passers by, such that it’s clear new laws have recently been enacted and enforced with such extreme scrutiny the locals seem to be going about their day as if by clockwork.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

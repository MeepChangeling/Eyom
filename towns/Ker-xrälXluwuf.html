<p>Ker-xräl Xluwuf (/ker/ /xrɑl/ [coherent] [draft]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/WápkunjuPrincipality.html">Wápkunju Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Konei.html">Konei</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ker-xräl Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ker-xräl Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Snotsuihz7zrkx3zt60.html">Snotsuihz</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ker-xräl Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of -3°C (27°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -28°C (-18°F). Ker-xräl Xluwuf receives an average of 267 cm/y (105 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ker-xräl Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 149 km<sup>2</sup> (59 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3502 m (11489 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ker-xräl Xluwuf was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1209, by Snotsuihz. The establishment of Ker-xräl Xluwuf suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ker-xräl Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ker-xräl Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Ker-xräl Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Ker-xräl Xluwuf, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Ker-xräl Xluwuf has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Ker-xräl Xluwuf long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Ker-xräl Xluwuf is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pigheaded obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.</p>
<p>Ker-xräl Xluwuf's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>In Ker-xräl Xluwuf snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a great windstorm struck Ker-xräl Xluwuf. Its winds were so great they picked up unsecured objects and flung them with enough force to smash brick and skull alike. Buildings collapsed under the gale, burying countless people alive. The storm's devistation was focused on the area arround Ker-xräl Xluwuf, which lost 206 people, 358, and 62 livestock in the disaster.. History remembers the strom as The Storm of Mourning.</p>

<p>The name Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Taradq0mkd2zgjg.html">Tarad</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf was founded durring the early 13th century in winter of the year 1224, by Tarad. The establishment of Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tarad struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of narrow split-log ties streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf's brittle defences has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<p>Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf lost 117 people, 364 livestock, and 76 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 37, when members of Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf's militia enacted an operation to deliver a message to another of their nation's army, then reinforce them. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with the defense of the strategic location against a siege, which ended in victory for Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Slïsg-vnapki Xluwuf's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

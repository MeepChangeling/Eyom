<p>Kad Jospa-keq (/josˈpa/ /keq/ [bad] [crust]) is a temperate City located in the <a href="../provences/SlïrddámsPrincipality.html">Slïrddáms Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Cochi.html">Cochi</a>.</p>
<p>The name Kad Jospa-keq is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kad Jospa-keq was founded by <a href="../people/Gidi̊h́cm0cb65xa6.html">Gidi̊h́</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kad Jospa-keq has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -10°C (14°F). Kad Jospa-keq receives an average of 225 cm/y (88 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the brutaly long winter months. Kad Jospa-keq covers an area of nearly 36 km<sup>2</sup> (14 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4316 m (14160 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kad Jospa-keq was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1095, by Gidi̊h́. The establishment of Kad Jospa-keq was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Gidi̊h́ struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Kad Jospa-keq as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Kad Jospa-keq was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kad Jospa-keq is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kad Jospa-keq is buildings are arranged arround a network of premissive cobblestone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from querried stone. The wall is equipped with a full set of battlments but the nature of its construction methodology leaves it somewhat vulnerable to siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The cost-cutting-focused defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>A look around Kad Jospa-keq gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. Beneath this surface, the people of Kad Jospa-keq can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Kad Jospa-keq places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Kad Jospa-keq's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Kad Jospa-keq’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Kad Jospa-keq’s streets.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Kad Jospa-keq possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>

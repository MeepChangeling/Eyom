<p>The name Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh was founded by <a href="../people/HärVú̄shPinkTiaraVú̄kīnḱJó̄nḱGoīshmhudppcqfp.html">Här Vú̄sh 'Pink Tiara' Vú̄kīnḱ Jó̄nḱ Goīsh</a>, who was culturaly Undermountain.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh was founded durring the late 11th century, by Här Vú̄sh 'Pink Tiara' Vú̄kīnḱ Jó̄nḱ Goīsh. The establishment of Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh's budget oriented has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh’s streets.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh lost 221 people, 158 livestock, and 69 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 30, when members of Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh's militia enacted an operation to train a specific elites group for an upcoming operation. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with the defense of the port against a siege, which ended in victory for Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Väkfeḡ Cåb Ÿhkphÿh's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

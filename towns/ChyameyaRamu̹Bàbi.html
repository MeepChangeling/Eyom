<p>Chyameya Ramu̹ Bàbi was founded durring the late 14th century in summer of the year 1356, by Carys. The establishment of Chyameya Ramu̹ Bàbi was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Carys struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Chyameya Ramu̹ Bàbi as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Chyameya Ramu̹ Bàbi was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Ramu̹ Bàbi is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Chyameya Ramu̹ Bàbi is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive paverstone streets which form octogonal paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Unfortuantly, these would-be-castle fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Chyameya Ramu̹ Bàbi seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

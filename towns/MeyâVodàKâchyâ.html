<p>The name Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ was founded by <a href="../people/Galenasseth8sdls8tr3k.html">Galenasseth</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1163, by Galenasseth. The establishment of Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ's construction back out of the project. Galenasseth pushed on reguardles, and Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ shows Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ as a den of corruption. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is. The city has another layer to it as well. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual, or at least, faking it.</p>

<p>Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is which made use of the classical orders and mathematically precise ratios of height and width combined with a desire for symmetry, proportion, and harmony. It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types. Decorative features were seen as largely unnecessary as the sheer beauty of the structure itself was often close to art. However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ lost 135 people, 345 livestock, and 41 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 225, when members of Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ's militia enacted an operation to recruit a specific religious figure. The operation was complicated by extremely hostile wildlife which took many out of action. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Meyâ Vodà Kâchyâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

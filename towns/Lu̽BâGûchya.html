<p>The name Lu̽ Bâ Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lu̽ Bâ Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Gareshzf7cgrmt0d.html">Garesh</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lu̽ Bâ Gûchya was founded durring the late 11th century, by Garesh. The establishment of Lu̽ Bâ Gûchya was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Garesh struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Lu̽ Bâ Gûchya as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Lu̽ Bâ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lu̽ Bâ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Lu̽ Bâ Gûchya is buildings have been located at convienant points along the valley Lu̽ Bâ Gûchya was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the narrow baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The brittle defences has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>

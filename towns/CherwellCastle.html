<p>Cherwell Castle (/cherwell/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical City located in <a href="../subprovences/MistflowerDutchy.html">Mistflower Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MidateKingdom.html">Midate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Cherwell Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Cherwell Castle was founded by <a href="../people/FyêthèjBedserm9ka28zjjv.html">Fyêthèj Bedser</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Cherwell Castle has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 6°C (42°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Cherwell Castle receives an average of 205 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Cherwell Castle covers an area of nearly 41 km<sup>2</sup> (16 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2062 m (6765 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cherwell Castle was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1328, by Fyêthèj Bedser. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Cherwell Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cherwell Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Cherwell Castle is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. Cherwell Castle's brittle defences are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Cherwell Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Cherwell Castle might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Cherwell Castle's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Cherwell Castle.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Gianthissingcockroach.html">Giant hissing cockroach</a> near Cherwell Castle are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Cherwell Castle's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sex to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 2 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

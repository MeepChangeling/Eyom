<p>Freewilde (/friː/ /waɪld/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/NewfieldDutchy.html">Newfield Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/TindenorCounty.html">Tindenor County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Freewilde is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Freewilde was founded by <a href="../people/KeedduhlGardnermh9clq3y5j.html">Keedduhl Gardner</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Freewilde has a yearly average temperature of 19°C (66°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Freewilde receives an average of 239 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Freewilde covers an area of nearly 262 km<sup>2</sup> (104 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 694 m (2276 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Freewilde was founded durring the late 11th century, by Keedduhl Gardner. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Freewilde was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Freewilde is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Freewilde is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of crampt gravel streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Freewilde weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Freewilde has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Freewilde ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Freewilde is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Freewilde was like during the glorydays.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Freewilde's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>In Freewilde the water is caffeinated.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Shredskin.html">Shredskin</a> near Freewilde are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Freewilde's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves ritual combat to channel Transmutation energies of tier 1 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Freewilde is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Freewilde used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Freewilde.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Ill Tides Peak, an iconic vista located neare Freewilde, proved to be volcanic when the peak erupted. The eruption was isolated to the area around Freewilde, which was swallowed in ash, lava flows, and pyroclastic gasses. Freewilde lost 102 people, 296 livestock, and 24 buildings in the disaster. The event is forever remembered as the Day of Ill Tides's Wrath.</p>

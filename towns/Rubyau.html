<p>Rubyau (/ˈruːbi/ /ˌəʊ/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/SwynwallDutchy.html">Swynwall Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/KiveriaCounty.html">Kiveria County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Rubyau is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Rubyau was founded by Sēnḱ Ya̋nvé̄sh 'Dazzle Coco' Gärmé̄ Haw̄b Mp̪f̄y Bimpson, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Rubyau has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 5°C (41°F). Rubyau receives an average of 276 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Rubyau covers an area of nearly 443 km<sup>2</sup> (177 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2288 m (7506 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Rubyau was founded durring the late 16th century in summer of the year 1475, by Sēnḱ Ya̋nvé̄sh 'Dazzle Coco' Gärmé̄ Haw̄b Mp̪f̄y Bimpson. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Rubyau was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Rubyau is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Rubyau is buildings have been located at convienant points along the cliff Rubyau was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the restrictive baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The cliffside city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Rubyau weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Rubyau's budget focused millitary grade defenses has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Rubyau has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Rubyau long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Rubyau's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is based upon new and innovative technologies of construction and the idea that form should follow function. It was an embrace of minimalism and a rejection of ornament. The style became characterized by an emphasis on volume, asymmetrical compositions, and minimal ornamentation..</p>
<p>In Rubyau rainbows form quite often above the Large City.</p>

<p>Rubyau's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves destroying a prepared ritual vessel to channel Conjuration energies of tier 2 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Rubyau has a conflict with a neighboring community. This usually isn't part of a larger war, but is instead a personal animosity between them. It may be the community has suffered at their enemy's hands, or they may have been the ones applying the suffering. Constant low-level skirmishes and trouble making go on between the two.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century the Kami ended a drought plaguing Rubyau. One of Rubyau's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

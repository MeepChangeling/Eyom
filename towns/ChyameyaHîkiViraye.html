<p>Chyameya Hîki Viraye (/ˈhɪːki/ /viˈraje/ [best] [bruise]) is a temperate Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KûriMûzûPrincipality.html">Kûri Mûzû Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Lallalo.html">Lallalo</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chyameya Hîki Viraye is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chyameya Hîki Viraye was founded by <a href="../people/Treshèbm9dyas1q4bt.html">Treshèbm</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chyameya Hîki Viraye has a yearly average temperature of 4°C (39°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 22°C (71°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -13°C (9°F). Chyameya Hîki Viraye receives an average of 233 cm/y (91 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Chyameya Hîki Viraye covers an area of nearly 82 km<sup>2</sup> (32 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 5090 m (16699 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Hîki Viraye was founded durring the early 12th century in summer of the year 1048, by Treshèbm. The establishment of Chyameya Hîki Viraye  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Chyameya Hîki Viraye's construction back out of the project. Treshèbm pushed on reguardles, and Chyameya Hîki Viraye was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Chyameya Hîki Viraye was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Hîki Viraye is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Chyameya Hîki Viraye is buildings have been located at convienant points along the swamp Chyameya Hîki Viraye was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious cobblestone streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Astonishigly, the robustly designed timber walls are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Your first impression of Chyameya Hîki Viraye proves to be right on the money. This city is where the rebels chose to settle. Fashion trends are quite simply the opposite of what’s popular in the other nearby communities. THis trend extends everywhere. Things that should be black are white, what would normally be square is organically curved, and what is typically unthinkable for polite society is more than welcome in this public square. Up to the logical limits, of course. There’s no flaying someone alive to eat their skin going on, but the women are dressed a little immodestly, the men are a little more emotional, and the food is all overly complex and terrible.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Chyameya Hîki Viraye since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>The roads leading into Chyameya Hîki Viraye possess a great number of switchbacks. While designed for defense, they mostly wind up pissing everyone trying to take goods to town right the hell off.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Chyameya Hîki Viraye was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Chyameya Hîki Viraye lost 134 people, 306 livestock, and 51 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 82, when members of Chyameya Hîki Viraye's militia enacted an operation to locate a particular depot. The operation was complicated by freezing cold, such that the troops suffered frostbite. The conflict ended with the defense of the depot against a siege, which ended in defeat for Chyameya Hîki Viraye's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Chyameya Hîki Viraye's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka (/ˈsudre/ /ˈɪcɛ/ [busy] [fury]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/Dizijodez̄uZone.html">Dizijodez̄u Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/YăvajĭkǐkhDistrict.html">Yăvajĭkǐkh District</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka was founded by <a href="../people/BrîGadsmêj9xlltnldq.html">Brî Gadsmê</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 21°C (69°F). Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka receives an average of 216 cm/y (85 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6870 m (-20410 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka was founded durring the early 11th century, by Brî Gadsmê. The establishment of Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka's construction back out of the project. Brî Gadsmê pushed on reguardles, and Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka is was constructed arround several broad packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town is the proud owner of a properly designed set of renforced walls made from mighty querried stone blocks. Their construction and material choices would make a dwarf weap with joy, for each and every part of the elaborate fortifications are purly functional and robust well byond reason. Even nonexperts can tell the walls are an excelent defencive structure. Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka's exceptionaly well made fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scutteling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s everything together. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>
<p>In Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Skinstitch.html">Skinstitch</a> near Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Mysticism energies of tier 2 via singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka's residents established a new industry (1761 % 6)+1 years ago, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka lost 153 people, 334 livestock, and 60 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 96, when members of Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka's militia enacted an operation to deliver supplies to a specific research site. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the production site, which ended in a stalemate for Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Sudre Ǐcě Birěkhka's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

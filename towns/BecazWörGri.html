<p>Becaz Wör Gri (/ˈbecaz/ /wo˞r/ [guilty] [damage]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Gde̜ngwatyodMoot.html">Gde̜ngwatyod Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Becaz Wör Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Becaz Wör Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Dwuc6nnt9qp822.html">Dwuc</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Becaz Wör Gri has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -11°C (13°F). Becaz Wör Gri receives an average of 206 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Becaz Wör Gri covers an area of nearly 242 km<sup>2</sup> (96 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3976 m (13044 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Becaz Wör Gri was founded durring the late 13th century in spring of the year 1251, by Dwuc. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Becaz Wör Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Becaz Wör Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Becaz Wör Gri is buildings are speckled and packed arround spacious cobblestone streets with seemingly no patern to them. It appears as if the city's residents simply built streets as they pleased and squeazed buildings in wherever and howeave rpossible, creating an organic, frustrating to navigate, maze of a city. The  city rests behind a thick wall made from clay bricks. The wall has all of the proper fortifications and is well made. Unfortuantly the nature of clay brick leaves it quite vulnerable to siege equipment, though the thickness of the wall lends it simmilar resistnace to a thinner hardrock wall. The city's millitarily questionable fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Becaz Wör Gri has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Becaz Wör Gri ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Becaz Wör Gri has a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.</p>
<p>Becaz Wör Gri's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by order, symmetry, formal design, grandiosity, and elaborate ornamentation. Architectural characteristics include balustrades, balconies, columns, cornices, pilasters, and triangular pediments. Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. Interiors will often have a grand stairway and opulent ballroom..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Becaz Wör Gri.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

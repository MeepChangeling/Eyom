<p>The name Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/HärCä̋RegentGunslingerMpfēbónḱMb̪fēMërmVú̄kī̌shYoīy510052cszc.html">Här Cä̋ 'Regent Gunslinger' Mpfēbónḱ Mb̪fē Mërm Vú̄kī̌sh Yoīy</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 5°C (41°F). Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä receives an average of 303 cm/y (119 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 178 km<sup>2</sup> (71 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2856 m (9370 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 13th century in fall of the year 1205, by Här Cä̋ 'Regent Gunslinger' Mpfēbónḱ Mb̪fē Mërm Vú̄kī̌sh Yoīy. The establishment of Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Här Cä̋ 'Regent Gunslinger' Mpfēbónḱ Mb̪fē Mërm Vú̄kī̌sh Yoīy electing to pay people to resettle in Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä.</p>
<p>Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä's political statment focused walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä shows Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy. Birbes can be seen changing hands openly, such that it must be customary to do so and must have been for a long time. The locals have no fear, no annoyance at the state of things, it simply is.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, winter is long in Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Kamadan.html">Kamadan</a> near Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves creating small tokens to channel Enchantment energies of tier 3 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä lost 139 people, 301 livestock, and 94 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 88, when members of Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to locate a particular solgiers group. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a stalemate for Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ôrmy Mūē Ni̋ēkēä's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

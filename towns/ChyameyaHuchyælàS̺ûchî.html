<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1538, by Zlesëka. The establishment of Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî is buildings have been located at convienant points along the gorge Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the broad baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî gives you a feeling of distrust and paranoia. Also greed.

<p>Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> saved most of the town when a natural disaster struck Chyameya Huchyælà S̺ûchî.  was immortalized in song for this deed.</p>

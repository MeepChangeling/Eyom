<p>The name Zě Eg-23i Věpu is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Zě Eg-23i Věpu was founded by <a href="../people/TrruzhuiZlkèdocruntjycyn.html">Trruzhui Zlkèdo</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Zě Eg-23i Věpu covers an area of nearly 269 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1496 m (4908 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zě Eg-23i Věpu was founded durring the late 11th century, by Trruzhui Zlkèdo. The establishment of Zě Eg-23i Věpu suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Zě Eg-23i Věpu was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zě Eg-23i Věpu is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Zě Eg-23i Věpu is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow paverstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Zě Eg-23i Věpu's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. Unfortuantly, these budget oriented are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Zě Eg-23i Věpu hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The influx of wealth has brought with it an influx of relaxation. Everywhere you look people are enjoying their prosperity in a slow, casual, and deliberate manner. There’s no rush for anything anywhere you look.</p>

<p>Zě Eg-23i Věpu's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Many of Zě Eg-23i Věpu’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath Zě Eg-23i Věpu’s streets.</p>
<p>Zě Eg-23i Věpu's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Zě Eg-23i Věpu suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

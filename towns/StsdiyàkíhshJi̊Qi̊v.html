<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 11th century, by Treshêbe. The establishment of Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v's construction back out of the project. Treshêbe pushed on reguardles, and Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive paverstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city resides behind a palisade wall complete with battlments, a moat, and timber gatehouses with drawbridges. Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v's robustly designed timber walls are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p>Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Stsdiyàkíhsh Ji̊ Qi̊v suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>

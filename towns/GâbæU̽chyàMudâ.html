<p>The name Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ was founded by <a href="../people/ZeshêpíPemosadGhuldrash1wm6023rjv.html">Zeshêpí Pemosad Ghuldrash</a>, who was culturaly Warrenese.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1323, by Zeshêpí Pemosad Ghuldrash. The establishment of Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ's construction back out of the project. Zeshêpí Pemosad Ghuldrash pushed on reguardles, and Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ was built using the conventions of Warrenese durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of restrictive paverstone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. It’s easy to see where their wealth comes from the more you look arround. Every aspect of the city has been developed with care and great thought. The people themselves act deliberately and with care in even the simplest of daily actions.</p>

<p>Gâbæ U̽chyà Mudâ's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by towering round arches, massive stone and brickwork, small windows, thick walls, and a propensity for housing art and sculpture depicting mythological scenes. The building's general shape would be a clever and ascetic combination of geometric shapes, which would be blended together by joining elements. The style's decorative features were largely internal rather than external and incorporated semicircular arches for windows, doors, and arcades; barrel or groin vaults to support the roof of the nave; massive piers and walls, with few windows, to contain the outward thrust of the vaults; side aisles with galleries above them..</p>

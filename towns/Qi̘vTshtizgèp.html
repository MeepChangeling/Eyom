<p>Qi̘v Tshtizgèp (Tshtiz /gɛp/ [weak; fragile] [food; nutrition; cuisine]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Vāj̼sushCounty.html">Vāj̼sush County</a>, <a href="../provences/ChawbolesCouncil.html">Chawboles Council</a>, within the <a href="../nations/TauranianUnitedProvinces.html">Tauranian United Provinces</a>.</p>
<p>The name Qi̘v Tshtizgèp is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Qi̘v Tshtizgèp was founded by Amadeus Morgan, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Tshtizgèp has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 21°C (69°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 14°C (57°F). Qi̘v Tshtizgèp receives an average of 204 cm/y (80 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Qi̘v Tshtizgèp covers an area of nearly 267 km<sup>2</sup> (106 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1436 m (4711 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Tshtizgèp was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1090, by Amadeus Morgan. The establishment of Qi̘v Tshtizgèp was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Amadeus Morgan struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Qi̘v Tshtizgèp as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Tshtizgèp was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qi̘v Tshtizgèp is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Tshtizgèp is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of premissive flagstone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The byou city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Qi̘v Tshtizgèp's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. Qi̘v Tshtizgèp's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Qi̘v Tshtizgèp seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are smiling, quietly exchanging words with a friend, or simply enjoying the day as they work. It reminds you of an evening at home as everyone dined, having run out of things to talk about and embraced the savory meal before them.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qi̘v Tshtizgèp's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for its functional shapes, abstract shapes used sparingly for decor, simple color schemes, holistic design, and basic industrial materials. Its simple designs were created to be beautiful, functional, and mass-producible. The style used little to no embellishment or ornamentation, instead drawing attention to the streamlined design, such as flat roofs to create a simple, geometric look. The simplicity masks the style's nearly sinister functionality, as every last feature is designed to guide the people living in the building in how to make the most efficient use of the structure.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is long in Qi̘v Tshtizgèp.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>While private tutelage of worthy apprentices can be had even in most remote villages, Qi̘v Tshtizgèp is home to a proper school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Qi̘v Tshtizgèp was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Qi̘v Tshtizgèp lost 171 people, 394 livestock, and 21 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 78, when members of Qi̘v Tshtizgèp's militia enacted an operation to escort a specific  mage to a safe location. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a crushing defeat for Qi̘v Tshtizgèp's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Qi̘v Tshtizgèp's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

<p>Cefa-këyê Bî (/ˈcefa/ /ˈkëjɘ/ [instant] [side]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/MèbîfegeZone.html">Mèbîfege Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/UnionofEngineers.html">Union of Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>The name Cefa-këyê Bî is derived from the <a href="../languages/Menèian.html">Iron Elvish</a> language, as Cefa-këyê Bî was founded by <a href="../people/AnnúngilielZlêbmèjhrnp7zm4s4.html">Annúngiliel Zlêbmèj</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Cefa-këyê Bî has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Cefa-këyê Bî receives an average of 153 cm/y (60 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Cefa-këyê Bî covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4412 m (14475 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cefa-këyê Bî was founded durring the early 15th century in spring of the year 1408, by Annúngiliel Zlêbmèj. The establishment of Cefa-këyê Bî was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Annúngiliel Zlêbmèj electing to pay people to resettle in Cefa-këyê Bî.</p>
<p>Cefa-këyê Bî was built using the conventions of Iron Elven durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cefa-këyê Bî is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Cefa-këyê Bî is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of spacious carved bedrock streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  town posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Cefa-këyê Bî weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Cefa-këyê Bî's budget focused millitary grade defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Cefa-këyê Bî hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Cefa-këyê Bî is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Cefa-këyê Bî has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Cefa-këyê Bî. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Cefa-këyê Bî's parks.</p>

<p>Cefa-këyê Bî has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Cefa-këyê Bî's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Cefa-këyê Bî has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Cefa-këyê Bî's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used which employed abundant symbolic geometry, using pure forms such as the circle and square, and plans are based on often symmetrical layouts featuring rectangular courtyards and halls. These structures were is decorated with carved stone or stucco reliefs and made use of colorful stone mosaics..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is long in Cefa-këyê Bî.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿BlackwispEgret.html">﻿Blackwisp Egret</a> near Cefa-këyê Bî are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Cefa-këyê Bî's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves ritual combat to channel Invocation energies of tier 3 via speaking in tongues.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Badsey Castle is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.</p>
<p>Due to a magical anomaly, Badsey Castle is directly accessible from a nearby river, despite the lack of a physical connection between the town's pond and the river.</p>

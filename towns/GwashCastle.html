<p>Gwash Castle (/gwash/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/HollowbeechDutchy.html">Hollowbeech Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MaganKingdom.html">Magan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Gwash Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Gwash Castle was founded by <a href="../people/FalassielFryerclt4sigz5g.html">Falassiel Fryer</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Gwash Castle has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Gwash Castle receives an average of 206 cm/y (81 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Gwash Castle covers an area of nearly 173 km<sup>2</sup> (69 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1334 m (4376 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gwash Castle was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1394, by Falassiel Fryer. The establishment of Gwash Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Gwash Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gwash Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Gwash Castle is buildings are arranged arround a single premissive cobblestone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Gwash Castle's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Gwash Castle is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>

<p>The name Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Ghihubnoc05wl2qnrb.html">Ghihubno</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow was founded durring the early 16th century in summer of the year 1538, by Ghihubno. The establishment of Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow is buildings are arranged within a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow has a very calm atmosphere. People can be seen relaxing, scocilizing, and going about all manner of business other than the daily grind. Men, women, children, all can be seen enjoying life in a laid-back way in the many parks which line Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow’s streets. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as relaxing. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow used to be much richer, but something happened in the last 1 years to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> killed a tyrannical  who had controlled Gri̽ Sömyë Hadfow for years. The recitation of the hero's story remains a popular tavern and fair tale.</p>

<p>Mbö Zan Hadfow (/mbo˞/ /zan/ [popular] [stand]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/Nogrehie̜wMoot.html">Nogrehie̜w Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mbö Zan Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Mbö Zan Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Tsmeshêb5q1gh3h26.html">Tsmeshê</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mbö Zan Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 9°C (48°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 8°C (46°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Mbö Zan Hadfow receives an average of 199 cm/y (78 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Mbö Zan Hadfow covers an area of nearly 223 km<sup>2</sup> (89 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1550 m (5085 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mbö Zan Hadfow was founded durring the late 12th century in winter of the year 1066, by Tsmeshê. The establishment of Mbö Zan Hadfow suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Mbö Zan Hadfow which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Mbö Zan Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mbö Zan Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Mbö Zan Hadfow is buildings folow an organic layout of crampt paverstone streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Mbö Zan Hadfow's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. The city's monster and outlaw focused fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Mbö Zan Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Mbö Zan Hadfow ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Mbö Zan Hadfow is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Mbö Zan Hadfow long.</p>

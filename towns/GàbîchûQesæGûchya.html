<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya was founded durring the late 16th century in winter of the year 1473, by Bryn. The establishment of Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya's construction back out of the project. Bryn pushed on reguardles, and Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of narrow cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya's top tier civilian fortifications has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Gàbîchû Qesæ Gûchya, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

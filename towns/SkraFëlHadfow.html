<p>The name Skra Fël Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Skra Fël Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Kherzelvciurs6qt3.html">Kherzel</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Skra Fël Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Skra Fël Hadfow receives an average of 165 cm/y (64 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Skra Fël Hadfow was founded durring the early 17th century in late summer of the year 1629, by Kherzel. The establishment of Skra Fël Hadfow was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Kherzel electing to pay people to resettle in Skra Fël Hadfow.</p>
<p>Skra Fël Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Skra Fël Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Skra Fël Hadfow is buildings are located arround a single spacious cobblestone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Skra Fël Hadfow weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Skra Fël Hadfow's budget focused millitary grade defenses are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Skra Fël Hadfow hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Many of those buildings are schools, scriptoriums, and even one college. One can only wonder what knowledge the town has come into.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Skra Fël Hadfow was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Skra Fël Hadfow lost 206 people, 351 livestock, and 24 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 136, when members of Skra Fël Hadfow's militia enacted an operation to secure a particular ruin to utilize it for a specific task. The operation was complicated by aggravated civilians, who cause problems for the militia for a host of reasons. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in a stalemate for Skra Fël Hadfow's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Skra Fël Hadfow's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

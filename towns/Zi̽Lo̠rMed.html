<p>Zi̽ Lo̠r Med (/zi̽/ /lo̠r/ [clay] [disaster; catastrophe]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/NogreftöParish.html">Nogreftö Parish</a>, <a href="../provences/DrandrabetDeanery.html">Drandrabet Deanery</a>, within the <a href="../nations/CovenentofIrus.html">Covenent of Irus</a>.</p>
<p>The name Zi̽ Lo̠r Med is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Zi̽ Lo̠r Med was founded by Eler Phiegror, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zi̽ Lo̠r Med has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 8°C (46°F). Zi̽ Lo̠r Med receives an average of 149 cm/y (58 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Zi̽ Lo̠r Med covers an area of nearly 342 km<sup>2</sup> (136 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4130 m (13549 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zi̽ Lo̠r Med was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1364, by Eler Phiegror. The establishment of Zi̽ Lo̠r Med  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Zi̽ Lo̠r Med's construction back out of the project. Eler Phiegror pushed on reguardles, and Zi̽ Lo̠r Med was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Zi̽ Lo̠r Med was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zi̽ Lo̠r Med is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Zi̽ Lo̠r Med is was constructed arround several spacious cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The lakeside city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Zi̽ Lo̠r Med's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Astonishigly, the political statment focused walls are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>
<p>Zi̽ Lo̠r Med seems to be abandoned at first. There are people present, working their trades and going about their business like any community, it’s just they are absurdly quiet. Just as you start to think there might be trouble, you see most of them are reading. The entire city feels like a library, with those not reading remaining quite to not disturb those who have their nose in a book. The longer you remain in Zi̽ Lo̠r Med the more you start to wonder if you’ve entered some strange open-concept University rather than a city, but you can’t quite say such with certainty.</p>

<p>Zi̽ Lo̠r Med has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.

The style used is characterized by their massive, monolithic and 'blocky' appearance with a rigid geometric style.

Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific functional zones, grouped into a unified whole.</p>
<p>In Zi̽ Lo̠r Med every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Zi̽ Lo̠r Med is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.</p>
<p>Zi̽ Lo̠r Med is known for its unusual rock formations.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> saved most of the town when a natural disaster struck Zi̽ Lo̠r Med. One of Zi̽ Lo̠r Med's festivals remembers the hero.</p>

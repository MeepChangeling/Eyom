<p>The name Roddlesworth Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Roddlesworth Castle was founded by <a href="../people/PangwenDanecjn58cb7pl.html">Pangwen Dane</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Roddlesworth Castle was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1163, by Pangwen Dane. The establishment of Roddlesworth Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Roddlesworth Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Roddlesworth Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Roddlesworth Castle is buildings are arranged arround a network of broad carved bedrock streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The city's would-be-castle fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Roddlesworth Castle, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Roddlesworth Castle hate each other.

<p>Roddlesworth Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>

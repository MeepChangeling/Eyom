<p>Ned Wǟki Hadfow (/ned/ /ˈwaːki/ [anxious] [sewage]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/SkruvnōkMoot.html">Skruvnōk Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ned Wǟki Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Ned Wǟki Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Seletela4t04gwnb6d.html">Seletela</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ned Wǟki Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 6°C (42°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 18°C (64°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -5°C (23°F). Ned Wǟki Hadfow receives an average of 283 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ned Wǟki Hadfow covers an area of nearly 67 km<sup>2</sup> (26 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1670 m (5479 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ned Wǟki Hadfow was founded durring the late 11th century, by Seletela. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Seletela.</p>
<p>Ned Wǟki Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ned Wǟki Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Ned Wǟki Hadfow is is constructed  arround a series of broad cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Ned Wǟki Hadfow weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. The city's budget focused millitary grade defenses are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Ned Wǟki Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Ned Wǟki Hadfow ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Likely due to this, Ned Wǟki Hadfow is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to have homes. One cannot help but wonder what Ned Wǟki Hadfow was like during the glorydays.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Religious leaders are influential in almost any community, but in Ned Wǟki Hadfow they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.</p>
<p>Ned Wǟki Hadfow's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used makes use of a large oblong hall or building with double colonnades and a semicircular apse and symmetrical central-plan, resulting in buildings with a square central mass and four arms of equal length. Decorative features included domed rooves, arches, soaring spaces, and sumptuous decoration: marble columns and inlay, mosaics on the vaults, inlaid-stone pavements, and sometimes gold coffered ceilings.</p>

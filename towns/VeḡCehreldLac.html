<p>Veḡ  Cehreld Lac (/cɪ̘ˈreld/ /lac/ [exactly] [harmony]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/EwntewhänyHold.html">Ewntewhäny Hold</a>, <a href="../provences/KhizProvince.html">Khiz Province</a>, within the <a href="../nations/UnitedKingdomofUndermountain.html">United Kingdom of Undermountain</a>.</p>
<p>The name Veḡ  Cehreld Lac is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Veḡ  Cehreld Lac was founded by Khukretrude Ÿwesshod, who was culturaly Dwarvern.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Veḡ  Cehreld Lac has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Veḡ  Cehreld Lac receives an average of 281 cm/y (110 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Veḡ  Cehreld Lac covers an area of nearly 271 km<sup>2</sup> (108 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2194 m (7198 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Veḡ  Cehreld Lac was founded durring the late 11th century, by Khukretrude Ÿwesshod. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Khukretrude Ÿwesshod.</p>
<p>Veḡ  Cehreld Lac was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Veḡ  Cehreld Lac is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Veḡ  Cehreld Lac is is constructed  arround a series of restrictive canals mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The valley city posesses a mighty albit amaturly crafted stone wall. It was built using querried stone blocks and posesses all of the standard defencive features, including a few watch towers. While it would last against a siege, the wall's outdated and simplistic construction method percludes the possability of Veḡ  Cehreld Lac weathering a full scale bombardment durring a siege. Veḡ  Cehreld Lac's budget focused millitary grade defenses are in an unremarkable state. To some, this is the ideal sate for defences to be in. In need of absoutly nothing, and ready to serve the city as needed.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Veḡ  Cehreld Lac hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Veḡ  Cehreld Lac might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Veḡ  Cehreld Lac's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its buildings being predominantly formed through the combination of basic geometric shapes. However, it shown in the detailing given to the structures such as its characteristic tall columns, intricate detail, symmetry, harmony, and balance in their designs to an astonishing degree of precision. Decorative elements for the buildings tended to be built into the structure itself, making great use of fluting, frescoes, inlays, and embossing.</p>
<p>In Veḡ  Cehreld Lac snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>

<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Seni-êgê Ratê is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Seni-êgê Ratê was founded by <a href="../people/Trêgfe9agn19luu9.html">Trêgfe</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Seni-êgê Ratê has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 30°C (86°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Seni-êgê Ratê receives an average of 241 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Seni-êgê Ratê covers an area of nearly 157 km<sup>2</sup> (62 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7112 m (-19616 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Seni-êgê Ratê was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1071, by Trêgfe. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Trêgfe.</p>
<p>Seni-êgê Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Seni-êgê Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Seni-êgê Ratê is is constructed  arround a series of broad cobblestone mainstreets which form overlapping circles, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Seni-êgê Ratê's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>Looking around Seni-êgê Ratê you immediately realise that the locals are looking back at you. All of them. Everywhere you look somone is staring back at you analytically, looking over every inch of you, your gear, and your companions. As you get close to people, their hands move closer to their belt knife, or dagger. You may want to watch where you go and what you say...</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Seni-êgê Ratê is known for its odd use of round-a-bouts, small ring roads used in place of intersections.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Almost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but Seni-êgê Ratê is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century Mere Khanka began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which brought great calamity to the entire nation, killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. The disaster brought an end to  people,  livestock, and  buildings. The disaster is referred to as the Anguish Wind.</p>

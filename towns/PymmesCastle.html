<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Pymmes Castle was founded durring the late 11th century, by Gelë Tsîlë Hèshë Basford. The establishment of Pymmes Castle suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Pymmes Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Pymmes Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Pymmes Castle is buildings folow an organic layout of spacious split-log ties streets whihch gives the city a shape simmilar to a tree, if one views its streets from above. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Pymmes Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Pymmes Castle shows Pymmes Castle is little more than a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

It used columns, pediments, arches and domes are imaginatively in buildings of all types.

However, many buildings with large ceiling spaces had their ceilings decorated with elaborate paintings, simply because the large flat spaces could feel wasted.</p>

<p>Teargarth (/teargarth/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/KæshěhZone.html">Kæshěh Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/YeanCounty.html">Yean County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Teargarth is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Teargarth was founded by <a href="../people/GlkdsmëHodges854z3ij4u8.html">Glkdsmë Hodges</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Teargarth has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Teargarth receives an average of 118 cm/y (46 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Teargarth covers an area of nearly 4 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 6354 m (20846 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Teargarth was founded durring the early 11th century, by Glkdsmë Hodges. The establishment of Teargarth suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Teargarth was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Teargarth is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Teargarth is buildings are built arround a single restrictive packed earth mainstreet which forms a counterclockwise spiral to give the town a over all circular shape. The  town sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Teargarth's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the town's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Teargarth seems to be home to a quite vibrant and boisterous community. Everywhere one looks they can see people going out their daily business with a smile and a spring in their step. Children play loudly in the streets, causing untold havoc as youth are want and allowed to do. On second glance, that chaos continues into adulthood. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Teargarth has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Teargarth.</p>
<p>Teargarth has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Teargarth has a Guild of Nurses, which is tasked with caring for the elderly and infirm in accordance with local ordinances, religious values, and customs.</p>
<p>Teargarth has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Teargarth has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Teargarth's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Teargarth possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Teargarth has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands.</p>
<p>Teargarth has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Teargarth's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>In Teargarth snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\Tiger(CatGreat).html">Tiger (Cat, Great)</a> near Teargarth are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Teargarth's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves line dance to channel Abjuration energies of tier 1 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Teargarth is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Teargarth was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Teargarth lost 267 people, 219 livestock, and 93 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 106, when members of Teargarth's militia enacted an operation to scout a specific location for information about a particular ruin. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in a stalemate for Teargarth's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Teargarth's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

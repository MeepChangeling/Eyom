<p>Soilant (/sɔɪl/ /ænt/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/StotliaEarldom.html">Stotlia Earldom</a> of the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHobben.html">Kingdom of Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Soilant is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Soilant was founded by Thuri Phrubegra Byrd, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Soilant has a yearly average temperature of 26°C (78°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 22°C (71°F). Soilant receives an average of 282 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Soilant covers an area of nearly 268 km<sup>2</sup> (107 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3452 m (11325 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Soilant was founded in time immemorial, reportedly some time durring the late 7th century, by Thuri Phrubegra Byrd. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Soilant was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 7th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Soilant is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber and earth construction, with most buildigns first floors resembling mounds of earth, with subsequent floors appearing as elaborate log cabins, with each building forming a tiered pyramid of sorts fromed from the stack of rectangular, peek roofed cabins. Most wooden bracing, support, and trim is carved with decorative knotwork, and the larger structures even feature painted trim which emphasises the knotwork.</p>
<p>Soilant is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive baked earthen streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The riverside city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Soilant, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Soilant's Relic of the World That Was has sufferd soem light damage, reducing its function a little in some spots, but could almsot certainly preform as expected... Though some of the worse spots could lead to the loss of defenders lives if attackers identified the weaknesses ahead of time.</p>
<p>A look around Soilant has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine with the simple fact that it is abundantly clear Soilant suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Soilant long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Soilant's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known for its fluid and florid elaborate style, comprising ornate, asymmetric designs and pastel shades. It is often considered to be a playful, light style, which made exuberant use of curves and emphasized subtle asymmetry in the general shape of its structures. Walls, ceilings and moldings are decorated with numerous interlacing of curves and counter-curves based on the shapes of ‘C’ and ‘S’, along with shell forms and other naturalistic shapes.</p>
<p>In Soilant yeast remains dormant.</p>

<p>Soilant's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves orgies to channel Mysticism energies of tier 3 via proclamations.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

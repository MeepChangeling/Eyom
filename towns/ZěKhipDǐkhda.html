<p>Zě Khip Dǐkhda (/xip/ /ˈdɪxda/ [foreign] [nickname]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/JĭisăpZone.html">Jĭisăp Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/Ev-573pProvince.html">Ev-573p Province</a>, within the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Zě Khip Dǐkhda is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Zě Khip Dǐkhda was founded by Zlkdshe Trtêgartco, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Zě Khip Dǐkhda has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Zě Khip Dǐkhda receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Zě Khip Dǐkhda covers an area of nearly 567 km<sup>2</sup> (226 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1526 m (5006 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Zě Khip Dǐkhda was founded durring the early 11th century, by Zlkdshe Trtêgartco. The establishment of Zě Khip Dǐkhda suffered from many setbacks, delays, and obsticles, most notably a group of Zě Khip Dǐkhda which required millitary assistance exterminate before the community could finish being built.</p>
<p>Zě Khip Dǐkhda was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Zě Khip Dǐkhda is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Zě Khip Dǐkhda is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow worn bedrock streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city has a fortified albit thin brick wall. The wall has most of the feeatures of a typical castle wall, just on a much smaller scale and and budget. Notably brick isn't a particuarly soild choice for resisting siege weapons. Zě Khip Dǐkhda's wall wouldn't hinder a proper army, but it is more than sufishent for bandits and other small marauding groups. Zě Khip Dǐkhda's monster and outlaw focused fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Zě Khip Dǐkhda has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Zě Khip Dǐkhda ’s existence has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Zě Khip Dǐkhda is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the city. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Zě Khip Dǐkhda long.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Zě Khip Dǐkhda since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p>The center of Zě Khip Dǐkhda's town square was built around an ancient standing stone.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Zě Khip Dǐkhda was attacked by a renegade group of the army. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Zě Khip Dǐkhda lost 291 people, 174 livestock, and 84 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 158, when members of Zě Khip Dǐkhda's militia enacted an operation to gain control of a particular strategic location. The operation was complicated by extremely hostile wildlife which took many out of action. The conflict ended with needing to break through the enemy's lines, which ended in victory for Zě Khip Dǐkhda's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Zě Khip Dǐkhda's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

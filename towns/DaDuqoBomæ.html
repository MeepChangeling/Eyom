<p>Da Duqo Bomæ (/da/ /ˈduqo ˈbomæ/ [fat; big; obese] [pottery]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/Chyhye̜vno̠nZone.html">Chyhye̜vno̠n Zone</a>, <a href="../provences/RûlichyûÎyàEmpire.html">Rûlichyû Îyà Empire</a>, within the <a href="../nations/WarreneseShogunate.html">Warrenese Shogunate</a>.</p>
<p>The name Da Duqo Bomæ is derived from the <a href="../languages/S̺uran.html">Wareneese</a> language, as Da Duqo Bomæ was founded by <a href="../people/MicroperaRådschåDyëka4s7c7rx3g8.html">Micropera Rådschå Dyëka</a>, who was culturaly Wareneese.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Da Duqo Bomæ receives an average of 238 cm/y (93 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Da Duqo Bomæ covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4550 m (14927 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ was founded durring the early 10th century, by Micropera Rådschå Dyëka. The establishment of Da Duqo Bomæ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Da Duqo Bomæ's construction back out of the project. Micropera Rådschå Dyëka pushed on reguardles, and Da Duqo Bomæ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ was built using the conventions of Wareneese durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Da Duqo Bomæ is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of restrictive baked earthen streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  town rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Da Duqo Bomæ's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The town's political statment focused walls have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Whatever industry once fueled Da Duqo Bomæ ’s existence has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. On top of this is an unmistakable feeling that Da Duqo Bomæ is in this condition because there is something terribly wrong with the town. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Da Duqo Bomæ long.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Da Duqo Bomæ. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Da Duqo Bomæ's parks.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Da Duqo Bomæ.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Da Duqo Bomæ's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. These lights provide nighttime illumination to most city streets.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Da Duqo Bomæ's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Da Duqo Bomæ hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with. This hate may spring from recent events, or it may be an inherited spite from old wrongs.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>In Da Duqo Bomæ every night at precisely midnight every structure in town is engulfed by sailors fire until the end of the witching hour.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\MudElementalLarge.html">Mud Elemental, Large</a> near Da Duqo Bomæ are known to be a mutant strain of the creature.</p>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in autumn and involves square dance to channel Wild Magic energies of tier 1 via chanting.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Da Duqo Bomæ's roads were poorly made when first laid. Rather than repairing them correctly, a series of new roads was laid atop the old, leading to the streets of modern Da Duqo Bomæ suffering from potholes, cracking, and even sinkholes. The locals often repair the road by putting down wooden decking.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Da Duqo Bomæ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Da Duqo Bomæ lost 242 people, 174 livestock, and 25 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 104, when members of Da Duqo Bomæ's militia enacted an operation to break a siege of a particular mine. The operation was complicated by a trusted officer who turned traitor and defects. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in victory for Da Duqo Bomæ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Da Duqo Bomæ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

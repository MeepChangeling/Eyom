<p>Räz Luwt Engruz was built using the conventions of Undermountain durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Räz Luwt Engruz is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Räz Luwt Engruz is buildings are arranged arround a network of crampt paverstone streets which form a grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Räz Luwt Engruz, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Astonishigly, the Relic of the World That Was are in pristine condishion, as if they had just been finished before you laied eyes upon them.</p>

<p>Räz Luwt Engruz's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations.

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Räz Luwt Engruz was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Räz Luwt Engruz lost 245 people, 314 livestock, and 74 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 118, when members of Räz Luwt Engruz's militia enacted an operation to destroy or capture a particular enemy powerful weapon. The operation was complicated by an outbreak of plague which struck the ranks, killing many and laying low many more. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Räz Luwt Engruz's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Räz Luwt Engruz's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

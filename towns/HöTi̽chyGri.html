<p>Hö Ti̽chy Gri (/ho˞/ /ti̽c/ [great (excellent); awesome] [card; sheet]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/IastrokbrukMoot.html">Iastrokbruk Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Hö Ti̽chy Gri is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Hö Ti̽chy Gri was founded by <a href="../people/Kèshëik51b6u0965.html">Kèshëi</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Hö Ti̽chy Gri has a yearly average temperature of 18°C (64°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Hö Ti̽chy Gri receives an average of 150 cm/y (59 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Hö Ti̽chy Gri covers an area of nearly 91 km<sup>2</sup> (36 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3100 m (10170 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Hö Ti̽chy Gri was founded durring the late 10th century, by Kèshëi. The establishment of Hö Ti̽chy Gri was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Kèshëi electing to pay people to resettle in Hö Ti̽chy Gri.</p>
<p>Hö Ti̽chy Gri was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Hö Ti̽chy Gri is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Hö Ti̽chy Gri is buildings are located arround a single narrow paverstone mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Hö Ti̽chy Gri's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. Hö Ti̽chy Gri's political statment focused walls are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Hö Ti̽chy Gri gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Hö Ti̽chy Gri's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Hö Ti̽chy Gri yeast remains dormant.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿JackalSwitchback.html">﻿Jackal, Switchback</a> near Hö Ti̽chy Gri are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Hö Ti̽chy Gri's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in spring and involves creating small tokens to channel Transmutation energies of tier 2 via divine sermons.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Hö Ti̽chy Gri is centered around a major pilgrimage site. This may be a religious location of importance to a major faith, or it may be a more secular institution that draws the traffic, like a famous academy or the remains of some wondrous ancient work. Considerable local tension likely exists over controlling the access to the site and maximizing the profits from foreign visitors.</p>
<p>Hö Ti̽chy Gri's  is something of a geological and arcane anomaly, as neither physical nor magical law entirely explains its formation.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Kami blessed the town with good fortune for a year and a day. One of Hö Ti̽chy Gri's local festivals commemorates this miracle.</p>

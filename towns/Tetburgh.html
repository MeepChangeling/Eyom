<p>Tetburgh  (/tetburgh / [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Small Town located in <a href="../subprovences/BelthmageDutchy.html">Belthmage Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/ZiirneaCounty.html">Ziirnea County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/KingdomofHelsteria.html">Kingdom of Helsteria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Tetburgh  is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Tetburgh  was founded by <a href="../people/ZlênkdoJackaikqa6t82x.html">Zlênkdo Jack</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Tetburgh  has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cool 17°C (62°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 12°C (53°F). Tetburgh  receives an average of 240 cm/y (94 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Tetburgh  covers an area of nearly 3 km<sup>2</sup> (1 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2046 m (6712 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Tetburgh  was founded durring the late 16th century in spring of the year 1469, by Zlênkdo Jack. The establishment of Tetburgh  was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Zlênkdo Jack struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Tetburgh  as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Tetburgh  was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Tetburgh  is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Tetburgh  is buildings are arranged arround a network of narrow cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town emploies a series of defencive earthworks and fences to provide minimal protection against wild beasts and smaller groups of intelegent foes. Tetburgh 's somewhat suffishent are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Tetburgh  is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the town like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This town is as a necropolice.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shape shifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.</p>
<p>Tetburgh 's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is inspired by the natural world, characterized by sinuous, sculptural, organic shapes, arches, curving lines, and sensual ornamentation. Common motifs included stylized versions of leaves, flowers, vines, insects, animals, and other natural elements. Decorative elements found on the inside and outside of buildings include intricate mosaic work, curved windows, and decorative trim work. .</p>
<p>In Tetburgh  most nights are accompanied by colorful ribbons of light in the sky.</p>

<p>Tetburgh 's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves sacrificing an animal to channel Conjuration energies of tier 3 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Tetburgh  was attacked by members of a peasant revolt. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Tetburgh  lost 167 people, 321 livestock, and 50 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 148, when members of Tetburgh 's militia enacted an operation to deliver supplies to a particular special forces group. The operation was complicated by the officers in charge fight among themselves, weakening the army as a whole. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in victory for Tetburgh 's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Tetburgh 's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

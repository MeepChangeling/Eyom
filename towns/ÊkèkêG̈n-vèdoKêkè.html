<p>Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè (/ˈɘsɘ/ /ˈvèdo ˈkɘkè/ [orange] [lake]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/LêtdêsaraZone.html">Lêtdêsara Zone</a> of the <a href="../nations/Engineer'sGuild.html">Engineer's Guild</a>.</p>
<p>The name Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè was founded by <a href="../people/Tshêtco33i17ujfxu.html">Tshêtco</a>, who was culturaly Iron Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè has a yearly average temperature of 24°C (75°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a pleasant 23°C (73°F). Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè receives an average of 262 cm/y (103 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè covers an area of nearly 91 km<sup>2</sup> (36 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3524 m (11561 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè was founded durring the late 11th century, by Tshêtco. The establishment of Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Tshêtco struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the late 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè is buildings have been located at convienant points along the rivers Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè was built upon. Navigating the town is therefore a little chalanging as the distance between buildings verris greatly and the spacious baked earthen streets flow where they are able to be made rather than folowing the most convienant paths. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>A look around Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Maybe it’s all of those things together, or perhaps it's the way these elements combine which makes you worry someone might stab you in a dark ally for your boots. It’s not filthy, or dark, but the smiles seem strained, the locals seem to glare daggers in eachothers backs a little too much, and everyone is armed at all times. You may want to keep an eye on your valuables, and make sure you don’t wind up in any position of power. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Êkèkê G̈n-vèdo Kêkè long.</p>

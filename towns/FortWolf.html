<p>Fort Wolf (/wʊlf/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/DellmontDutchy.html">Dellmont Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/FusanKingdom.html">Fusan Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fort Wolf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Fort Wolf was founded by <a href="../people/ÈdshGoodwyn3nj4klkwwz.html">Èdsh Goodwyn</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fort Wolf has a yearly average temperature of 23°C (73°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 29°C (84°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 17°C (62°F). Fort Wolf receives an average of 142 cm/y (55 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Fort Wolf covers an area of nearly 59 km<sup>2</sup> (23 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2264 m (7427 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fort Wolf was founded durring the early 15th century in fall of the year 1405, by Èdsh Goodwyn. The establishment of Fort Wolf was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Èdsh Goodwyn struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Fort Wolf as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Fort Wolf was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fort Wolf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brick construction taking the shape of large simple gemometric shapes which ate then embelished with decorative features, but retain their simple shapes in spite of the added features such as pillars, faccaddes, and covered walkways. The blocky nature gives a general impression of extreem age, as if each structure has existed since time immemorial.</p>
<p>Fort Wolf is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of premissive worn bedrock streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Fort Wolf's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. Fort Wolf's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are suffering from significent damage, so much so that examples can be pointed to no matter which section one might have within their line of site, and most of which render sections inoperable at present.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Fort Wolf hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Fort Wolf is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Fort Wolf has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.</p>
<p>Fort Wolf's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is skipped in Fort Wolf.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\﻿StagEmperor.html">﻿Stag, Emperor</a> near Fort Wolf are known to be quite timid.</p>
<p>Fort Wolf's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Abjuration energies of tier 2 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow (/ˈulfaː/ /hjod/ [strong; tough; solid; robust] [clay]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/KrëchysnǟMoot.html">Krëchysnǟ Moot</a> of the <a href="../nations/Rosid.html">Rosid</a>.</p>
<p>The name Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow was founded by <a href="../people/Trëmëubjt6k2rdk.html">Trëmë</a>, who was culturaly Wood Elf.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow has a yearly average temperature of 7°C (44°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -10°C (14°F). Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow receives an average of 154 cm/y (60 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow covers an area of nearly 84 km<sup>2</sup> (33 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3912 m (12834 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow was founded durring the late 12th century in summer of the year 1083, by Trëmë. The establishment of Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow was built using the conventions of Wood Elf durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow is was constructed arround several narrow packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city rests behind a thin stone wall. The wall's design was likly directly copied from a castle's parmiter defences. It's simply that the arcatect made Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow's wall substancialy thinner than a castle's walls. While the towers and gatehouses are adiquite, the obvious cost savings measure of making the walls drasticaly thinner reduces their ability to resist siege weapons greatly. The city's impressive-looking wall could fail at a critical moment in battle, and would likely not even resist a few bandits with improvised siege equipment. The budget oriented has suffered a visible ammount of structural damage, leaving them effectivly useless. One can't help but wonder why the  has not yet effected repairs.</p>
<p>Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They've lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.</p>
<p>Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is famous for its stately symmetry, classical elements, and grand appearance. Columns and pillars, such as Corinthian columns, are often seen supporting open structures or porticos. Symmetry is an important feature of this style, with each half of a building mirroring the other. Domed ceilings and windows grace these buildings, with everything placed in a mathematical arrangement.</p>
<p>In Ulfǟ Hyod Hadfow it is impossible to directly or indirectly lie.</p>

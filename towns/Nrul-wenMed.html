<p>The name Nrul-wen Med is derived from the <a href="../languages/Zdaalish.html">Wood Elvish</a> language, as Nrul-wen Med was founded by Lobordes Zienra, who was culturaly Wood Elven.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nrul-wen Med has a yearly average temperature of 16°C (60°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 7°C (44°F).

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nrul-wen Med was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1239, by Lobordes Zienra. The establishment of Nrul-wen Med suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Nrul-wen Med was built using the conventions of Wood Elven durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nrul-wen Med is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nrul-wen Med is buildings are arranged arround a network of spacious cobblestone streets which form a diamond shaped grid, where each diamond verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller diamond has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The valley city is the proud owner of a proper castle-style stone wall complete with all of the trimmings. It has towers, a moat, gatehouses, drawbridges, and even merticulationsshortsizeleadershipname.. The city's perhapse unnessisarily well built defences have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Nrul-wen Med hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. The city is very clearly a joyfull place as well as wealthy. Music can be heard often, as well as laughter. The smell of food and drink permiates the air. You can’t help but smile.</p>

<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>Nrul-wen Med used to be more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. If the settlement is prosperous, the locals often lament how much more they could have had. If the settlement is not prosperous, the locals blame their ill fortunes on that event. Reminders of this better time can be found in many places within Nrul-wen Med.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Nrul-wen Med was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Nrul-wen Med lost 217 people, 119 livestock, and 26 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 191, when members of Nrul-wen Med's militia enacted an operation to bring aid to another fighting force. The operation was complicated by the enemy setting up an ambush. The conflict ended with a last stand against the enemy until a particular event occurred, which ended in defeat for Nrul-wen Med's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Nrul-wen Med's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

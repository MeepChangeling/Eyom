<p>Nut-sdurt Xluwuf (/nut/ /sdurt/ [pink] [cork; plug]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/MïpirudnopluPrincipality.html">Mïpirudnoplu Principality</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tano.html">Tano</a>.</p>
<p>The name Nut-sdurt Xluwuf is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Nut-sdurt Xluwuf was founded by <a href="../people/Zêlêm1ulw56qvwy.html">Zêlêm</a>, who was culturaly Gnoll.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Nut-sdurt Xluwuf has a yearly average temperature of 9°C (48°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a cold 3°C (37°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 16°C (60°F). Nut-sdurt Xluwuf receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Nut-sdurt Xluwuf covers an area of nearly 81 km<sup>2</sup> (32 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 906 m (2972 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Nut-sdurt Xluwuf was founded durring the late 15th century in summer of the year 1363, by Zêlêm. The establishment of Nut-sdurt Xluwuf was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Zêlêm electing to pay people to resettle in Nut-sdurt Xluwuf.</p>
<p>Nut-sdurt Xluwuf was built using the conventions of Gnoll durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Nut-sdurt Xluwuf is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Nut-sdurt Xluwuf is buildings are arranged arround a single broad worn bedrock mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Nut-sdurt Xluwuf's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Nut-sdurt Xluwuf has the unmistakable air of a city on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Nut-sdurt Xluwuf ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the city is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the city one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the city places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>

<p>Nut-sdurt Xluwuf's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by dynamic designs and complex architectural plan forms; intended to heighten feelings of motion and sensuality, and frequently based on the oval. It made extensive and extreme use of: Grandeur, Contrast, Curves and twists, Rich surface treatments, Gilded statuary, Bright colors, Vividly painted ceilings, Fragmented or deliberately incomplete elements, Large-scale frescoes, Dramatic central projections on an external facade, the use of plaster, stucco, or marble finishing, Illusory effects such as trompe l’oeil, and pear-shaped domes. While beloved by the nobility, the common folk tended to despise the style due to the massive consumption of resources required for even a small building constructed in this style.</p>

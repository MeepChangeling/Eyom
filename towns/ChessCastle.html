<p>Chess Castle (/ʧɛs/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/GreymageDutchy.html">Greymage Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/MidateKingdom.html">Midate Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Sylvan.html">Sylvan</a>.</p>
<p>The name Chess Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Chess Castle was founded by <a href="../people/GerselAymesj3gm5whl3n.html">Gersel Aymes</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Chess Castle has a yearly average temperature of 13°C (55°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F). Chess Castle receives an average of 176 cm/y (69 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Chess Castle covers an area of nearly 63 km<sup>2</sup> (25 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3274 m (10741 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Chess Castle was founded durring the early 15th century in summer of the year 1409, by Gersel Aymes. The establishment of Chess Castle  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Chess Castle's construction back out of the project. Gersel Aymes pushed on reguardles, and Chess Castle was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Chess Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Chess Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Chess Castle is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of spacious packed earth streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is the proud owner of a thick set of fortified walls fashioned from querried stone blocks. While not up to snuff for a fort or castle wall, the city's walls are naturaly much larger than those of forts or castles. Therefore, the construction such a wall is most expencive. Chess Castle's buget focused wall would serve its community well in battle in spite of looking unimpressive compared to castles and fortresses. The city's top tier civilian fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Chess Castle hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. This wealth has brought the city nothing but neurosis, if you can believe your eyes. Everyone acts as if you’re out to take a piece of them. Every door is locked and every window barred. Efforts are made to make you feel welcome, but only in the public areas of the city, particularly the market.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Chess Castle's bank was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is best known for the combined use of arcuated and trabeated construction, employing arches and constructed with post and lintel. The arch served as the style's chief structural element, with flanking columns serving as buttresses or decorations. While the general shape of their structures could be generously described as simplistic, the use of these arches and columns created a most distinct ascetic which is easily distinguishable on sight to armatures and experts alike.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 4 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century an unusualy harsh winter spawned a deadly blizard to Chess Castle. The ice, snow, and wind killed 185 people, 371 livestock, and destroyed 72. The event is remembered as Doom's Breath.</p>

<p>The name Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm was founded by <a href="../people/Adelenvtmnas128u.html">Adelen</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm was founded durring the early 9th century, by Adelen. The establishment of Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm was plagued by a lack of willing colonists. After attempts to pay people to resettle failed Adelen struck deals with nearby nations and communities to establish Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm as a prison colony.</p>
<p>Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 9th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of restrictive cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The Relic of the World That Was have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>Before you’ve even set foot into the heart of Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm, you can smell it. The incense. It hangs about the town like a cloud. Monks, priests, and clerics are everywhere, all dedicated to the same divine, all performing the same rituals to bless and anoint buildings, streets, people, animals, you name it they are or have blessed it. The same holy symbol is everywhere too. Its on buildings, on people, and even branded into livestock. This  certainly loves its divine. Asside form the revrent worship, you can see the citizens are preparing for something, and that something isn’t good. Weapons are worn openly. Defensive structures have been recently constructed to guard less used areas of the city. Merchants seem very eager to sell their wares at discount prices. Something is coming.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Shmiy̼wumíhg Gíhm might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>

The style used is best known for its striking sculptural forms and often dazzling ornamental detail that characterizes the buildings general shape.

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

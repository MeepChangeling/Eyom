<p>Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v (/deʃ/ /lom/ [torch; lamp] [firm; solid]) is a temperate Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/RatgùCounty.html">Ratgù County</a>, <a href="../provences/TafoginProvence.html">Tafogin Provence</a>, within the <a href="../nations/Daland.html">Daland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/FireCrabsrpy77txki3.html">Fire Crabs</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 25°C (77°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 20°C (68°F). Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 135 cm/y (53 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the spring. Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 114 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 7062 m (-19780 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1334, by Fire Crabs. The establishment of Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v's construction back out of the project. Fire Crabs pushed on reguardles, and Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive canals streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city rests behind a set of well fortified walls, with gatehouses, watch towers, and battlments. Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v's walls are, howeaver, fashioned from stone and timber. While unorthadox, the design looks to be functional to a reasonable degree. With luck, the untested design will remain untested for years to come. The city's unusual yet seemingly effective fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the citys defences.</p>
<p>A look around Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v is like looking into a university’s plaza on the day before an exam. People rush about to-and-fro. Discarded scrolls and quills are dotted around  city. In spite of many locals discussing academic topics, there’s little sign of any organized groups for any of that talk. Infact, the city seems disordered in general with everything scattered helter skelter about.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by grandeur of scale, simplicity of geometric forms, dramatic use of columns, and a preference for blank walls. This design ethos extended to re-imagining earlier styles of structure to create them anew, with a similar overall look and feel to one another..</p>
<p>In Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v there is a constant smell of overcooked presumably ethnic food.</p>

<p>Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves gestures to channel Abjuration energies of tier 1 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A vast influx of newcomers over the last 6 years has greatly spiked Deshlom Ji̊ Qi̊v's population. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century Pond Dreamstream began to boil, and released a thick toxic cloud from beneath its waters which devastated , killing every person and animal in its path which could not escape the cloud. Oddly, the plants of the region flourished in the years after the disaster. An estimated  people,  livestock, and  buildings were lost to the disaster. The disaster is referred to as the Grieving Wind.</p>

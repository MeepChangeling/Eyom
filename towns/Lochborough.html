<p>Lochborough (/lɒx/ /ˈbʌrə/ [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/Yaw̌myáwshyDutchy.html">Yaw̌myáwshy Dutchy</a>, <a href="../provences/TindenorCounty.html">Tindenor County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/SylvanianEmpire.html">Sylvanian Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Lochborough is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Lochborough was founded by Tshîj Stockton, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Lochborough has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 6°C (42°F). Lochborough receives an average of 303 cm/y (119 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Lochborough covers an area of nearly 330 km<sup>2</sup> (132 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 684 m (2244 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Lochborough was founded durring the late 15th century in winter of the year 1372, by Tshîj Stockton. The establishment of Lochborough suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Lochborough was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the late 15th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Lochborough is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Lochborough is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of broad baked earthen streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The mountain city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Lochborough's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The political statment focused walls have not been wellmaintained over the years, and while functional are in dire need of some loving care and perhapse light renovation.</p>
<p>A look around Lochborough makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had. Everyone quietly goes about their daily business not looking anyone in the eye.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>

Architectural characteristics include balustrades, balconies, columns, cornices, pilasters, and triangular pediments. Stone exteriors are massive and grandiose in their symmetry; interiors are typically polished and lavishly decorated with sculptures, swags, medallions, flowers, and shields. Interiors will often have a grand stairway and opulent ballroom..</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<p>The name Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä was founded by <a href="../people/ThugguhzShaihrMrirruipats19x0n6.html">Thugguhz Shaihr Mrirrui</a>, who was culturaly Goblin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä has a yearly average temperature of 14°C (57°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 28°C (82°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing 0°C (32°F).

Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä covers an area of nearly 108 km<sup>2</sup> (43 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2988 m (9803 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä was founded durring the early 10th century, by Thugguhz Shaihr Mrirrui. The establishment of Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä was somewhat plagued by a lack of willing colonists, leading to Thugguhz Shaihr Mrirrui electing to pay people to resettle in Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä.</p>
<p>Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä was built using the conventions of Goblin durring the early 10th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature stone brick construction with most buildings posessing towers, turrets, dormers, and wide wrap-around porches. An extreem emphasis on decorative features and emblishments can be seen even on the poorest of homes and makes even the most humble of structures seem a bit regal.</p>
<p>Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä is buildings are arranged arround a single narrow flagstone mainstreet with many smaller streets branching off of it which gives the city a over all rectangular shape, albit one warped and twisted by the nature of the curves of the main road. The  city rests behind the absurdity that is a thick, timber braced, wall made of clay bricks. While visualy impressive and certainly an astetic, Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä's wall provides no actual defence against siege equipment due to the choice of its cosntruction materials. Even nonexperts can tell the town is trying to impress rather than defend with its walls, towers, and gatehouses. Though admittedly, they do look nice... To primitive tribals who have never seen fortifications before. The city's political statment focused walls are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä is not quite well. Something happened here, perhapse recently, perhapse long ago. Whatever it was, it settled into the very soul of the city like a festering wound. The people go about their day well enough, but there’s a tention in the air you can cut with a knife. You get the terrible feeling that whatever it was, the wound it left will simply never heal. This city is as a necropolice.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>The locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some form of tribute (benign of horrific) in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.</p>
<p>Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town.

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century, Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä was attacked by a group of guerrilla fighters. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä lost 100 people, 121 livestock, and 79 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 212, when members of Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä's militia enacted an operation to delay the operations of the enemy. The operation was complicated by the army being put into a position where they could only choose between two terrible options. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in a crushing defeat for Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Ga̋nǎ Nāńshǖdzé̄˥ Ni̋ēkēä's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

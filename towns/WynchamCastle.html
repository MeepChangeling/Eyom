<p>Wyncham Castle (/wyncham/  [Translation Unavailable]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/QegianProvence.html">Qegian Provence</a> of the <a href="../nations/Hobben.html">Hobben</a>.</p>
<p>The name Wyncham Castle is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Wyncham Castle was founded by <a href="../people/TsêbmAffordsx5w8sqx6c.html">Tsêbm Afford</a>, who was culturaly Sylvin.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Wyncham Castle has a yearly average temperature of 25°C (77°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 31°C (87°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 19°C (66°F). Wyncham Castle receives an average of 284 cm/y (111 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Wyncham Castle covers an area of nearly 214 km<sup>2</sup> (85 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2018 m (6620 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Wyncham Castle was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1237, by Tsêbm Afford. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Tsêbm Afford.</p>
<p>Wyncham Castle was built using the conventions of Sylvin durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Wyncham Castle is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Wyncham Castle is is constructed arround a semi-circular crampt flagstone mainstreet, with smaller strait roads linking the circiles to eachother at varrious points. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Wyncham Castle, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. The city's Relic of the World That Was have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Wyncham Castle gives you a feeling of distrust and paranoia. Also greed. The locals seem to be very much into scholastic pursuits, based on the hushed, murmured conversations you hear at least. Everyone in Wyncham Castle acts like they have discovered something wondrous, and are worried they will endure some horrible fate so another can take what they’ve discovered for themselves.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Two or more groups of citizens within Wyncham Castle hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with. This hate may spring from recent events, or it may be an inherited spite from old wrongs.</p>
<p>Wyncham Castle's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used embraces individualism and experimentation. It emerged as a movement against traditional, classical styles and sought to make buildings dynamic and fun while breaking the rules. The style incorporated elements of previous architectural styles in exaggerated and whimsical ways. Traditional, conservative leanings were void in this era, with most scholars of architecture agreeing it was a time of “anything goes.”.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, autumn is short in Wyncham Castle.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>

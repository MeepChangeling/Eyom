<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå (/loˈhos̼/ /loˈrwɑː/ [accurate; exact; precise] [vest]) is a subtropical Town located in <a href="../subprovences/Qíhmveiē̼ùCounty.html">Qíhmveiē̼ù County</a>, <a href="../provences/QättzaKingdom.html">Qättza Kingdom</a>, within the <a href="../nations/UnitedKingdomofUndermountain.html">United Kingdom of Undermountain</a>.</p>
<p>The name Eg Lohosch Lorwå is derived from the <a href="../languages/Khegdian.html">Dwarven</a> language, as Eg Lohosch Lorwå was founded by <a href="../people/PyrodaliaHärtedraydmxgfnr0n45.html">Pyrodalia Härtedrayd</a>, who was culturaly Dwarvern.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has a yearly average temperature of 22°C (71°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cool 18°C (64°F). Eg Lohosch Lorwå receives an average of 275 cm/y (108 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Eg Lohosch Lorwå covers an area of nearly 6 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1924 m (6312 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå was founded durring the early 11th century, by Pyrodalia Härtedrayd. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Pyrodalia Härtedrayd.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå was built using the conventions of Dwarvern durring the early 11th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Eg Lohosch Lorwå is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå is was constructed arround several narrow cobblestone mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  town is protected by a renforced stone fence which sits atop earthwork defences, for some of the best inexpencive defences a town of Eg Lohosch Lorwå's size could have. The town's well-designed, yet cheep have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the town.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Eg Lohosch Lorwå hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this town has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Eg Lohosch Lorwå is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a town, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Eg Lohosch Lorwå. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Eg Lohosch Lorwå's parks.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Eg Lohosch Lorwå.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has a Gravedigger's Guild, which is responsible for collecting the dead and laying them to rest according to all applicable laws and religious customs.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has a Highwayman's Guild, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has a Hall of Slayers, which is tasked with maintaining the roads and highways leading into town as well as keeping them safe for travelers.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has a monistary of an order of Civil Monks, who provide divine-related services to the general public and maintain Eg Lohosch Lorwå's public wards, blessings, and other arcane systems.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Eg Lohosch Lorwå's grid is powered by a boiler and turbine based power plant.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå possesses an older civil lighting system consisting of street lamps. In spite of the Galvanic Grid, these lights continue to use their old fule sources to provide nighttime illumination to all city streets.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Eg Lohosch Lorwå's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå has a public septic system, which allows its citizens to have indoor bathrooms. The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>One or more crime bosses have a powerful influence within Eg Lohosch Lorwå. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere. Local law enforcement may know all about them, but lack the strength to confront them and their paid or intimidated henchmen.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is recurring in Eg Lohosch Lorwå.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\NightmareEttercap.html">Nightmare Ettercap</a> near Eg Lohosch Lorwå are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Eg Lohosch Lorwå's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves long periods of drunkenness to channel Charm energies of tier 1 via oath swearing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

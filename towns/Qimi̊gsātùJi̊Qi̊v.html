<p>The name Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded by <a href="../people/Trgfëm9thx27wrbb.html">Trgfëm</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>

Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v receives an average of 290 cm/y (114 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v covers an area of nearly 86 km<sup>2</sup> (34 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1504 m (4934 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v was founded durring the late 12th century in fall of the year 1076, by Trgfëm. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Trgfëm.</p>
<p>Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the late 12th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v is was constructed arround several premissive packed earth mainstreets which cross one another at certain axies, with smaller streets branching off of them to premit acess to the many buildings deeper into the road network. The overall fashion is remenessent of a circulatory system, or other organic construct, and is quite effishent in its design. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. The city's would-be-castle fortifications have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v is the large sign at the entrance welcoming you to their humble city. Children come up to you and say hi, some asking if you’ve fought any big monsters, and others just zipping away after their hello. The adults are much the same. By the time you’ve made it a significant way into the town you’ve been invited to a tavern for a pint to drink in exchange for news of the world. You’ve also had no less than three older women give you a sweetroll and direct your attention to their still unmarried children. It would be creepy if it wasn't so sincere.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v's chapel was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v there are unidentifiable people in the fog, but it seems to be okay.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\LeshySnapdragon.html">Leshy, Snapdragon</a> near Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in winter and involves creating small tokens to channel Necromancy energies of tier 3 via throat singing.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>A local has came up with a wonderful new idea 1 months ago; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.</p>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century a local hero by the name of <a href="..\people\'=.html"></a> saved most of the town when a natural disaster struck Qimi̊gsātù Ji̊ Qi̊v. A small order of knights was founded in 's honor, and bears his name to this day.</p>

<p>Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ (/ˈmʊjʊ/ /ˈmudɑ/ [slow; late] [city]) is a subtropical Large City located in <a href="../subprovences/GaVihæCounty.html">Ga Vihæ County</a>, <a href="../provences/WekerisCounty.html">Wekeris County</a>, within the <a href="../nations/DalandicEmpire.html">Dalandic Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The name Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wèshèti.html">Tauric</a> language, as Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ was founded by <a href="../people/SzazzoBeynonft9ir7jxfq.html">Szazzo Beynon</a>, who was culturaly Tauric.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ has a yearly average temperature of 17°C (62°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a pleasant 24°C (75°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 10°C (50°F). Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ receives an average of 246 cm/y (96 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ covers an area of nearly 267 km<sup>2</sup> (106 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 688 m (2257 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ was founded durring the late 13th century in winter of the year 1253, by Szazzo Beynon. The establishment of Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ's construction back out of the project. Szazzo Beynon pushed on reguardles, and Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ was built using the conventions of Tauric durring the late 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature delicute timber framework hidden behind layer upon layer of finly ground plaster bleached to an almost glossy white sheen, with green clay tiled roofs and decorative brass-leafed trim. Even the smallest, poorest looking structures appear to be expencive thanks to the extreem elegence of the organic shapes and paterns going into their lofty, spire-y, vagly gothic designs. The more well off folks live in identicle homes, save for even shiner trim and a more whimsical appearance to their structures flowing forms.</p>
<p>Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ is buildings are arranged arround a network of restrictive cobblestone streets which form a diagonal shaped grid, where each square verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller square has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  city sits behind an impressive looking clay brick wall. The wall is notable for querried stone blocks being used to renforce the clay bricks in the expected manner and locations. While the wall was built to the exact specifications of modern fortifications, one has to wonder why the money invested into creating such a well fortified wall wasnt spent on a less impressive looking wall crated from sturdier materials. Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ's walls would endure a brief bombardment, but only from light siege weapons. It seems more likly the city's walls were not designed with defence in mind but rather lending the town a certain air with visitors. The city's boondoggle-of-a-fortified wall have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>While Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.</p>
<p>Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ's garrison was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is characterized by vertical proportions, pointed arches, external buttressing, and asymmetry in the general shape of its buildings. The decorative features of the style were key, consisting of large arched windows, pointed arches, vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses, and sculptures integrated into the structure itself. Occasionally, for very important buildings, an array of sculptures or one colossal sculpture might replace the entirety of the entrance to said building.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, spring is short in Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ was attacked by soldiers from another nation, waging a greater campaign. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ lost 126 people, 157 livestock, and 20 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 34, when members of Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ's militia enacted an operation to defend a particular  faction leader, and ensure they remain out of enemy hands. The operation was complicated by a significant percentage of the militia choose to go abandon the operation and return home. The conflict ended with pitched battle between both forces, which ended in defeat for Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Mûyû Mudâ Mudâ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

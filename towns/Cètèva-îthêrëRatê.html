<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê was founded durring the early 14th century in winter of the year 1319, by Pyrodalia. The establishment of the new community went well, with no major obsticles durring construction.</p>
<p>Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê was built using the conventions of Iron Elf durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature plaster covered brickwork used to form structures with an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae can be found everywhere such that only size of building and yard can be used to measure the general prosparity of a given building's owners due to a general wealthy feeling the style gives off.</p>
<p>Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê is buildings are located arround a single narrow split-log ties mainstreet which forms a clockwise spiral to give the city a over all circular shape. The  city is defended by arcane means. It's hard to spot at first, but there's a tell tell shimmer in the air arround Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê, and you can spot the ocasional warding glyph carved into a rock or tree all arround town. These mystical defences are ancient, unknowable, and unassailable by current means... Assuming everything is in working order. Otherwise, the wards are little more than a deathtrap. Unfortuantly, these Relic of the World That Was are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>A look around Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. A second look around Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê makes it abundantly clear the city suffered something horrible some time ago. It's as if the town itself is depressed. Smiles are few, cheer is nowhere to be had.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê's citizens locals enjoy many vices and lustful appetites. They may have religious sanction for their deeds, or neighbors might trade with them for such things, or they could be followers of some ideology that blesses such pursuits. Their economy or their social organization is usually heavily reliant on such traffic, and to ensure its continuance they may have made bargains with various mortal and immortal powers.</p>
<p>Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê the utterance of expletives is impossible within city limits. This has changed as the limits have changed, but has not kept up with slang, or swearing in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\SpiderAssassin(Giant).html">Spider, Assassin (Giant)</a> near Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê are known to be almost tame, such that they can be put to domestic use.</p>
<p>Cètèva-îthêrë Ratê's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves ritual combat to channel Summoning energies of tier 3 via recitation of scripture.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

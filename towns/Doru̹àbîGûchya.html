<p>The name Doru̹ àbî Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Doru̹ àbî Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Gwenlliantlibt2jsbu.html">Gwenllian</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Doru̹ àbî Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 8°C (46°F), with its average temperature during the summer being an icy 26°C (78°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold -10°C (14°F). Doru̹ àbî Gûchya receives an average of 293 cm/y (115 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the long winter months. Doru̹ àbî Gûchya covers an area of nearly 215 km<sup>2</sup> (86 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 3222 m (10570 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Doru̹ àbî Gûchya was founded durring the early 13th century in spring of the year 1250, by Gwenllian. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Gwenllian.</p>
<p>Doru̹ àbî Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 13th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Doru̹ àbî Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Doru̹ àbî Gûchya is buildings are arranged arrounded a highly ordered system of premissive cobblestone streets which form triangular paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city has a defencive wall made from large clay bricks. The wall is constructed to the exact specifications of millitary fortifications, but the nature of its clay brick construction leaves it vulnerable to even outdated siege equipment. That said, the city is well defended against anything short of an army. The city's brittle defences are visibly old, but also obviously well maintained. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with routine mantance of the city's defences.</p>
<p>A look around Doru̹ àbî Gûchya gives you an uneasy feeling. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring jsut long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Doru̹ àbî Gûchya's town hall was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is admittedly strange and non-linear style rooted in defiance of symmetrical shapes. It championed the creation of buildings with a unique visual appearance. the structural norms of classic buildings and deforms or moves away from elementary architectural principles. By including non-linear designs processed into its buildings and favoring fragmentation, this style expressed a form of controlled chaos. Its buildings appear out-of-the-ordinary, draw the eye in immediately and sometimes create a feeling of strangeness. These distorted shapes and structure are not reserved to the building’s outer facade, they destabilize interior elements too, favoring minimalism and play on people’s perceptions by injecting a futuristic touch.</p>
<p>Due to the actions of local Kami, summer is long in Doru̹ àbî Gûchya.</p>

It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

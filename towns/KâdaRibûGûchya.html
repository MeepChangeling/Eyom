<p>The name Kâda Ribû Gûchya is derived from the <a href="../languages/Goblin.html">Goblin</a> language, as Kâda Ribû Gûchya was founded by <a href="../people/Shtignengvkbc8x2b0k.html">Shtigneng</a>, who was culturaly Rattu.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Kâda Ribû Gûchya has a yearly average temperature of 9°C (48°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a warm 27°C (80°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a freezing -9°C (16°F). Kâda Ribû Gûchya receives an average of 307 cm/y (120 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of snow during the pleasantly short winter months. Kâda Ribû Gûchya covers an area of nearly 113 km<sup>2</sup> (45 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 4272 m (14015 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Kâda Ribû Gûchya was founded durring the early 14th century in fall of the year 1346, by Shtigneng. The establishment of the new community went well, though many minor issues had to be solved as time went on. This was enough to delay construction and push back the formal opening ceramony, leading to some embarisment for Shtigneng.</p>
<p>Kâda Ribû Gûchya was built using the conventions of Rattu durring the early 14th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Kâda Ribû Gûchya is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature waddle and daub construction with good timber frames and a stone foundation protected by thatched or shingled rooves. Most buildings with second floors are built in such a way as to overhang into the streets on the upper floors for more space, as building size seems to be the primary indicator of wealth within the community. Most buildings are not decorated with any integral features, but instead use ivy, flowers, and other natural elements in planters of on trellices to breathe life into the structure they grow upon.</p>
<p>Kâda Ribû Gûchya is buildings are grouped arround an odd layout of crampt cobblestone streets, which seems to be based on an overlapping squair patern such that there are small squares at the cornor of every bigger square. Sometimes buildings exist in the smaller squaires, other times they are open spaces, or occupied by temporary structures. The  city is in posession of a finaly crafted dwarvern style fortified fighting wall, completer with lower, middle, and upper battlments for use in sloped-fire defence stratagies, murder holes, and statues which may or may not be constructs, and, of course, MERTICULATIONSshortsizename is one of the wealthiest and politicaly connected settlments in the world.. The city's Ragnarock-era relics have recently undergone extensive repairs and renovations, such that the repairwork is imeadiently apparent and can be spotted due to the diffring ages of materials. One can't help but wonder what brought the need for those repairs to the city.</p>
<p>A look around Kâda Ribû Gûchya has something terribly wrong with it. It’s impossible to put one’s finger on, but something is horribly wrong. Maybe it’s the way fog blankets the ground, but only in the connors of places. Maybe it’s the vermin scuttling between shadows in the corner of your eyes. Perhaps it’s the overcast sky which seemed to creep out of nowhere, or the distant howling of wolves. Everything is just a little too worn down, a little too dirty, or both. No one makes eye contact. Kids play quietly, but happily. Occasionally a passerby glances at you out of the corner of their eye, staring just long enough for it to be uncomfortable. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Regardless, you do not feel it would be wise to remain in Kâda Ribû Gûchya long.</p>

The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Kâda Ribû Gûchya lost 260 people, 398 livestock, and 64 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 156, when members of Kâda Ribû Gûchya's militia enacted an operation to extract assets from a vault under siege by the enemy. The operation was complicated by extremely hostile wildlife which took many out of action. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the vault, which ended in a crushing defeat for Kâda Ribû Gûchya's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Kâda Ribû Gûchya's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

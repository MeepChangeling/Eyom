<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ (/ˈjɪnna/ /ˈqiwlɪ/ [sad] [riot]) is a subtropical Town located in the <a href="../provences/LiwbărǐmDistrict.html">Liwbărǐm District</a> of the <a href="../nations/FederationofAlveria.html">Federation of Alveria</a>.</p>
<p>The name Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ is derived from the <a href="../languages/Wamzèian.html">Constructi</a> language, as Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ was founded by <a href="../people/Mb̪f̄yVúchīkīHexLiannaCú̄shHa̋ńnḱCābShèdsh96v81f2nzp.html">Mb̪f̄y Vúchīkī 'Hex Lianna' Cú̄sh Ha̋ńnḱ Cāb Shèdsh</a>, who was culturaly Constructi.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ has a yearly average temperature of 21°C (69°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 33°C (91°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a cold 9°C (48°F). Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ receives an average of 215 cm/y (84 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the fall. Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ covers an area of nearly 5 km<sup>2</sup> (2 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 1228 m (4028 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ was founded durring the early 17th century in early summer of the year 1631, by Mb̪f̄y Vúchīkī 'Hex Lianna' Cú̄sh Ha̋ńnḱ Cāb Shèdsh. The establishment of Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ  was only bairly constructed. The sheer number of problems with its founding were enough to make several of the backers funding Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ's construction back out of the project. Mb̪f̄y Vúchīkī 'Hex Lianna' Cú̄sh Ha̋ńnḱ Cāb Shèdsh pushed on reguardles, and Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ was finished, but starts off as a terible place to live.</p>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ was built using the conventions of Constructi durring the early 17th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ is no diffrent. The town's buildings feature masoned stone construction which prominantly features pointed arches, pointed ribbed vault cielings, flying buttress', and window tracery all of which share a simmilar gemoetetic patern halfway between organic and inorganic in design formaing a very distinct aesthetically integrated style. BUildings tend to reach for the havens, and more expencive homes are easily identified by their floor count as well as the addition of decorative features intigrated into the building's design such as statues, gargoyals, and embelished joinery.</p>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ is buildings are arranged within a network of broad cobblestone streets which form a rectangular grid, where each block verries in size given the proximity of the paralell streets forming each section. The ocasional smaller block has been used to construct a park, plaza, and other communal structures. The  town posesses a fortified albit thin wall of querried stone. This wall posesses most of the features of a castle wall, though it is constructed from cheeper inferior stone. It would pose a minor chalange for an attacking army, though it's clear the wall's true purpose is to crush the hopes of bandits and marauders. The town's failry decent fortifications are visibly old, but also obviously maintained semi-regularly. Its likly the local malishia or garrison are tasked with ocasional mantance of the towns defences.</p>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ has the unmistakable air of a town on its last legs. Everything is a bit slipshod and ramshackle. Everyone is at work, or drinking. No one has anything in their eyes other than fear and despair. Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ ’s existence was once fed by scholarly pursuits. But the income once drawn in by the works of scribes and academics has dried up and the town is drifting down the stream of history as it dries up. Everywhere about the town one can see abandoned schools, libraries, and other academic structures. Locals can be overheard having academic discussions, as well as talking about scholarly subjects in general. It’s quite clear the town places a lot of value on education and being a learned individual. Even in these times.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Civic Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ possesses a city-wide <a href="../misc/aethary.html">Aethary Link</a> which provides Aethary access anywhere within its metropolitan. This allows citizens who can afford the relevant devices access in their places of work, and rarely homes.</p>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ has an Office of Civil Groundskeeping, which works to enforce local ordinances relating to the construction and upkeep up of all plant life, water features, and other natural decorations within Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ. They are also responsible for the maintenance of these features. Notably, the OCG is not responsible for Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ's parks.</p>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ has an Office of Civil Vicary, which is responsible for providing a livelyhood for all officialy recognised religious figures within Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ.</p>

<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ possesses a Galvanic Power Grid, which brings galvanic current to most if not all buildings in town, and permits a great many consumer goods to function within the Town. Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ's grid is powered by a god's will and kindness.</p>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ has a Parks and Recreation Department, which is responsible for the construction, management, and usage rights for all of its parks and parklands. They are not to be confused with the Office of Civil Groundskeeping as they do not hold authority over nor responsibility for Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ's natural decorations nor waterways.</p>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ has a public schooling program overseen by the Hall of Sages who has the responsibility of ensuring access to affordable high-quality education in all basic classes (Reading, Writing, Mathmatics, General Sciences, General Arcana, and Social Education) is made available to all citizens.</p>

The septic system is overseen by the League of Sewerkeepers, who posses the legal authority to enforce all laws relating to the septic system, and are also tasked with its maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Cultural Notes</h4>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ's mayor's house was built using a different architectural style from the rest of the town. The style used is known primarily for its use of abstraction and simplicity. Clean lines, right angles, and primary colors characterized this aesthetic and art movement expressed via architecture and paintings. Its design ethos allows only primary colors and non-colors, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines. Vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. These seemingly impossible principals for an architectural style coalesces into structures which most experts find hard to put into words. It is not that their geometry is impossible, but rather the style's attempt at producing works only describable visually was most successful..</p>
<p>In Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ snow is warm to the touch and does not melt within city limits. Also it only happens during summer.</p>
<p>The <a class="articlelink" href="..\beastiary\StymphalianBird(BronzeBeak).html">Stymphalian Bird (Bronze Beak)</a> near Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ are known to be more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ's citizens partake in a curious ritual relating to their local kami. It takes place in summer and involves reenactments to channel Charm energies of tier 1 via recitation of poetic epics.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Economy</h4>
<p>The following information was obtained via the Imperial Census Bureau as part of the Eyom Economic Outreach Program. It differs from Standard Imperial censuses in that many of Tom's citizens, regardless of culture, work in more than one occupation or hold more than a single job. The Imperial Census Bureau has ruled that a job is a job, hence, the intigers within the data presented here can count an individual more than once.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strong points inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.</p>
<p>Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ is known for its well built pedestrian paths, which include foot bridges to cross the main street at several high-traffic areas.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the late 2nd century, Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ was attacked by a slaver gang capable of fielding large forces. The details of the conflict are hazy at best due to many conflicting accounts. What is known is Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ lost 235 people, 276 livestock, and 55 buildings. The conflict ended after roughly 30, when members of Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ's militia enacted an operation to rescue a particular solgiers group from the enemy. The operation was complicated by the enemy setting up an ambush. The conflict ended with an assault and siege on the fortification, which ended in defeat for Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ's forces. The war is remembered in legend by Fìkh Rs-83w Qiwlǐ's bards, historians, and legend keepers.</p>

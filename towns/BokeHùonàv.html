<p>Boke Hùonàv (/ˈhʊo/ /nəv/ [ledge] [smooth; sleek]) is a subtropical Large City located in the <a href="../provences/IēibonjāmRegion.html">Iēibonjām Region</a> of the <a href="../nations/Tetburland.html">Tetburland</a>.</p>
<p>The name Boke Hùonàv is derived from the <a href="../languages/Sylvin.html">Sylvin</a> language, as Boke Hùonàv was founded by <a href="../people/Trêtheshhb4lr0qug1.html">Trêthesh</a>, who was culturaly Tauran.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Climate</h4>
<p>Boke Hùonàv has a yearly average temperature of 29°C (84°F), with its average temperature during the summer being a hot 32°C (89°F) and its average temperature during the winter being a warm 26°C (78°F). Boke Hùonàv receives an average of 252 cm/y (99 in/y) of precipitation, most of which comes in the form of rain during the summer. Boke Hùonàv covers an area of nearly 158 km<sup>2</sup> (63 mi<sup>2</sup>), and an average elevation of 2460 m (8070 ft) above sea level.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Overview</h4>
<p>Boke Hùonàv was founded durring the early 16th century in fall of the year 1550, by Trêthesh. The establishment of Boke Hùonàv suffered from several major issues, resulting in the need to develop many solutions to basic problems. Problems such as a lack of fresh water, logistical support, poor quality tools, and the odd monster or two. Howeaver, these were overcome in time.</p>
<p>Boke Hùonàv was built using the conventions of Tauran durring the early 16th century. Naturaly, all settlmentss have their own look to them, and Boke Hùonàv is no diffrent. The city's buildings feature timber framed wooden shiethed or brick construction, which gives form to a very formalized, rational, expence effishent arcatectural style based on strictly symmetrical designs which universaly feature pitched roofs, shutters, and the occasional column or pilaster for a decorative touch.</p>
<p>Boke Hùonàv is buildings are arranged arrounded highly ordered system of spacious cobblestone streets which form hexical paterns, allowing the incides of the octagons to be common grounds for the buildings on the edges, be it for parkland, yardspace, plazas, or markets. The  city sits behind a stone-renforced palisade wall, with stone gatehouses and timber drawbridges for their trench. Unfortuantly, these would-be-castle fortifications are in extreem disrepair, so much so that one cannot tell if they are decaying from a lack of mantance or damage incured.</p>
<p>Right off the bat Boke Hùonàv hits you in the face with its success. Everyone, even the peasants, are dressed in well made clothing. Every tool and implement you can see is finely made, and people will boast to you as obvious strangers of the wonders which can be found in their markets. More interestingly is a total lack of beggars, and plenty of new buildings are going up even as you speak. Somehow this city has come into quite a lot of wealth, and recently from the looks of things. Precisely how it has gained its wealth is a mystery. Boke Hùonàv is, in a word, disorder. People seem to be allowed to do as they please with little harmoney to anything. It feels less like a city, and more like a spot people just happened to place their homes. Yet there are small elements here and there which show the underlying structure of the community. It’s just so complex, organic, and flowing one can only understand what is a piece of the puzzle, but not what its neighbors are.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Points of Interest</h4>
<p>A great magical Working has been a critical part of Boke Hùonàv since its creation, but now it's beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern science or sorcery.</p>
<p><p class="AutoUpdateTag">POI<p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">History</h4>
<p>In time immemorial, reportedly some time during the early 2nd century the Colima Range, an iconic vista located neare Boke Hùonàv, proved to be volcanic when the range erupted. The eruption was isolated to the area around Boke Hùonàv, which was swallowed in ash, lava flows, and pyroclastic gasses. Boke Hùonàv lost 183 people, 271 livestock, and 43 buildings in the disaster. The event is forever remembered as the Day of Loss's Wrath.</p>

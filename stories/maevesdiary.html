<p style="font-family: 'typewriter';">Maeve,</p>
<p style="font-family: 'typewriter';">I know everything you do is for this family. I appreciate your decision, but I don't agree with it. I won't try and tell a river to stand asside. We both know there's no force on Zo that can make you stay home.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'typewriter';">For the reccoed, I think you'd have been a fine gunsmith if you'd have given it a little more time. Mabey hired on somone to deal with the customers and you tinkered with the toys in the workshop.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'typewriter';">We're worried about you. Fauther exclusded. If you wernt doing this for your sisters and I, well... I couldn't even begin to forgive you for deciding to become a mercanary. You will find a notebook enclosed. It's enchanted. Anything you write or draw in it will appear in a copy I'm keeping. This way you can let us know what you're up to, how you're doing, and we'll know if you're hurt.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'typewriter';">Please, finish this job and come home soon.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'typewriter'; text-align: right;">With love,</p>

    <p>I'm bad with letters! You <i>know this</i>. You made a diary a letter. Please tell Susan to smack you with the news paper for me. Now I need to pretend this is a normal diary so I remember to write in it.</p>
    <p>And NO! making this automaticaly mail the letters wont help me remember to actualy write them. It's not puting them in the mail I forget to do, Lacey. You can ask everyone else. I think of a letter, I think I wrote the letter, I mail a blank piece of paper.</p>
    <p>But I am good at diaries, so this is totaly a diry okay? Which means you shouldn't be reading it! But you are, because you're <i>mean!</i> :C</p>
    <p>(I love you anyways though.)</p>
    <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 3em">Maeve</p>
    <p>P.S.</p>
    <p>No I'm not stupid for thinking that thinking will write a letter. That's how my aethiary slate works. It's not 1922, girls. Get. A. Aetha! We could chill in the cool girl Tavern while I'm gone and it would be like distnace didn't even exist, but noooo!</p>

<div class="journal">
  <div class="notepage">
      <h4 id="Day1"><span id="Month1">Dear</span> Diary,</h4>
      <p>It's the first of Fullharvest, 2000! Which is also technically 2000.008, and that's way easier to write and remember. Why do we write month and day? If you just put in the hours by decimal point, its way more efficient and, like, 30,000,000x more comprehensible.</p>
      <p>I spent a few nights at a Caffe-inn thingie majiggie called the Feral Maiden (Which was NOT run by a werewolf girl. <u style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: double;"><b>0</b></u> stars. Would <u style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: double;"><b>not</b></u> visit again.) to do a sleep study. Because reasons. I woke up this morning and checked all of my stuff to make sure it was all there. That way, if it gets stolen later I can use company insurance claims to replace it. It's no longer really under my care.</p>
      <p>That feels kinda wierd. I'll do a good job taking care of it anyways.</p>
      <p>Everything was perfect when I checked it, so I went to wait for the boss! Well, the smol boss. Big Boss is gonna be chilling at home, obviously. Important people don't like going places and doing things, and also don't have to, so they don't.</p>
      <p>They're lucky like that.</p>
      <p>I had to wait an hour for the smol boss to show up. Which sucked unwiped butt because the caffe had cool interactive tables, and I wanted to see if they'd run some games. But I couldn't do that, because I had to wait.</p>
      <p>I don't think smol boss knows that when someone says, "The meeting is at 8." it means the meeting is at <u style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: double;"><b>7</b></u>. I'll have to let them know. Good thing I have the manual for filing the paperworks.</p>
      <p>Once everything got started I got to meet the other mercs hired for the job. There's a tiny fairy lady named Merry. She likes eggs. There's also a cool death magic guy! He brought friends. They don't talk much. I think he said his name is Proathlete. Or mabey Promethium? Probedsheet? He's got a rumbly voice of rumbles. I think he's a demilitch because he's like a skull on a big shrine fort some probably undead Drakinia is carrying. It's okay though because he didn't eat anyone's souls so I guess he's a nice demilitch. That's makes 2 of those I've seen before!</p>
      <p>Then there's a guy who looks like he's named Bob. Which is great! Because he is. He seems very boring. Which is great! Because he's an <i>accountant</i>. There was also someone who didn't show up to the meeting on time. But I guess that's okay because smol boss knew about it.</p>
      <p>We had to take a bribe to an official too. Which is okay because that's legal in Hobben. I got promoted to Head of Security too! He said so when he gave me the money to carry. "Here, you're head of security for the operation." Yay! :D I guess filing reports correctly really is that important. I'm glad I asked the big boss about that, and also glad she checks her A-Mail.</p>
      <p>I hope she likes the cat pictures I've been sending.</p>
      <p>We picked up our missing merc on the way to give the bribe over. I waited while the others went into one of the city's dead person houses to pick them up (So the money wouldn't be in danger of being mistaken for a donation.). I thought they were a Kobold at first, but it turns out they're a box. One of those fancy ones you burry people in if they mattered.</p>
      <p>Apparently being dangerious is a good reason to be turned into a box? I've never heard that one before.</p>
      <p>We went out to the site after that. Serfscoin is really pretty this time of year. I like how nice and orange and yellow and red the trees are. They look like they'll be really nice to climb later.</p>
      <p>We got attacked by some bandits on the way. It was okay, though. They were awful at it. It must have been their first time. I mean, they were so bad that the got their rides shot up by the Bob. Bandit vs Accountant isn't a fair match on a good day, so they are the bad.</p>
      <p>Merry put one to sleep, which is great because I can ask her for help sleeping later. Not that I normaly have problems sleeping but I accidentally filled my sandwhich bag with coffee beans and didn't notice till after I ate them. So...</p>
      <p>Also the box <i>contained</i> our last member. I feel kinda dumb. She's a mongoose! I mean, well, a Tauric one. She charged one of the bandits. It seemed like overkill to me. I mean, I think we may ahve been attacked by a theater troop.</p>
      <p>Then a Boalisk showed up. It was ver snek! I like sneks.</p>
      <p>Everyone really overreacted to the lil guy. Smol boss used a Dragon gun on it. I was gonna make it a pet :c</p>
      <p>Everyone else thought the bandits sucked real bad too. Because Marry healed one of them. I guess that's fair? I mean, everyone's first day at work is terrible. I guess they should get a second chance.</p>
      <p>I asked the bandits if it was their first day and it was, so I don't feel too bad about letting them try again. Mabey they can give the next people a fun fight to break up the river traveling.</p>
      <p>There was a small argument about letting them go or not (and no one listened to me when I said that we don't have any real place to put prisoners so we should either kill them or let them go), and then the bandit's wizard teleported them away. Making it moot point! I checked my other diaries, and I've got 893,921 of them now. I wonder if dad will ever tell me where yo cash them in. I'll bet I could get a cool bike.</p>
      <p>We drove through Don't Go In the Middle Lake, and it sucked. Because I started needing to pee. And You know, the clock. The on. Not a scheduled bathroom break hour. Also, Don't Go In the Middle Lake has a Trench Mist in it. Its okay, we didn't mess with it.</p>
      <p>I wonder why it's called Don't Go In the Middle Lake?</p>
      <p>Then we got to Shaded Vale. It looks real nice! The trees are ver climb! Also there's a neat little wayshrine. It sure is existent! I have no idea who its for. Don't really care, either. I think I'll see if I can get a birb to nest on it. Thekle would like that.</p>
      <p>Merry got all twitchy suddenly and insisted we leave. She found a gateway that made things nighttime arround it. I taped it up with Ion Tape. Should be fine!</p>
      <p>Then Smol Boss decided to just use magic to fix it... SO that hurt a little bit. But I didn't complain.</p>
      <p>Anyways the gate dispinced little paper cups. A lot of them! I think its like Abing's bagle machine, but it makes placeware instead of breakfast. Mabey Merry is scared by breakfast? She liked the little tree growing on top of the gate though! I guess I'll get her a tree for her birthday. Whenever that is.</p>
      <p>You're supposed to give coworkers gifts on their birthday right? Not their Maturation Day, right? I think so.</p>
      <p>Then Merry passed out and took a bad fall. I tried to give her CPR, but I forgot to take my mask off so it didn't work. GOod thing she didn't actualy need it. Especialy because I didn't push hard because you know, fairy. I don't wanna smoosh :c</p>
      <p>I think we all accidently went through the gate? Not sure. But we wound up in the shadow plane for a bit. I don't get what creeped her out so much. It's just like being in dad's study. Including the random hurting.</p>
      <p>I heard something broken in the distance and decided to see what it was. It was a big broken city that looks really spooky, like the stuff mom would paint. Lots of greys, and tans, and broken dropping building parts that look like mouths and stuff. Unfortunately, as I don't know where a hardware store is, I had to leave. But I marked it on the map to fix later.</p>
      <p>Smol Boss thinks that the gate will pull stuff in every day at noon. I hope so. The poor gingerbread trim was drooping :c</p>
      <p>We had lunch after that, and Box Ladey, whose name I keep not catching, made everyone some little hand-food thingies. I think she called them tacos. She made them with some aberration she caught. I've never had that stuff fresh before. Apparently, it's not supposed to be sour? I don't know if I like it like that.</p>
      <p>I kinda dozed off a bit, and then woke up to Smol Bip yelling something about Pro-whatits. Not sure. Kinda tired. Remember that time I got locked in dad's study and got real sick and pooped out like half my blood? That is kinda tired. And I'm on the clock so I can't drink anything.</p>
      <p>You'd think there'd be an exception for water, but "No drinking on the clock" is a very clear rule.</p>
      <p>We decided to fix the gate. And then someone noticed I got hurt, so I got some medical care from Merry. Her magic healing doesn't feel like it burns, which is nice. Weird though.</p>
      <p>Almost as soon as I got fixed up, some little oily shadowy things with bones attacked us. Makes sense, with the gate there. I shot one and it exploded.</p>
      <p>Bob decided this was a good time to play a galvanic guitar for some reason. This made Marry also play some music. Then Smol Boss. Then Pro-man-dude-guy's undead dragonette decided to sing...</p>
      <p>I think we're doomed. That or I'm the only merc they hired. I'm pretty sure the contract wasn't to escort a band?</p>
      <p>At least Bob hit one with his guitar. I'll give him hand-to-hand lessons later. He's got guts!</p>
      <p>I decided to try and fix the gate a bit more. There were a few spots that needed tape and I want to make sure the northern siding doesn't fall off in the middle of the night. While I was doing that, Mr. Promuhguy's dragonnete (familiar?) tried to offer me gloves. But I have gloves. And they match my outfit. So I declined. Then I went and set up camp for the night and got interrupted by Merry finding a Dungeon Strata breach while digging a fire pit.</p>
      <p>So that was cool!</p>
      <p>I wanted to set up camp in the strata because there's always a nice room with a bed and some cooling and the spider-ratties are usually very nice, and I miss their bbq :c ... but eveyone wimped out because the hole is deep (??? So? Climb up?). I might have to get Sarge down here to straighten them out. Especially since while we were distracted the bandits from earlier stole the money.</p>
      <p>So... I failed at my job :/</p>
      <p>On the upside, some security charm blew them up. Bob thinks we might be able to find the coins, but, um... I don't think so.</p>
      <p>I guess I can repay it? I've still got plenty of my own money. I'll amail the Big Boss and ask what they want me to do.</p>
      <p>I set up my tree platform and put up my Expedition Pavilion on top of it. We'll be bunking around here for at least 6 months, so it was worth the effort.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'typewriter';">I know everything you do is for this family. I appreciate your decision, but I don't agree with it. I won't try and tell a river to stand asside. We both know there's no force on Zo that can make you stay home.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'typewriter';">For the reccoed, I think you'd have been a fine gunsmith if you'd have given it a little more time. Mabey hired on somone to deal with the customers and you tinkered with the toys in the workshop.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'typewriter';">We're worried about you. Fauther exclusded. If you wernt doing this for your sisters and I, well... I couldn't even begin to forgive you for deciding to become a mercanary. You will find a notebook enclosed. It's enchanted. Anything you write or draw in it will appear in a copy I'm keeping. This way you can let us know what you're up to, how you're doing, and we'll know if you're hurt.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'typewriter';">Please, finish this job and come home soon.</p>

    <p>I'm bad with letters! You <i>know this</i>. You made a diary a letter. Please tell Susan to smack you with the news paper for me. Now I need to pretend this is a normal diary so I remember to write in it.</p>
    <p>And NO! making this automaticaly mail the letters wont help me remember to actualy write them. It's not puting them in the mail I forget to do, Lacey. You can ask everyone else. I think of a letter, I think I wrote the letter, I mail a blank piece of paper.</p>
    <p>But I am good at diaries, so this is totaly a diry okay? Which means you shouldn't be reading it! But you are, because you're <i>mean!</i> :C</p>
    <p>(I love you anyways though.)</p>
    <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 3em">Maeve</p>
    <p>P.S.</p>
    <p>No I'm not stupid for thinking that thinking will write a letter. That's how my aethiary slate works. It's not 1922, girls. Get. A. Aetha! We could chill in the cool girl Tavern while I'm gone and it would be like distnace didn't even exist, but noooo!</p>

<div class="journal">
  <div class="notepage">
      <h4 id="Day1"><span id="Month1">Dear</span> Diary,</h4>
      <p>It's the first of Fullharvest, 2000! Which is also technically 2000.008, and that's way easier to write and remember. Why do we write month and day? If you just put in the hours by decimal point, its way more efficient and, like, 30,000,000x more comprehensible.</p>
      <p>I spent a few nights at a Caffe-inn thingie majiggie called the Feral Maiden (Which was NOT run by a werewolf girl. <u style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: double;"><b>0</b></u> stars. Would <u style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: double;"><b>not</b></u> visit again.) to do a sleep study. Because reasons. I woke up this morning and checked all of my stuff to make sure it was all there. That way, if it gets stolen later I can use company insurance claims to replace it. It's no longer really under my care.</p>
      <p>That feels kinda wierd. I'll do a good job taking care of it anyways.</p>
      <p>Everything was perfect when I checked it, so I went to wait for the boss! Well, the smol boss. Big Boss is gonna be chilling at home, obviously. Important people don't like going places and doing things, and also don't have to, so they don't.</p>
      <p>They're lucky like that.</p>
      <p>I had to wait an hour for the smol boss to show up. Which sucked unwiped butt because the caffe had cool interactive tables, and I wanted to see if they'd run some games. But I couldn't do that, because I had to wait.</p>
      <p>I don't think smol boss knows that when someone says, "The meeting is at 8." it means the meeting is at <u style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: double;"><b>7</b></u>. I'll have to let them know. Good thing I have the manual for filing the paperworks.</p>
      <p>Once everything got started I got to meet the other mercs hired for the job. There's a tiny fairy lady named Merry. She likes eggs. There's also a cool death magic guy! He brought friends. They don't talk much. I think he said his name is Proathlete. Or mabey Promethium? Probedsheet? He's got a rumbly voice of rumbles. I think he's a demilitch because he's like a skull on a big shrine fort some probably undead Drakinia is carrying. It's okay though because he didn't eat anyone's souls so I guess he's a nice demilitch. That's makes 2 of those I've seen before!</p>
      <p>Then there's a guy who looks like he's named Bob. Which is great! Because he is. He seems very boring. Which is great! Because he's an <i>accountant</i>. There was also someone who didn't show up to the meeting on time. But I guess that's okay because smol boss knew about it.</p>
      <p>We had to take a bribe to an official too. Which is okay because that's legal in Hobben. I got promoted to Head of Security too! He said so when he gave me the money to carry. "Here, you're head of security for the operation." Yay! :D I guess filing reports correctly really is that important. I'm glad I asked the big boss about that, and also glad she checks her A-Mail.</p>
      <p>I hope she likes the cat pictures I've been sending.</p>
      <p>We picked up our missing merc on the way to give the bribe over. I waited while the others went into one of the city's dead person houses to pick them up (So the money wouldn't be in danger of being mistaken for a donation.). I thought they were a Kobold at first, but it turns out they're a box. One of those fancy ones you burry people in if they mattered.</p>
      <p>Apparently being dangerious is a good reason to be turned into a box? I've never heard that one before.</p>
      <p>We went out to the site after that. Serfscoin is really pretty this time of year. I like how nice and orange and yellow and red the trees are. They look like they'll be really nice to climb later.</p>
      <p>We got attacked by some bandits on the way. It was okay, though. They were awful at it. It must have been their first time. I mean, they were so bad that the got their rides shot up by the Bob. Bandit vs Accountant isn't a fair match on a good day, so they are the bad.</p>
      <p>Merry put one to sleep, which is great because I can ask her for help sleeping later. Not that I normaly have problems sleeping but I accidentally filled my sandwhich bag with coffee beans and didn't notice till after I ate them. So...</p>
      <p>Also the box <i>contained</i> our last member. I feel kinda dumb. She's a mongoose! I mean, well, a Tauric one. She charged one of the bandits. It seemed like overkill to me. I mean, I think we may ahve been attacked by a theater troop.</p>
      <p>Then a Boalisk showed up. It was ver snek! I like sneks.</p>
      <p>Everyone really overreacted to the lil guy. Smol boss used a Dragon gun on it. I was gonna make it a pet :c</p>
      <p>Everyone else thought the bandits sucked real bad too. Because Marry healed one of them. I guess that's fair? I mean, everyone's first day at work is terrible. I guess they should get a second chance.</p>
      <p>I asked the bandits if it was their first day and it was, so I don't feel too bad about letting them try again. Mabey they can give the next people a fun fight to break up the river traveling.</p>
      <p>There was a small argument about letting them go or not (and no one listened to me when I said that we don't have any real place to put prisoners so we should either kill them or let them go), and then the bandit's wizard teleported them away. Making it moot point! I checked my other diaries, and I've got 893,921 of them now. I wonder if dad will ever tell me where yo cash them in. I'll bet I could get a cool bike.</p>
      <p>We drove through Don't Go In the Middle Lake, and it sucked. Because I started needing to pee. And You know, the clock. The on. Not a scheduled bathroom break hour. Also, Don't Go In the Middle Lake has a Trench Mist in it. Its okay, we didn't mess with it.</p>
      <p>I wonder why it's called Don't Go In the Middle Lake?</p>
      <p>Then we got to Shaded Vale. It looks real nice! The trees are ver climb! Also there's a neat little wayshrine. It sure is existent! I have no idea who its for. Don't really care, either. I think I'll see if I can get a birb to nest on it. Thekle would like that.</p>
      <p>Merry got all twitchy suddenly and insisted we leave. She found a gateway that made things nighttime arround it. I taped it up with Ion Tape. Should be fine!</p>
      <p>Then Smol Boss decided to just use magic to fix it... SO that hurt a little bit. But I didn't complain.</p>
      <p>Anyways the gate dispinced little paper cups. A lot of them! I think its like Abing's bagle machine, but it makes placeware instead of breakfast. Mabey Merry is scared by breakfast? She liked the little tree growing on top of the gate though! I guess I'll get her a tree for her birthday. Whenever that is.</p>
      <p>You're supposed to give coworkers gifts on their birthday right? Not their Maturation Day, right? I think so.</p>
      <p>Then Merry passed out and took a bad fall. I tried to give her CPR, but I forgot to take my mask off so it didn't work. GOod thing she didn't actualy need it. Especialy because I didn't push hard because you know, fairy. I don't wanna smoosh :c</p>
      <p>I think we all accidently went through the gate? Not sure. But we wound up in the shadow plane for a bit. I don't get what creeped her out so much. It's just like being in dad's study. Including the random hurting.</p>
      <p>I heard something broken in the distance and decided to see what it was. It was a big broken city that looks really spooky, like the stuff mom would paint. Lots of greys, and tans, and broken dropping building parts that look like mouths and stuff. Unfortunately, as I don't know where a hardware store is, I had to leave. But I marked it on the map to fix later.</p>
      <p>Smol Boss thinks that the gate will pull stuff in every day at noon. I hope so. The poor gingerbread trim was drooping :c</p>
      <p>We had lunch after that, and Box Ladey, whose name I keep not catching, made everyone some little hand-food thingies. I think she called them tacos. She made them with some aberration she caught. I've never had that stuff fresh before. Apparently, it's not supposed to be sour? I don't know if I like it like that.</p>
      <p>I kinda dozed off a bit, and then woke up to Smol Bip yelling something about Pro-whatits. Not sure. Kinda tired. Remember that time I got locked in dad's study and got real sick and pooped out like half my blood? That is kinda tired. And I'm on the clock so I can't drink anything.</p>
      <p>You'd think there'd be an exception for water, but "No drinking on the clock" is a very clear rule.</p>
      <p>We decided to fix the gate. And then someone noticed I got hurt, so I got some medical care from Merry. Her magic healing doesn't feel like it burns, which is nice. Weird though.</p>
      <p>Almost as soon as I got fixed up, some little oily shadowy things with bones attacked us. Makes sense, with the gate there. I shot one and it exploded.</p>
      <p>Bob decided this was a good time to play a galvanic guitar for some reason. This made Marry also play some music. Then Smol Boss. Then Pro-man-dude-guy's undead dragonette decided to sing...</p>
      <p>I think we're doomed. That or I'm the only merc they hired. I'm pretty sure the contract wasn't to escort a band?</p>
      <p>At least Bob hit one with his guitar. I'll give him hand-to-hand lessons later. He's got guts!</p>
      <p>I decided to try and fix the gate a bit more. There were a few spots that needed tape and I want to make sure the northern siding doesn't fall off in the middle of the night. While I was doing that, Mr. Promuhguy's dragonnete (familiar?) tried to offer me gloves. But I have gloves. And they match my outfit. So I declined. Then I went and set up camp for the night and got interrupted by Merry finding a Dungeon Strata breach while digging a fire pit.</p>
      <p>So that was cool!</p>
      <p>I wanted to set up camp in the strata because there's always a nice room with a bed and some cooling and the spider-ratties are usually very nice, and I miss their bbq :c ... but eveyone wimped out because the hole is deep (??? So? Climb up?). I might have to get Sarge down here to straighten them out. Especially since while we were distracted the bandits from earlier stole the money.</p>
      <p>So... I failed at my job :/</p>
      <p>On the upside, some security charm blew them up. Bob thinks we might be able to find the coins, but, um... I don't think so.</p>
      <p>I guess I can repay it? I've still got plenty of my own money. I'll amail the Big Boss and ask what they want me to do.</p>
      <p>I set up my tree platform and put up my Expedition Pavilion on top of it. We'll be bunking around here for at least 6 months, so it was worth the effort.</p>

    <h4 id="Day2">Dear Diary,</h4>
  	<p><b>Frostfall 1-2 2000</b>. So it's been like a <i>month</i>, sorry. There's been a lot to do. Today the team decided I would be a part of their band concert thing. I guess I owe them one for fixing my ears so I'm doing the thing even though I don't really want to leave the camp empty... Maybe I can buy some construct guards. Not like, Constructis. Just lil hekc'n gud beep boopers.</p>
  	<p>We ran into an elemental on the way over, and it seemed to have some kind of problem with beavers. I'm glad everyone stopped to talk to it instead of just shooting. 9/10 times the monster is just an animal. Unless you made it the upset.</p>
  	<p>Anyways the elemental was being possessed by a shadow or something? I'm not sure. I waited in the boat so we could keep going to the concert. I don't have ADHD. I think that might make it hard to fit in with the team. I'm hoping we can be friends and it would suck if we can't because I pay too much attention to the main goal of the day.</p>
  	<p>Maybe I could find them all some guanfacine? I could probably get Salley to tell me where she gets hers.</p>
  	<p>It felt good to help tho. Also some beavers made a shrine to Numerical String. That was kind of odd.</p>
  	<p>We got to the place for the concert a bit after that. Everyone liked it. It's this big old shrine/temple looking building. Very fancy. Super not my thing, but I guess I get why other people would like it. Personally, I'd have plated it in chrome or colored glass so it's shiny. Though that might have been expensive because the place was built for very big people.</p>
  	<p>Not fat people. Like, the tall ones.</p>
  	<p>Except the people living there were normal sized. So it felt like a doll house. Specifically like the one Sally had where she "accidently" animated her dolls. They didn't talk. The people living in the temple. Not Sally's dolls. Those did talk.</p>
  	<p>Shovel didn't like being in the temple, so I told it to not be an idiot and over think things. If bad stuff happens, we kill it. NBD.</p>
  	<p>We started playing and I think that we were hired to make some dolls dance. Weird, but rich people buy lots of weird stuff so, you know? Like I know this one rich lady who bought a special cabinet to put her clothes in. Why? Are you naked that much?</p>
  	<p>There wasn't an audience or anything, so we probably just helped some rich person with finding wank material. Kinda weird they didn't just like, ask for sex. But whatever.</p>
  	<p>Anyways, we were hired by some big monster lady I guess. She was pretty! I'll bet she's not looking for a top though. She had the top energy. So I just stayed quiet and didn't say hi.</p>
  	<p>I tried to pay attention to what she was saying... Something about hiring us for something? I don't know. I got that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/FoLI9FHmV90?t=170">dumb song</a> stuck in my head and wound up looking at the floor and trying to hide in my tail again. Pretty sure my sisters know exactly what I mean.</p>
  	<p>I caught her name was Psylergus tho. I was right. Her name is Biggest Top in gobbo. I mean... I guess I could bottom for someone that cute.</p>
  	<p>Also, Marry knows how to play Goblin Poker. Because she cheats at all games. We'll have to play some time! I hope she has enough clothes to put on for at least three hands.</p>
  	<p>She cast a lightning spell (the big lady) and it didn't hurt me, so at least she knows I'm a tough girl!</p>
  	<p>I think her spell failed a bit though because it made her summon monsters in a terrifying way. Guh. I don't wanna ever push anyone out of my girl bits... Those are for putting things into exclusively.</p>
  	<p>Bob and I helped her out with medicine and bandages while the rest of us helped her guards put down her monster kids. Boy that had to be embarrassing... I'll mail her some icecream later with a note saying its okay and I get it. She dosn't know I've never had any crotch spawn, so that should be comforting to say to her.</p>
  	<p>Anyways she really hates wood elves. Like, alot. Really a lot. More than you'd think. I mostly feel bad for them. I mean, obviously they don't have dads being elves so no one beat good manners and kindness into them. So it's not their fault they're dicks. I mean, well, not entirely.</p>
  	<p>Don't get me wrong, even if an animal is only attacking because it was mistreated, you still gotta put a bullet into it. You should smile too! Less danger is better.</p>
  	<p>Then she tried to cast remove curse on me even though I'm not cursed because you cant curse a bloodline. The spell failed so bad she lost an arm (its okay, her arms grow back). Everyone insisted that meant I'm super cursed, so like... I'm gonna have to buy some highschool text books to show them that's not true.</p>
  	<p>Anyways, looks like we're double dipping on the job front by taking some jobs from Biggest Top! I'm down for that. Maybe I can do that Knight Errant thing where you have one of those romances where you don't ever really spend time with each other and pine from afar. That seems more... doable and comfortable than talking to her out of the blue and doing a date. Besides, the team's watching and might see if I went on a date.</p>
  	<p>I shudder at the thought of being walked in on while holding hands and listening to a story.</p>
  	<p>Anyways she wants us to check out the "scarry" gate from last time. I said I'd just crowbar it open and see what's going on but everyone seemed real upset about that. It's not like I've ever upset any door by prying them open. Doors love to open! Locks, on the other hand, hate that. But fuck locks! Locks are evil. Especially chastity belt locks.</p>
  	<p>May the Hells reform so locks can be banished there. At least you can smash them open with a rock. Stupid locks. Those belts are fun when they're not stuck closed >:C</p>
  	<p>A lot of discussion and planning happened next. I think she wants us to kill a specific wood elf, and the others planned for that. I didn't help much. I'm still kind worried about getting set up in time for winter, and we have tons of time to hunt down some Wood Elf. All I need to do is get a polymorph spell so I can be a gobbo on the outside too, then I walk around naked near elves and whoever I make mad is obviously the wood elf, so we shoot them.</p>
  	<p>While they were talking I decided to gift someone we think might be Irus a 2 year subscription to Plane of Battleforge. Its the best distraction I know of! Besides, Biggest Top said Irus hates wood elves too, so maybe he's not a bad guy? Maybe they just like, think he is, and we think he is because they think he is. Stranger things have happened. Like that time I left my keys under my matress and found them in Mom's house two days later.</p>
  	<p>You know, I really should get some kind of polymorph trinket. I wish I thought of that earlier. Ugh.</p>
  	<p>Anyways, Biggest Top hinted she likes buff people, so I'm going to go work out! I'll bet I can find some things to fight in the Strata like usual. The others roped us into doing more music for her dolls though... Oh well, you loose some, you loose some.</p>
  	<p>So we went back home and went to the Strata. I was kind of distracted looking for the ratties to say hello, and I don't know how but we bumped into that bandit wizard. Everyone decided to hire him. I'm not comfortable with that, but they listened to my advice on having him watched. So there's that.</p>
  	<p>Looks like we'll be planing some proper dungeon delves over the next week or so. Hopefully not a whole month... I miss the BBQ and I still have plenty of ratty muns.</p>
	</div>

<div class="journal">
  <div class="notepage">
    <h4 id="Day3">Dear Diary,</h4>
    <p>Today is the 30th of Frostfall. I'm sorry for not making more entries, it's just real busy! There's daily patrols and I also decided to buy an old gun factory in the nearby town. It was abandoned, but had most of the tools. I dipped a little into the ranch fund for this... But I think its worth it. I have my old idea book on me and I stated making some Cropdusters. They're selling okay.</p>
  	<p>Those are those tube guns with the magazine. The automagic ones that just kinda spray bullets. I'm selling them to farmers mostly, since they're basically only good for putting a lot od bullets into one thing and every farmer knows what it's like to be fixing a fence and then get jumped by a dire boar.</p>
  	<p>Anyways today we're going down into the Dungeon Strata, via Smol Boss's elevator. He built it okay but I'm worried that it's all held together with screws and pins instead of something sensible like ion tape.</p>
  	<p>We stopped on the 8th floor, and its a nice market place! Unfortunately it was closed, so no BBQ :c. Also Numbers didn't know what pitons were. Oh by the way her name is actually the word Numbers. Which made my helmet translate it bad, because its bad and should feel bad.</p>
  	<p>Anywho Numbers decided to loot a talking painting that feels like that creepy uncle you don't want to wear short skirts around. I guess to shoot at later? That led us to a brief encounter with a HUngry Fog. Bob got spooked real good by it and pulled out his machine pistols and just grated it to oblivion. Apparently he was the 3rd place finalist in a national competition in his home country of Norwik. I guess his interesting had to concentrate somewhere after he became an accountant.</p>
  	<p>I found a nice power cell, one of the Constructi kind. It was stuck in a statue. Marry yelled at me for trying to dig it out... She promised she'd try to help me make some, and I need six of those for a special project. So I hope she can do so. APparently she found some plans, but I don't know how much time she has with gear forging for the whole party to help me with the cells. If it doesn't get done in 4 days, I'm coming back down and taking this cell myself.</p>
  	<p>I looted some other machinery when she wasn't looking. Just to assert dominance. It' snot like this same thing will just reappear down here when we leave. Oh wait, it probably will.</p>
  	<p>Next room we checked was this really cool glass ball room. I'm sad it's not on the 3rd level because it's real nice, but you can't stay down this deep safely. There was also a brain dog. Which is never a good thing. Fortunately, it was very on fire and we didn't need to do dick and or shit.</p>
  	<p>Then, because it's the 30th, and so Theckle's on her period, we found a room with THREE MOOSE. So I threw a grenade I found earlier into it. It worked, thank all that is holy, unholey, and fun. I will be buying more grenades. I did not know moose were down here...</p>
  	<p>Then behind the horrible moose room, there was a room with terrifying moose shaped mummies. Really don't like this floor at all. Of all the times to not have a few army regulars. I'ma gonna have to see about getting some demo guys to blow this room to hell. Maeve pushed one of the mummies over because <i>???</i>, and that woke the other up. I was going to shovel it good, but Bob decided to talk to it. And flirted. So i guess he likes undead? WHich is fine I guess. Just kinda dry and unchanging for my tastes.</p>
  	<p>Turns out Bob wanted to see what happens if you remove one of the Strata's monsters from it. They probably jsut leave? The Ratties can just leave, so, you know.</p>
  	<p>It fell apart though. The mummy I mean. And before Bob could take it out. So, good I guess? Nothing against mummies, but the old ones are usually jerks.</p>
  	<p>Then we ran into a mimic, but it was one of the older ones who can talk so we let him just kinda go and live somewhere nicer. I think NUmbers gave him a job? Not sure. I was still real spooped by the moose.</p>
  	<p>We ran into a Skin Sticher after that. I didn't get to do much really. Marry and Numbers are real powerful. Makes me wonder why they hired me on for this job, realy. I'm still glad to be here, but all I really do is shoot and hit things. I'm not a wizard, and those two can trivialize my whole job. I guess this is why people say mages are important. Each one is kinda like a platoon of good men on their own.</p>
  	<p>I tried learning magic once. I'm not smart enough for it. Can't grock even a cantrip. But that's okay. I have a plan. Its a good plan too!</p>
  	<p>I did get to shoot the shit out of the other thing in the Skinsticher's room tho. Which cheered me up. But shooting it made me glow... and I don't particularly like glowing I guess. I do not like it. No, ma'am. Thank goodness it stopped.</p>
  	<p>We found the thingie we went down for... I forget what it was. I... Well I didn't care that much. I just wanted to help keep my friend safe. They don't need that though. So when we found a room that was some kind of theater storage room (you know how off the strata can be) I looted a popcorn popper so I can make some snacks and feel better later. I'll probably stick to making things they need. Or just, you know, job assignment duties.</p>
  	<p>Its just not fair, you know? My whole job is scouting, fighting monsters, and keeping people safe. It's what I trained for. It's the one thing I was good at that's not farm stuff. They don't need me to help in these delves, but I don't think I need them for one of these delves either. I think I could do these on my own.</p>
  	<p>I'll probably start doing them off and on again. Everyone else is... loud about this stuff. Smashing walls and doors in, talking all the time. Stomping around. I'm quiet. I can go anywhere I want without being seen.</p>
  	<p>So I'll just slip out from time to time and see if I can do things here on my own. I'll have to subtly figure out what they want from here first though.</p>
  	<p>On the up side, I found a ratty shop and they had some nice climbing claws. So I bought them. Still no BBQ tho :c</p>
  	<p>Fortunately I found one of their "do not" runes, so I know roughly where their village is. I might stop by to say hello later. I'm pretty sure they wont mind since I can at least say "am friendo" in their language and also I can come back with snacks. They like snacks.</p>
  	<p>I got to make some mouse friends though. So there's that :D !</p>
  	<p>We had one last encounter with a thingy on the way out. I got a good shot on it and had to smack it with shovel... But that didn't kill it. I moved to the side to try and drive a spear that was stuck in it deeper into its hide. The plan worked out pretty well. Numbers and Smol Boss helped me line it up. The team work was nice.</p>
  	<p>Kinda just followed along after that. Not sure why we kept exploring and checking. We found the thing everyone wanted to have. I think Smol boss wanted the whole floor checked out but... I'm not sure why exactly? A test of skill? If so that bar was passed like, an hour ago.</p>
  	<p>I think I might make nice tavern on top of the hole so people could go take a break and have snacks while we're doing stuff here. Incase they get bored. I mean, Marry had a little nap after firballing the skinstitcher. I'll bet she'd have liked to go get a drink and come back.</p>
  	<p>The last room Smol Boss wanted to check had a fucking Bebilith in it! Fortunately everyone listened to me and didn't just charge in like they had been doing. One bite from that thing and we're just doomed to die. Everyone in ABing knows that because of... reasons. We set up an ambush for it, and it worked out shockingly well. It shouldn't have. But it did. I don't like how well everything's going.</p>
  	<p>We had to leave when a dungeon quake started. I'm glad they understand that you can't just facetank falling ceiling debris.</p>
  	<p>Yes, I'm definitely building a tavern on the top.</p>

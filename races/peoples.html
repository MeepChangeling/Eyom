<h3 class="articletitle">Peoples</h3>
<article>
<p>People and peoples is a term which is used in Imperial languages to convey a very particular concept in as fair and respectful a manner as possible. There are a great many different peoples in the world. Each one the product of their biology, culture, and environment. Often times there is great tension between desperate peoples due to fundamental differences in biological needs and social wants. The term peoples was born out of the imperial study of these groups as a tool to help unify them through common understanding.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">What are Peoples?</h4>
<p>The term race is a thorny one, rooted in ancient ideologies relating to superiority and inferiority. Even if one believes there are superior members of a race, they must acknowledge that when there is different underlying biology between one person and another that attempting to ascertain an overall superior or inferior status is foolish. Of course an amphibious person will swim better than a terrestrial one. Such is the nature of biology. Equally true is the fact that the ability to breath underwater is largely irrelevant to the life a terrestrial person. Thus, the term race is unsuited for use when comparing different species, whether or not one believes in its concepts.</p>
<p>Much like race, the term species is unsuitable for classifying groups of intelligent lifeforms. The definitive trait of intelligent life is the creation of culture. When one refers to a species, they are implying that all of that species, everywhere, is exactly the same. While there is an example of cultural homogeneity known to the Imperium, the vast majority of intelligent species posses many different cultures. Cultures change, drift, split, and merge as time passes, and each defines a group of intelligent lifeforms at a particular place and a particular time. Ignoring culture when discussing intelligent lifeforms is foolish.</p>
<p>For those reasons, Imperial languages use the term "Peoples" to refer to any discrete group of an intelligent species capable of creating art, making and using tools, and possessing verbal and/or non-verbal communication between one another. Both biology and culture must be represented when discussing any such group or one will fail to understand that group.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle">How do we Summarize Peoples?</h4>
<p>The Ordos Scholortoria recognizes the cold and clinical nature of its work when summarizing people. We also recognize that many individuals will find these summations insulting. We assure you this work is done scientifically, and intended only to be used as a general primer. We summarize peoples descriptively and as broadly as possible. There are plenty of examples of people who act nothing like what we have described. Such is the nature of a person.</p>
<p>Yet, if one is to understand a group they know little to nothing about, one must start somewhere. Better to turn to a simplistic scholarly work than for each individual to turn to whatever stereotypes and popular elements of culture they know of that group. In short, our summarizations are starting points on the journey to knowledge rather than the goalposts.</p>

<article>
<p>The Uligo (aka Gellings, Oozefolk, and Slimekin) are a minor people, to whom the thought of them as a people is most contentious to the majority of Eyom's citizens. Uligo are widly concidered monsters by the civilized world, with those who see them as people dismissing them as irrleevent neolithic tribals. These views are not entirly innaccurate, yet, the Uligo have culture, make art, produce tools, and create settlments. As they pass the Imperial Standard of Sapience, they are being documented here as best they can be given the difficulties involved with studying this rare and elusive people.</p>
<p>Gellings are not classifiable by any of the standard classifications we normaly place people into. They are not humanoid, nor monsterious humanoids. Neither are they elvenoids of any kind. They do not fit into the catagories of beastfolk, demi-mortals, true dragons, or even the new thaumoic catagory created for the <a href="../races/Quinn.html">Quinn</a>. Creating a catagory for them would prove problematic, as there is an existing catagory they fit into prefectly. It is not one which is normaly occupied by sapient lifeforms.</p>
<p>Uligo are intelegent oozes.</p>
<p>The Uligo are products of Lord Irus's of the crulty. Irus's reach extends across all of Eyom, requiring active opposision by the Kami to mitigate, contain, repair, and balance. They are not always successful. On occasion, Irus is able to accuire mortal souls, which he uses for varrious projects. Of these souls, one type in particular is used for what one might call one of Irus's hobbies. Creating Uligo.</p>
<p>When Irus is able to accuire the soul of an aborted or stillborn child, he delights in torturing it for months to a year. Once board of his play he disposes of the tattered soul in a way he finds amusing, implanting it into an ooze then relacing said ooze randomly into Eyom's wilds near where they orginated. These oozes are the Uligo.</p>
<p>Their very creation causes them to harbor an extreem resentment of and paranoia twards whatever species they were destined to be before their budding life ended, as well as a psycotic compulshion to kill their would-have-been parents should they ever encounter them. These traits have resulted in the Uligo retreating to the deeper parts of the wilds where they congrigate and do their best to survive with the lot they have been given.</p>
<p>When encountered in the wild, it is typicaly by the people they orginated from, leading to Eyomic peoples distrusting them immincly, causing a feedback loop resulting in great ammounts of conflict. Despite the struggles, clashes, and hostilities, some Uligo are able to put their instincts asside and will be then kicked out of their tribe. These individuals are often able to live on the fringes of civilization, serving a simmialr role to migrant workers.</p>
<p>Advocacy groups for Uligo exist (particularly amongst the Constructi and Quinn), but face an extreem uphill battle due to thousands of years of attacks and counter attacks.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Personality</em></strong></h4>
<p>Little is known about the Uligo as individuals in terms of behavior due to insufishent sample size. What is known quite well is how they act as a group. While this is not the information required for this form of anthropological report, it will have to do for now.</p>
<p>Uligo have a deep rooted hatred for one particular race of sentient life, to the point of the mere sight, smell, or taste of their hated species greatly ajitates them. Being threatened by this people drives them to an all consuming murderous rage that can last for several hours and will not abait even if the Uligo personally kills the target of its fury. Their racial rage is passed down to their offspring, making one family of Uligo a monster for an entire people. This has made Uligo one of Irus’s deadliest creations as they cannot help but to kill in certain cirucumstances. Yet, reguarldess of family, point of orgin, and history, Uligo share one cultural trait with universal reach. Uligo stay away from “Solids”. Full stop.</p>
<p>Uligo culture emphasizes teamwork and helping other’s of the family before one’s self. It is a simple way of life which has evolved out of necessity and leaves little room for personal expression. It seems to work wonders for the Uligo, as they appear to be happy enough when observed through clandestine means. Uligo exhibit traits associated with ancestor worship, often sculpting stone into round shapes then detailing their sculptures to replicate the unique markings found on a Uligo’s core. These statues are placed in or near the bowl shaped nests in which the Uligo sleep, and suggest they believe sleeping close to an ancestor’s image is important. In addition to this ancestor worship every Uligo family maintains a small shrine occupied by a statue of an unknown entity. The entity is possibly intended to be the same, reguarldess of tribe, as the statues are simmialr in apperance. Close examination of the shrines is required to know for certain.</p>
<p>Uligo have a social hierarchy. Oddly the top of the hierarchy is composed of hunters, followed by storytellers who keep alive oral histories, then lastly the Uligo who do domestic tasks such as making simple pots to store food in and expanding their dwellings. This system indicates the Uligo greatly prise the aquisision of resources above all else, yet they do not make use of money or barter within their families. The arangment is very much akin to those widly believed to be how our paleolithic ancestors behaved as hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>The only known exception to Uligo families being led by by their hunters are the families known to the Uligo as “Many-are-one” or “Ci’lil” in their tongue. These families are composed of Uligo who are unable to divide and form new offspring correctly and instead act as individual cells of a larger organism. These tend to be quite friendly to outsiders rather than hoostile, but still struggle with anger issues. Especialy if some of their bodies have been killed by outsiders, as they remember each death and the associated pain. These rare collectives function as Clan Chiefs with many different families answering to them due to Ci’lil’s unparalleled intelligence.</p>
<p>Uligo are often driven to war by other peoples, and often decide to enguage in war to protect their terratory from outsiders. During war Uligo only attack one particular people and have only ever raided outlying communities of no more than 800 individuals (likly due to the Uligo's small numbers rather than any sence of honor, stratagy, or tatics). Their attacks are often mistaken for plague as they choose to burn and suffocate their victims rather than fully consume them. The Uligo see this as a warning to all of their hated kind to stay away. Some choose to see this as a sign that the Uligo are merciful and fully aware of their natures and seek to prevent themselves from killing sentient creatures. This could be true, but there isn't enough evidence to support either belief at this point in time.</p>
<p>If a group of Uligo are able to interact with a people they did not orginate from, they do so with general paranoia, but do seem to be more than willing to interact peacefully. Unfortuantly, they rarly get the chance. Irus's placement of Uligo colonies are rarly imprecice.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, there are many historical accounts of individual Uligo acting in a friendly manner and attempting to become part of a community. Contemporary reporting indicates this phenominon persists, just not anywhere near urban centers.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Physical Description</em></strong></h4>
<p>Uligo are essentially a multi-purpose organ contained within a ball of air proof bio-gel referred to as a core. An Uligo's Core is approximately 2 inches in diameter and typically spherical in shape (some have been found with icosahedral cores). Their core functions as a central nervous system, vascular system for nutrients and hydrogen (which they create from nitrogen they absorb and use as a respratory medium), a crude stomach-like organ that collects nutrients and minerals broken down by the digestive enzymes within its gel. The core enveloped in a multi-sensory organ that takes in visible light, thermal radiation, sonic vibrations, and olfactory input. Their core is pyrophoric and will ignite if exposed to oxygen in its gaseous form.</p>
<p>Surrounding the core is a thick layer of organic gel composed of liquefied nitrogen, carbon, potassium and trace compounds which the Uligo has absorbed but cannot digest. This gel can come in nearly any color imaginable, though blacks, whites, and earth tones have yet to be seen. This bio-gel functions as an environment suit, keeping oxygen away from the core by trapping the gas in small bubbles at the furthest point away from the core while permitting hydrogen through to the core for digestion. This layer of gel forms the bulk of a Uligo’s body and is electrically conductive, permitting the existance of a synaptic relays matrix within the bio-gel which allows the Uligo to manipulate its gel into fucntionaly any shape. This both allows for locomotion, as well as the sence of touch, tempature, and smell. Uligo bio-gel also contains of a number of digestive enzymes which are actively toggled between active and inactive states. These ensymes exist in small pockets, allowing the Uligo to selectively eat any object it is capable of digesting, while leaving other objects untouched. It's even possible for them to eat small portions of a given object with enough detail to create fine sculpture.</p>
<p>An Uligo's outermost layer is a centimeter inch thick layer of Bio-gel is formed through oxidization. Their gel oxidizes in pockets, which floated to the surface of the Uligo’s body to form this protective layer of dead gel. This outter skin is still within the Uligo's control, though it is largly chemicaly inactive, requiring holes be opened in it inorder for the Uligo to eat (though its senses work prefectly fine though this tissue). The outter layer is not only dence but highly stable, and thus slow to lose its shape as the denser gel maintains bio-electrical charges for longer than the subdermal layers of liquified gel.</p>
<p>Uligo skin is tough enough to act as an epidermis for the Uligo, allowing them to hold their shape much like a bottle containing water. This property allows the Uligo to effishently retain a shape it has assumed while expending neglagable energy. Over time, this layer of skin thickens to the point of causing serious mobility loss and interfeers in feeding. When this occurs the Uligo sheds its skin becoming mostly liquid for a few hours until direct oxygen exposure oxidises its Bio-gel into a new layer of skin.</p>
<p>Uligo are able to control their body density by shedding and absorbing nitrogen gas, as well as liquified hydrogen gas which they store in their bio-gel as their equivilent to cellular food. The average Uligo’s body has an uncompressed volume of approximately 25 gallons of liquified hydrogen, and several dozen cubic feet of compressed nitrogen gas. This density control is sectionable, allowing them to change shape and volume at will such that they can reduce their overall volume to 12% of their normal state, or expand it to twice their usual space. As this is a change in volume ratehr than mass, their weight remains the same. This meaks their shapechanging ability primarily useful for assuming the apperance of other organisums and navigating through their environment rather than for attack or defence.</p>
<p>An Uligo is capable of adding mass by consuming edible matter, or assimilating other species of oozes until it reaches an uncompressed, deflated volume of 400 gallons. At this point, they appear to begin to feel fat and become too depressed to eat. Thus, they begin loose mass. Alternativly, they can choose to bud to shed the mass instead.</p>
<p>Uligo are born one of two ways. The first and least common way creates a new Uligo family and is the result of Lord Irus torturing an aborted or stillborn soul then placing the soul into an ooze, as previously described. The more common way is for a Uligo of sufficient age and mass who has eaten enough to have excess energy to undergo meiosis, which over the course of 3 days will result in the Uligo making a nearly-prefect copy of itself which becomes its own separate entity.</p>
<p>An Uligo can continue to exist so as long as their cores do not receive any major damage. Due to the majority of their mass being their bio-gel damage to their body is usually repaired within hours. Combined with the fact that Uligo suffer no debilitating conditions from age and the race is classifiable as biologicaly immortal.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Relations</em></strong></h4>
<p>A lifetime of persecution leaves the average Uligo wary and quick to anger, yet those who break through its savage exterior might find a well-hidden core of empathy. Fae and Sylvin tend to be the least accepting of Uligo, and other peoples aren't much more understanding. Rural Sylvin societies with few monstrous problems tend to be the most accommodating, and very rarly Uligo near their communities serve as scouts and hunters in exchange for items they cannot produce themselves (often jars, which they use as beds).</p>
<p>There are two peoples of Eyom who are entirly open to Uligo, niether of which are sources of Uligo themselves. The Constructi (Who cannot produce Uligo as they do not sexualy reproduce.) have openly welcomed the Uligo to migrate to their lands if they wish, though none know if any significent number of Uligo have taken them up on this offer. The Quinn are somehow immune to Irus's tampering in so far as the production of Uligo, and as Uligo that happen to inhabit the entrences of caves which lead to the Quinn's watter underworld on occasion, the Quinn have repeatedly and cheerfuly offered to pay for the added surcity. The Uligo have never accepted the offer, and often move. This results in the Quinn liking Uligo, but never interacting with them lest they leave and take the cave moulth filled with agressive acid-people away. This is naturaly an unacceptable secirity loss for those who benifit from it.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Settlements</em></strong></h4>
<p>Uligo live in groups of 12 to 50 called families. Each family is typically formed from a single Uligo dividing over the years. The families are reclusive, often living in caves, and surviving by hunting small wild creatures, and are generally savage in their actions. They do not seek to expand too much, build great works, or advance in technology. THis appears to be due to them not knowing how to begin to do these things. Most Uligo are content to live in caves and eat the rock to form intricate tunnel-homes. However some of the more adventurous ones form surface dwellings, which frequently come into conflict with other peoples.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Alignment</em></strong></h4>
<p>Due to orgins and the general policiy of "Kill on Sight" they are subjected to, most Uligo are bitter, violent, and reclusive. Evil comes easily to them, but their actions amongst eachother and those who gain their trust show Uligo are not evil by nature. It's simply that Uligo have been taught through long experience that there is no point doing anything but that which directly benefit themselves or their family. Anything else will almost certainly come back to haunt them.</p>
<p>In the rare cases where individual Uligo have become parts of other scocieties, they have behaved remarkably simmilar to humans. They are greedy, but with a purpose. They care for others so long as they care for them in turn. They closly adheare to the values of the culture they enguage with. The only human behavior they lack is the damndable trait of petty oneupsmanship.</p>


<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Adventurers</em></strong></h4>
<p>Many Uligo take to lives of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or just find a tasty thing to eat. Others, who are either more optimistic or desperate for acceptance, take up the mantle of crusaders in order to prove their worth to the world. That has almost never ended well.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Racial Traits</em></strong></h4>
<div id="StandardRacialTraits">
<h3>Standard Racial Traits</h3>
<p><strong>Ability Score Racial Traits:</strong> <span id="AbilityScoreRacialTraits">Uligo gain -2 Str, +2 Dex, -4 Wis, and +2 Cha.<br /></span><strong>Type:</strong> <span id="CreatureType">Uligo are oozes with the aquatic and earth subtypes.<br /></span><strong>Size:</strong> <span id="RaceSize">Uligo are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.<br /></span><strong>Speed:</strong> <span id="RaceSpeed">Uligo have a base speed of 30 feet. They also have a climb speed of 30 feet, which also grants them a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. They also have a burrow speed of 10 feet, if they cut a 2 inch wide tunnel just big enough for them to squease through. An Uligo can make a tunnel big enough for medium creatures to crawl through at a rate of 5 feet per hour.<br /></span><strong>Languages:</strong> <span id="Languages">Uligo begin play speaking Common.<br /></span><strong>Cave Goo:</strong> Uligo can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as if under the effects of the spell Spider Climb, save that she cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This trait doubles the normal +8 racial bonus on Climb checks normally granted to creatures with a climb speed (to a total +16 bonus). Uligo can move unhindered through difficult terrain while underground, or on any other rocky terrain. In addition, a Uligo with a Dexterity score of 13 or higher gains Nimble Moves as a bonus feat.<br /><span id="Languages"><strong>Amphibious:</strong> Uligo are amphibious and can breathe both air and water.<br /></span><strong>Lesser Morphball (Ex):</strong> A Uligo can assume the appearance of any Small, Medium, or large creature. This does not change any ability scores, nor is the transformation convincing enough to serve as a good disguise on its own. An Uligo gains the general capabilities of the form they take. This allows them to gain any purely form-based abilities of the creature they mimic. This ability cannot be used to replicate magical abilities, nor abilities that depend on specific biology. It can only grant the Uligo abilities based on the physical form of the creature.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Examples: A Uligo can take humanoid form to humanoid equipment (A Uligo can reshape themselves to fit any item and thus never needs to adjust armor or clothing).<br />A Uligo can take a quadrupedal form to gain a +10 bonus to their land speed.<br />A Uligo can take a winged form to glide via the fly skill.<br />A Uligo can take an aquatic creature's form for a +20 boost to their swim speed.<br />A Uligo can reshape themselves for cosmetic purposes to the extent of their imagination.</p>
<p>Changing form is a move action. A Uligo can revert to its natural shape as a free action. A Uligo's natural form can slip through any gap that is at least two square inches in size.<br />A Uligo may use this ability to unspool a number of tentacles equal to their DEX mod from their current form to use as 1d4 + 1/2 STR (acid) Slam attacks, regardless of what form it is currently in. This is a full attack action.<br /><strong>Psudopods:</strong> Uligo can create psudopods which are extremely adept limbs. They can use a single psudopods to perform any task a humanoid can perform with one hand, and two in order to perform any task a humanoid might with two hands. Many Uligo dislike being limited to two primary manipulator limbs and will make extra arms and hands as needed. When assuming a form, a Uligo can choose to either leave up to two tentacles free to use as secondary hands, or form a second pair of arms and hands. In either case, this grants the Uligo <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/multiattack-combat/">multi-attack</a> with a caveat.<br />Leaving tentacles free Grants a +2 bonus to any DEX-based skill check, but a -2 to any STR-based skill check. Creating extra arms produces the opposite effect. A Uligo can switch between arms and tentacles by changing form as per <strong>Lesser Morphball</strong>. Lastly, a Uligo with Two-Weapon fighting has no penalties to secondary attacks when using this ability in conjunction with Two Weapon Fighting.<br /><strong>Combustible Core:</strong> Uligo's vital organs are all contained within their core in a centralised. package. This makes it very hard to land a substantial blow against them. A Uligo has a 50% chance to negate the damage multiplication of any critical hit they are subjected to, in which case they take normal damage (Though the attack will still automatically hit them). However, as their vitals are all centralized, hitting one means likely hitting several at once. Consequently, when Critically Hit, a Uligo takes damage as if the weapon's critical multiplier was 1 higher. Lastly, should a Uligo's core be exposed to oxygen (other than that within water) it ignites, burning for 1d2 points of CON damage per round until extinguished (being immersed in bio-gel extinguishes the core, and can be done as a swift action on the Uligo's next turn if they are conscious and still within their gel.)<br /><strong>Acid Touch:</strong> An Uligo can deal 1d4+CHA points of acid damage per round to any object or creature they can touch. They cannot disolve glass or metals.<br /><strong>Core Vision:</strong> Uligo's visual receptors are stuck to the the outside surface of their core and use their gel as a transmitter. This allows them to see in a 360 bubble around them, granting them a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks and making them immune to flanking. Additionally, using nonvisual senses such as acute smell or hearing, uligo notice things they cannot see. Uligo usually do not need to make Perception checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within 30 feet, provided they have line of effect to that creature. A creature that the uligo cannot see still has total concealment against her, and the uligo still has the normal miss chance when attacking creatures that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of uligo. Uligo are still never their Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks from creatures they cannot see.<br /><strong>Elemental Weakness:</strong> Uligo are extremely susceptible to fire and cold, and have a vulnerability to both elements.</p>

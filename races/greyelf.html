<article>
<p>Grey Elves are a mysterious elvenoid people who hail from nowhere, yet can be found all across Eyom. In their case, found is a very apt word. Grey Elves appear out of thin air on nights with a perigean moon, at the very moment the moon has reached its zenith, Gray Elves will appear without fanfare in shallow pits within the deeper recesses of the forests. These pits may be natural caves, the burrows of larger animals, or open graves. Seemingly any crevice within the earth a Grey Elf can be made to fit into when curled knees-to-chest will do. The odds of any particular depression manifesting a Grey Elf is low, though as Eyom is quite large many appear each year.</p>
<p>There are enough Grey Elves in Eyom to form small cultures in most regions, but this has not happened. Grey Elves seem to prefer joining others rather than leading. At least in so far as creating culture and civilization. Instead, they assimilate into the places where they are found becoming productive members of the local community. In time they become entirly indistinguishable from locals in terms of behavior, modes of speech, and general culture. Once "naturalized" in this manner, Grey Elves do not change if they choose to move selswhere. It is as if they were born and raised in the locvation they were discovered, even though they manifest as adults.</p>
<p>Grey Elves are the closest known living elvenoids to the <a href="../cultures/ancient.html">Z̚omans</a>, based on scientific analysis of their natural magical abilities and comparisons to known Z̚oman capabilities. The margin is slim, however, with Iron and Wood elves being only a hairsbreadth behind. Biologically, Grey Elves are further from Z̚omans than other living elves, as they are notably mutated and seemingly universally implanted with construct components.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Personality</em></strong></h4>
<p>There are some traits common to Grey Elves which indicate they have some instinctive behaviors despite their seemingly automatic and natural assimilation. </p>
<p>When a Grey Elf first manifests, they are deep within a form of magical sleep which cannot be broken by anything save for the passage of time, or direct contact by a living organism. Once awakened, they are possess by a fit of madness and will scream, claw, strike, and bite, not in rage but in terror. This terror sate is so universally known that even young children know not to touch a sleeping Grey Elf and to find an adult who can safely subdue them.</p>
<p>This is necessary as weather they wake naturally or are touched the fit will occur, and should a Grey Elf not be naturalized, they will become a feral creature, stocking the woods and preying on anything they believe they can overcome and eat. There are many ways to calm or subdue the Elf while in this state, such that the specifics do not bear mentioning. However, once calmed, they will fall into a deep sleep which often lasts for days.</p>
<p>Upon awakening, the Grey Elf will have no memories of any kind other than the fundamental basics of operating their body. They can walk, eat, and find their own food and water, but cannot speak, will not recognize even as simple a danger as a brandished knife, and are in all ways as a child.</p>
<p>Grey Elves are conformists. They will adapt to those around them and emulate their behavior as children do. After a few months of this emulation those personality traits will become "baked" as the common folk say. Once baked, a Grey Elf's core personality traits are locked in and will not change, at least, not any faster than those of any other person. Due to this fact, most communities who are naturalizing a Grey Elf will decide what they could use an extra hand in, and ensure that the Grey Elf spends extended periods near their best people for that task.</p>
<p>The other universal behavior in Grey Elves is found in their apparent need to look at the moon. Grey Elves do not sleep, and consequently are always awake when the moon is at its Zenith. At this time, all Grey Elves will go outside (if recessionary) and spend several long moments staring at the moon. They can often be found crying during their moon gazing, but can never explain why as their emotional state does not change despite the tears.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Physical Description</em></strong></h4>
<p>Grey Elves are elvenoids. They have two arms, two legs, and a head, and are covered in smooth pale ashen grey skin (often with a bluish tinge). Their eyes are larger than that of other elves, and uniformly black in color while being quite reflective and glossy, like orbs of black jelly. Their ears are shorter than other elves, resembeling human ears with points rather than knife blades. Grey Elves have long straight white hair, a more slender and short build than the elven average, and notably more flexible.</p>
<p>Like all elvenoids Grey Elves have both male and female sexual organs, and appear outwardly to be female by humanoid standards. Unlike any other known lifeform, Grey Elves posses techno-arcane organs implanted within their bodies. Very few have the same artificial organs, and none who have the same ones have them connected in exactly the same way. Even in cases where a limb is replaced, this cannot be observed form the outside. Fortunately for the Grey Elves, their artificial hears, lungs, and even brains function exactly like that of other peoples, including requiring organic food to function and responding to disease, damage, and all other factors identically to normal tissues.</p>
<p>The amazing complexity and organic-mimicry of their artificial parts precludes them from being classified as half constructs. If you prick a Grey Elf in an artificial arm, she will bleed. And probably cry and wonder why you hurt her.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Relationships</em></strong></h4>
<p>Grey Elves are generally liked more than other elves. Their "common rarity" means everyone has heard of them and how they work. Eyom's universal belief that culture matters more than race ensures Grey Elves are treated like any member of their parent cultures. Yet they are shown a bit more favor and posativity than other people of that culture would be.</p>
<p>Of course, many people fear Grey Elves due to their origins. These fears usually manifest in avoidance, but occasionally escalate into violence.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Settlements</em></strong></h4>
<p>There are no known Grey Elf exclusive settlements. All majority Grey Elf settlements are built to the preferences of a nearby other people.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Alignment</em></strong></h4>
<p>Grey Elves do not appear to posess any particular moral or ethical inclinations. This  is not to say they are immoral and care nothing for ethics. Rather there doesn't seem to be any general trend within their people as to what a Grey Elf prefers. They appear to take in values during their naturalization, and subconsciously meditate on them until each arrives at her own idea of how a person should be. From that point, that is how they will seek to behave unless persuaded otherwise.</p>
<p>Whatever belief system a Grey Elf adopts, it will defend fiercly and with astonishing level of logic, often getting down to the axiom level to defend or attack an idea. Interestingly, their minds and behavior change the moment any true dethronement of their philosophy occurs.</p>
<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Adventurers</em></strong></h4>
<p>Grey Elves are common adventurers. They seem to enjoy travel, as well as physical danger. Most Grey Elves respond to being attacked by monsters with a smile and will talk of it later as an enjoyable struggle. To date, none have been able to explain this seemingly universal trait of Grey Elves.</p>
<p>What is known is they will spend their lives in periods of adventuring, and settled down life, simply for the love of it.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that one thing Grey Elves feel passionately about is the elimination of their feral kin. Reports of Feral Grey elves reaching civilized Grey Elves will usually result in all Grey Elves who have the time to assist assisting with the capture and extermination of the feral.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Racial Traits</em></strong></h4>
<div style="margin-left: 3%;"id="StandardRacialTraits">
<h3>Standard Racial Traits</h3>
<p class="traitTypeHeader"><strong>Ability Score Racial Traits:</strong> <span id="AbilityScoreRacialTraits">Grey elves gain -2 Str, +2 Dex, and +2 Cha.<br /></span><strong>Type:</strong> <span id="CreatureType">Grey elves are fey.<br /></span><strong>Size:</strong> <span id="RaceSize">Grey elves are Medium creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.<br /></span><strong>Speed:</strong> <span id="RaceSpeed">Grey elves have a base speed of 30 feet.<br /></span><strong>Languages:</strong> <span id="Languages">Grey elves begin play speaking Common.<br /></span><strong>Energy Resistance:</strong> Grey elves have cold resistance 5 and fire resistance 5.<br /><strong>Deathless Spirit:</strong> Grey elves have resistance 5 against negative energy damage. They do not lose hit points when they gain a negative level, and they gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, negative energy, and spells or spell-like abilities of the necromancy school.<br /><strong>Camelion Skin:</strong> Grey elves can alter the color of their skin to work as optical camouflage. The effect isn't perfect, as it cannot conceal clothing or equipment, just the Elf herself. As the elf must thus be naked for this ability to work effectively, only small objects, weapons, and tools can be concealed using slight of hand while camouflaged. The camouflage isn't flawless and causes a slight distortion of the "background" which gets worse if the elf moves. For this purpose, a Grey Elf's optical camouflage grants a +10 bonus to stealth when stationary, and a +5 when moving.<br /><strong>Teleknesis:</strong> Grey Elves are telekinetic, and can manipulate a single object or creature weighing no more than 10 pounds per caracter level at a range of up to 10+CHA feet. A Grey Elf's telekinesis effectively functions as an additional limb, but grants no additional actions. A Grey Elf can thus use this ability to perform any action they would with their own hands. There is no bonus when using this ability to perform a skill check. However, any penalty which applies to the Grey Elf will not transfer to her telekinesis, allowing her to act as if she were not affected by any negative modifiers provided she can pass a DC 15 concentration check. <br /><strong>Magehunter:</strong> Grey elves have a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify a spell being cast and a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against arcane spellcasters. Grey elves only gain this bonus against creatures that use spells, not against those that only use spell-like abilities.<br /><strong>Elemental Assault (Su):</strong> Once per day as a swift action, a grey elf can call on the elemental power lurking in her veins to shroud her arms in acid. Unarmed strikes with her elbows or hands (or attacks with weapons held in those hands) deal +1d6 points of acid damage. This lasts for 1 round per character level. The grey elf may end the effects of her elemental assault early as a free action.<br /><strong>Low-Light Vision:</strong> Grey elves can see twice as far as a race with normal vision in conditions of dim light.<br /><strong>Resurrection Vulnerability:</strong> A raise dead spell cast on a grey elf can destroy her (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.</p>

<p>Grey Elves are a class 3 Aberration which possess a static and consistent elvenoid form. Grey Elves are known to arrive on Eyom via Aetheric Transport when the moon is either new or full and closest to Zo (Typicaly once during spring, with 6-8 other suitable points occuring through the year). The start point of their transmission is extraterrestrial in orgin.</p>
<p>Triangulation of aether streams over six hundred Grey Elf manifestations revealed their point of origin as the lunar sea, Fletus Animae (colloquially known as the Weeping Soul). Attempts to observe the Fletus Animae in search of any structures or other probable origin points for the transport have failed due to insufficient optical technology and arcane interference both local (from the God Wall) and a general arcane haze covering the Fletus Animae. Attempts are ongoing pending techno/arcana breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Grey Elves Aberration classification of 3 indicates they are generally harmless. Casual observation and even dissection will not reveal their true natures. Uninitiated scientists and mages will discover their technological implants, which has historically provided sufficient distraction from their organic tissues. Close observation of their tissues combined with knowledge of Z̚oman anatomy reveals their tissue to be entirely Z̚oman in origin.</p>
<p>Plainly speaking, each Grey Elf is a Z̚oman corpse. Their flesh shows clear signs of arcane repair of dead tissues, signs one can find on many raised undead. These signs are universal and direct responsible for the Grey Elves appearance. A brief list of these wounds follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A boiling of sub-dermal liquids which destroyed melanin and scarred deep tissues, creating a uniform coat of scar tissue which appears grey when observed through the outer layers of dermis.</li>
<li>Extreem radiant damage to the outer surface of the eye, resulting in the removal of certain membranes, causing oxidation of the sclera and cornea which when healed, causes a permanent black pigmentation to develop.</li>
<li>Uniform and total scarring of internal lung tissues, implying a critical rupture.</li>
<li>Cellular damage traces can be found in most tissues, but particular in bone marrow. The damage is sever enough to prevent original genetic function, and is responsible for altering the natural magical capabilities of the Grey Elves to their current form.</li>
<li>Extreme scaring of the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as evidence of lesions on the frontal cortex may explain the Grey Elves total lack of memory, identity, and self upon arrival in Eyom.</li>
</ol>
<p>These and other micro-healed wounds exist in sufficient sate that a Grey Elf should not be capable of life. Indeed, many metabolic processes simply do not occur within their bodies. These functions are bypassed by means unknown, permitting other adjacent processes to function despite the lack of key processes. Grey Elves lack a soul on top of this, yet they are not undead. Their intimate forces are identical to living beings, and Grey Elves do not suffer from any form of Litch Lock, nor do they require arcane energies to sustain themselves.</p>
<p>Neither are they constructs (nor even half-constructs), despite the machinery which exists within their flesh (We believe the implants exist to replace missing or irreparably damaged tissues). This can be confirmed by analysis of their forms which have a notable lack of construct magical signatures, energy flows, and compositions. Indeed, their implanted organs appear to be purely technological in nature, albeit, with some arcane principles used in their construction.</p>
<p>Constructi agents have examined several of the devices found within Grey Elf brain tissue and have confirmed the presence of Z̚oman Machine Programs within them. However the Programms are either incomplete, corrupt, or missing sister-programs which would be required for the programming to function. Additionaly, the chips have never been discovered alongside any power source and thus are never in an active state.</p>
<p>In accordance with the ancient wisdom "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth", we can only conclude that Grey Elves are technologically reanimated Z̚oman. In other words, they are Z̚oman who died, were physically and mechanically repaired by entities unknown, reanimated in a means which does not require a soul, construct formation, nor necromancy, and sent to Eyom.</p>
<p>The only remaining classification for Grey Elves is Abberation. They do not operate on the natural laws of the world, nor on the arcane principals of any known plane. In this respect, they join the vast majority of extant Z̚oman. Current theories propose that Z̚oman cannot become undead, but their equivalent state is Abberation.</p>
<p>Grey Elves class 3 rating indicates them as harmless to mortal life. Indeed, many are beneficial. There is no reason to continue hunting Grey Elves which have been adopted into communities. However, due to their ability to Awaken, feral Grey Elves will require continued culling.</p>
<p>This is a living document and will be updated as information is uncovered.</p>

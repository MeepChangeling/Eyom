    <p>Fairies are a demi-mortal species of fay creatures which come about in one of two ways. They are either created by a divinity to serve a specific role within one of their plans, or simply manifest from the either for reasons known to none. Fairies are unique in that not all of them are people. Most exist for a specific purpose given to them by their creator, and after this purpose has been fulfilled, the fairy returns to the nothing from whence it came. This is also true of those which spontaneously manifest, except unlike those created by a divine these Fairies do not know what their purpose is.</p>
    <p>Fairies who do not know their purpose will inevitably do far more than their counterparts as they subconsciously search for their purpose. In this quest the Fairie will begin to develop thoughts, feelings, and opinions unrelated to that which they were created for. Should the Fairie feel as strongly about one of these things as she does her intended purpose, she will suddenly gain two purposes. This process occurs many times, adding more and more to an individual Fairie until a threshold is reached and she is no longer a tool being wielded by a god, or a part of the universe intended to write a wrong, but a true individual.</p>
    <p>These Fairies are quite rare, so much so that most people have never seen or heard of a Fairie like them. Yet they do exist, and due to their existence being entirely based on having strong opinions about many things, Fairies tend to be parts of some of the largest events in history. They are often the instigators of large scale movements, but their size is no detriment to those who are particularly determined to take a matter head on.</p>
    <p>While it is said that Fairies appear out of nowhere, this is not strictly true. Each Fairie is made from physical matter, located around where its consciousness emerged. The first action of any Fairie is to pry itself out of the medium from which it came. The cavities left behind by a Fairie (should it have come from a solid medium) are often used by locals as offering sites for nature spirits, Kami, and gods related to nature such as Tol.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Personality</em></strong></h4>
<p>Fairies are universally hotheaded and passionate people. This persists across all varieties and subspecies. A Fairie on a mission has but a singular goal and cares for little else other than that which will accomplish this goal. Every Fairie starts as that kind of being, and becomes their own person by acquiring more passions of equal or greater intensity. Thus, all Fairies whether they are generally relaxed or note will have a multitude of subjects they can become "fired up" about at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>This trait is core to the personalities of all Fairies. One moment they can be happily playing with a kitten, the next they can be delivering a venomous critique of a painting which they observed to be created with a medium they disapprove of. Many Fairies hate this part of themselves and seek a more zen existence. Few succede. It is simply their nature.</p>
<p>For Fairies who do not reach personhood, this is all there is to their existence. Those who do attain enough independent thoughts, dreams, wishes, and needs to become fully realized verry as much as the members of any other species. Their shared trait of explosive passions often put them off one another, however. They dislike being told what to do as a rule, and consequently dislike one another's company as at any minute the other Fairie may begin to insist the others all burn that man's house down for providing his dog with insufficient walks due to seeing that as a form of animal abuse. Meanwhile, the others all see this for the passion fueled insanity that it is. Fairies rarely form groups with one another for this reason.</p>
<p>There are several types of Fairies, each of which has its own common behavioral quirks:</p>
<ol style="list-style: none;">
    <li>Forest Fairies</li>
		<ol style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>Easily irritated by people who don't pay attention to them when they speak. Often yell for their attention.</li>
			<li>Oddly pyromanic and love to start, tend, and extinguish fires. They especially enjoy discovering different substances which burn in different colors.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Water Fairies</li>
		<ol style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>Can't help but prank people from time to time.</li>
			<li>Water Fairies delight in lounging in water, and will often fight song birds for bird baths. They let raptors have the bath if they wish, for obvious reasons.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Stone Fairies</li>
    <ol style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>Greatly enjoy physical activity.</li>
    	<li>Stone Fairies often subconsciously strike poses which are in vogue with the dynamically posed statues of classical Yastan art.</li>
    </ol>
		<li>Sky Fairies</li>
    <ol style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>Delight in racing larger creatures than themselves.</li>
			<li>Sky Fairies often feel the need to fly in a small circle around an object as fast as possible for several moments before resuming whatever they were doing.</li>
    </ol>
		<li>Moon Fairies</li>
    <ol style="list-style: disc;">
    	<li>Moon Fairies appear to need to make laser noises whenever they use ranged weapons.</li>
			<li>Hate encountering each other, so much so that a dule is inevetable for the terratory. Such dules can cataostrphicaly devistate... small swiming pool sized areas.</li>
    </ol>

</ol>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Physical Description</em></strong></h4>
<p>Fairies are polymorphic, with their appearances based on where they manifested and to a lesser extent what created them (Only Tol's Fairies have a unique appearance due to their originator). The most common Fairie forms are Forest and Water, though there are also Stone, Sky, and Moon Fairies. All fairies appear to be tiny elves at a glance. They do possess unique features which are distinctly Fairie, but most will never notice these features due to the size differences. A magnifying glass is required to take in the differences in eye shape, the angles of the ears, and skin texture.</p>
<p>It is much easier for children to notice these differences, not only due to them being closer in size to the average Fairie (who stands at 19cm), but also due to the child's mind being more open to differences and more attuned to seeing the world as it is. Adults life experience inevitably places certain blinders on their perceptions as they have seen most of what life has to offer many times before. Children lack this experience, and consequently have a very easy time spotting the leaf-like patterns in a Forest Fairie's skin. Adults, meanwhile, only know this Fairie is a Forrest Fairie because this diminutive elf has the wings of a butterfly, not a dragonfly.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">
    <h5 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Forest Fairies</em></strong></h5>
    <p>Forest Fairies are the most common variety of Fairie in Eyom due to the great abundance of forests found on the continent. Their most notable trait is their wings, which are fashioned after those of a butterfly (said wings can mimic any butterfly species known, or unknown). They have smooth somewhat translucent skin which is textured in a fashion which matches the leaves of a tree near to where they were manifested. Their skin color matches either the bark of the same tree, or the heartwood. Their ears are notably short and almost rounded but still retain a slight point. They tend to be the slowest fliers of all Fairiekind, but are amongst the most cunning and tenacious.</p>

    <h5 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Water Fairies</em></strong></h5>
    <p>Water Fairies are the second most common variety of Fairie in Eyom as they spawn in or near rivers, ponds, lakes, the sea, and other bodies of water (The incarnation of a Water Fairie within a beer vat in Wareneese brewery was once used as legal proof that the brewery's product could not be classified as beer). Their most notable trait is their wings, which resemble those of a dragonfly, but shimmer and shine like stained glass, and can even be color tinted with a wide array of patterns (and in rare cases, contain an actual image). They have glossy skin which seems to ripple or flow when they move as it shifts in the light and comes in many colors, including blues, greens, browns, and silver. Their ears are notably long and have a few small points, resembling a graceful fin. They are the swiftest fliers of all Fairiekind, and are amongst the most easy going.</p>

    <h5 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Stone Fairies</em></strong></h5>
    <p>Stone Fairies are an uncommon variety of Fairie which spawn from stone. Their most notable traits are their wings, and their physique. Their wings are much like a beatle's in that they can fold under the Fairie's back, which has a shell that forms to the contours of their body and is indiscernible to the naked eye. Stone Fairies are naturally muscular, possessing well toned god-like builds from the moment they manifest. Their builds are distinct enough for even the oldest and most jaded of adults to notice. Their skin is slightly rough in texture and likes to tighten when they exert themselves. It comes in all humanoid colors, though tends to have a gray tint to it. Stone Fairies often wear body oil as their skin can chap in certain humidities. They are average fliers amongst Fairie kind, but are objectively the strongest.</p>

    <h5 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Sky Fairies</em></strong></h5>
    <p>Sky Fairies are a rare variety of Fairie in Eyom which spawn in the clouds before diving to earth. They are often mistaken for Water Fairies, as their wings appear dragonfly-like while in motion and Sky Fairies are loath to touch the ground. In truth, their wings appear as individual avian feathers. Each wing will appear to have come from the same bird, and close inspection shows the wings to be insectoid in function and form, they are simply covered in fibrous strands which grant the appearance of an avian feather. They have human-like skin which tends to be a olive tone with a light tint that matches their wing colors but is only visible in direct sunlight. Their ears are notably long and hug the sides of their heads in an aerodynamic fashion. They are the the most ajile and highest flying of all Fairiekind, and are said to have "zero chill".</p>

    <h5 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Moon Fairies</em></strong></h5>
    <p>Moon Fairies are an extremely rare variety of Fairie in Eyom which spawn in hollows where Grey Elves have been found, should the hollow be exposed to the light of a full moon on an equinox or solstice. Their most notable features are their eyes, which lack any features or color, existing as slanted pools of black which shine like gemstones in the light. Their wings are more translucent than optical glass, such that they are nearly invisible when not in motion. Their wings can glow brightly in colors corresponding to their emotions, but this is quite rare as their usual levels of emotional excitement seem to "short out" their bioluminescence.  When flying, their wings beat so rapidly and regularly that they distort light and make the fairy appear to be riding a small saucer-shaped chrome object. In spite of the speed of their wings, they make little noise, only a faint, yet high pitched and unearthly, warbling hum. Their skin is always an ashen gray but has small patterns within it that cannot be distinguished with the naked eye. The markings are almost certainly depictions of arcane geometry projected onto the Fairie's skin, but not one of them has been able to hold still long enough to be mapped. These markings appear to be tattoos, but could be natural markings. They are average fliers, excepting they appear to be able to hover indefinitely (and even unconsciously as they often sleep-fly their way to snacks, or float over their beds for the duration of their rest). They are the most bubbly, happy, and personable of all Fairies, with all known Moon Fairies existing as people.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Relations</em></strong></h4>
<p>Fairies are too rare to have formal relations with any of Eyom's other peoples. They are primarily known as, and thus thought of as, the servants of a divine. They are thus treated as such.</p>
<p>Fairies dislike urban centers and thus do not live within them if they can help it. Consequently, only Rural communities have a chance to know that some fairies can be people, and generally only believe the singular fair living in or near their community has such independence due to fairies dislike of living in groups with their own kind.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Settlements</em></strong></h4>
<p>As Fairies dislike living in groups of their own kind, it is believed there are no Fairie settlements. Fairies do prefer to live in houses. If civilization is unavailable they will make their home in the hollow of a tree, or other similar dugout location, which they will furnish and decorate in a very human fashion. If civilization is available, they often take over a bird house until the owner makes them something nicer out of pitty or gratitude.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Alignment</em></strong></h4>
<p>Fairies are very easy to define in terms of the ethics and morals they follow. There are no trends amongst Fairies. No nuance. No deviations. Nor exceptions.</p>
<p>Fairies are agents of chaos. Well meaning, if misattributed, raw, undiluted, chaos.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle"><strong><em>Adventurers</em></strong></h4>
<p>Fairies tend to become adventurers more often than not. Their tiny size makes it challenging for them to find agroup willing to accept their help, as most people assume a Fairie cannot do much in terms of battling the forces of darkness. These people are fools. The leading air ace of the 5th Great Gnoll War was the Sky Fairie Sohni Acorn Mossfeather, who still holds the title of Grand Ace with her as of yet unbeaten 75 confirmed enemy aircraft killed and a further 88 downed. 16 of her kills were enemy aces, 4 of which she shot down in a single engagement.</p>
<p>Sohni did not make use of aircraft.</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Ability Score Racial Traits: </strong><span id="AbilityScoreRacialTraits">Moon fairies gain -2 Str and +4 Cha. They also gain a +2 racial bonus to one ability score of their choice at creation to represent their varied nature.<br /></span><span id="AbilityScoreRacialTraits"></span><strong>Type:</strong> <span id="CreatureType">Sky fairies are Aberrations with the Augmented subtype.<br /></span><strong>Size:</strong> <span id="RaceSize">Fairies are Diminutive creatures and thus gain a +4 size bonus to their AC, a +4 size bonus on attack rolls, a -4 penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +12 size bonus on Stealth checks. Diminutive characters take up a space of 1 foot by 1 foot, so up to eight of these characters can fit into a single square. Diminutive races typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can't reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent's square to attack it in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. Other creatures can move through those squares without provoking attacks of opportunity. Diminutive creatures typically cannot flank an enemy. But Fairies can.<br /></span><strong>Speed:</strong> <span id="RaceSpeed">Moon fairies have a base speed of 20 feet. They also have a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability, and can fly/survive in vacumes, provided the gravitational forces do not fall below 9 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</span><br /><span id="RaceSpeed"></span><strong>Languages:</strong> <span id="Languages">Moon Fairies speak common.<br /><strong>Luminous</strong></span><strong> Form:</strong> Fairies have the ability to transform into a mote of light that flits through the air, carried by their wings. While in this state, they cannot make use of any equipment or other abilities (asside from flight), but gain 50% concealment and are immune to all spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except <em><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-missile">magic missile</a> </em>and <em><a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/maze">maze</a></em>. They also gain the spells <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darting-duplicate">Darting Duplicate</a>, <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hypnotism">Hypnotism</a>, and <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep">Sleep</a> as spell-like abilities useful 3 times each. These uses are recharged by eating a hearty meal. Changing between forms is a swift action, but a Fairie cannot change their form within 2d6-CHA rounds of having changed their form previously. Any equipment a Fairie is wearing or holding changes with them, unless it is a living organism.<br /><strong>The Touch:</strong> Moon Fairies have the ability to manipulate their magical potential and energies to manifest offensive and defensive powers. This takes the form of beams and bolts of light in a color unique to each Moon Fairie, and grants the following abilities:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>Lunar Blade:</em> A short, arm-length beam of light that manifests from the hand much like a sword. Attacks made with this weapon are treated like a shortsword, except the damage is equal to 1d4 + 1/4 Character level (minimum 1) * CHA.<br /><br /><em>Moon Beam:</em> A small bolt of light similar to a magic missile, except it travels in a straight line. It is treated as light crossbow, except the damage is 1d6 +&nbsp; 1/2 Character level (minimum 1) + CHA.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>The Power:</strong> As a full round action, a Moon Fairy can intincify and focus their natural magical aura, transforming their body into a prismatic starfilled void engulphed by shimmering silver flames, thereby greatly enhancing their physical abilities. While active, this aura grants a deflection modifier to AC equal to CHA + 1/4th Character Level (minimum 1), a +5 foot bonus to speed for every 5 character levels, and allows the Moon Fairy to use Charisma in place of strength on any d20 roll. Using this ability requires a concentration check each time the Moon Fairy takes damage to maintain (DC 15). Lastly, as they are engulfed in silver <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/faerie-fire/">Fairie Fire</a>, they act as if they are affected by the spell of the same name. This ability can be used once per meal, and can be maintained for 3d6+CON rounds.<br /><strong>See in Darkness:</strong> Sky fairies can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by spells such as deeper darkness.<br /><strong>Elemental Vulnerability:</strong> Moon fairie have vulnerability to acid and electricity. <br /><strong>Loadstone Vulnerability:</strong> Moon Fairies can be easily trapped by sticking them to a loadstone, which they cannot escape without making a DC 25 STR check.</p>

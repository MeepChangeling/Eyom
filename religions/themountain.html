<p>The Spirit of the Mountain is an ancient religion which dominates the various rural villages and other communities located on Eyom's mountains. It serves the <a href="mountaingods.html">Mountain Gods</a>, a collection of deities with similar powers and abilities that are bound to individual mountains. The religion does not count itself as worshiping a pantheon, and is fairly monotheistic. The inhabitants of a Mountain God's territory will worship and venerate them, while simultaneously trash talking other mountain's gods in a well-meaning fashion similar to rival sport team's fans.</p>
<p>The religion is almost unorganized, with each holy man or woman being the autonomous leader of their own branch of the religion, with however many followers they can gather serving under them. The primary function of the Spirit of the Mountain is to restore ancient shrines, temples, and sacred sites existing upon the mountain on behalf of its specific Mountain God.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Values</h4>
<p>The Spirit of the Mountain sustains itself through the indoctrination of the current follower's children. This is seen as a noble act within the religion, so much so that failing to enlighten one's children is often punished by other members of the religion. This is rooted in the generational task set before followers by the Mountain Gods: The restoration of ancient temples created in their names and for their glory.</p>
<p>Mortal followers seek to complete these restorations as once they are completed, their god's power will be greatly amplified and their descendants will reap the benefits of their personal sacrifices, hard work, and dedication. A personal afterlife is not promised to those who follow the Spirit of the Mountain. Rather they are guaranteed reincarnation as an animal with special meaning to them. Once they die in that form, they will be reincarnated again as a different animal.</p>
<p>After several reincarnations, they will return to a patient form, enlightened to the workings of their god and its mountain. In this form and life they will be given great power in the form of either arcane or divine spells (depending on the Mountain God they serve). Individuals with such powers take leading positions within the clergy, or enact special missions for their divine in a role similar to that of the angels more powerful gods once had.</p>
<p>There is little else to the Spirit of the Mountain aside from this general arrangement. The most notable other aspect is the very close and personal relationship Mountain Gods have with each of their worshipers. A Mountain God's avatar will always be willing to listen to a mortal's problems and act as their followers friends, advisors, and sometimes even an uncle or aunt of sorts (depending on the specific God). There is also the Five Commandments of the Mountain Gods, a universal code which all Mountain Gods, regardless of affiliations, insist their mortals abide by. They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Thou shalt not be unfaithful.</li>
  <li>Thou shalt not be dishonest.</li>
  <li>Thou shalt not kill thy Brethren without just cause.</li>
  <li>Thou shalt love thy neighbors as thy family.</li>
  <li>Thou shalt be a good steward of my mountain.</li>
</ol>
<p>For their more sensible and level headed followers, the Mountain Gods have this revised list of commandments:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Be excellent to one another.</li>
  <li>Party on, dudes.</li>
</ol>


<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Deity</h4>
<p>The Spirit of the Mountain worships the deities of the mountain upon which a given group of followers live. Other spiritual entities which exist on the mountain are also revered and respected through small rituals and general ways of life (these vary mountain to mountain). The mountain itself is also respected as a spiritual entity in and of itself, though it holds the least importance.</p>

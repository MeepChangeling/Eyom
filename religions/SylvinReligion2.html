<p>The Court of Kami is a religion based out of Deivheim. It was created by the Old Gods when they left Zo behind, and holds the purpose of upkeeping the God Wall, a mystical energy barrier which serves as the walls of the God Irus's prison. The bulk of this work is performed by the Kami, elevated nature spirits which have recieved fractions of the power of true gods. They see mortals as little more than tools to use for their work, but are worshiped and obayed nonetheless. Obedience and revrence rarly go hand in hand, and few treat the Kami as a true religion.</p>
<p>Those who do worship the Kami see them as disspasionate, but eccential to everyone's survival. They are thus revered as the agents who keep the world safe, and their disspassionate stance on mortal kind is seen as simply a matter of fact. Of course they care less about you individualy. They care for the collective, and as they have made law, it is your role to care for the individuals, including yourself and others.</p>
<p>The Court of Kami has a second duity asside from maintianing the God Wall, and that is overseeing the development of the young god Khristos. Khristos is an accended mortal who absorbed the mantle, but not powers, of the previous god of nature. He is exceptionaly terrible at using divine power, being the god equuivilent of an infant. The Kami see his development as not only their duity, but their end goal as once fully developed, Khristos could potentialy put an end to Irus once and for all.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Values</h4>
<p>The Court's followers do not see religion as a means of self-improvment, or spiritual growth, but rather as nessisary labor. This is not a view which most people are comfortable with holding, hence most of Eyom's citizens follow another religion, though they will take the COurt seriously, treating it as a political body rather than a way of life or religion.</p>
<p>Those who follow the Court see the value in systems, both natural and manmade. The preservation, mantance, and construction of these systems are of paramount importance, more so than any individual's life. Every shrine that fails weekens the prison walls and brings Irus one step closer to unleashing his wrath on the whole of Zo.</p>
<p>These facts overshadow everything else for the mortal faithful and Kami alike. Any action can be justified and glorified if it furthers the God Wall in some way. This is the primary belief held by those who follow the court, but as the name "court" implies, there are myriad and byzantine codes of laws applicable only within specific juristrictions. From the perspective of the religion's followers, their town's kami is an arbatir of divine law, and the laws they have established are to be heeded more than even the laws of the land themselves.</p>
<p>Whatever those laws may be, they are the words of a divine, and serve to, in some way, ensure the land remains safe and secure, while weekeneing the enamy of mortal kind.</p>
<p>Agents, mortal or otherwise, who follow the court are those who have come into an understanding of these codes, how they operate, what they do, and agree with the Kami's methodology. They will do as they are told, questioning little, and effectivly acting as divine repairmen and construction workers. They see this as a noble task, and are largly fufilled in life due to this given purpose.</p>
<p>A list of general values held by mortal followers of the court:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compassion is the only thing keeping our species alive.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Of all tenents, this is seen as unbrekable. All actions taken by the faithful are in service to others, or communities.</li>
    <li>Even hostile actions against others will be made for the benifit of others in need.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Harmony of one's self with their environment is of crucial importance.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>This is more about conforming to local culture than eco-posativity.</li>
    <li>Maintaining a specific balance within the natural world is also relevent to this.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>A net nutural environmental impact is often desired.</li>
      <li>Many lcoations may be mandated to increace the strength of natural ecosystems arround them.</li>
      <li>Some locations may be instructed to devistate the local environment (Often to alter energy flow paterns).</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Irus's will must be oposed when discovered.</li>
  <li>The construction and mantance of Shrines is more sacrad than mortals can fathom.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Court followers have started wars over accidental damage to a shrine.</li>
    <li>Constructing a shrine is a form of sirtualistic purification all undergo several times in their lives.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Reducing suffering weakenes Irus.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>This is not a ban on violence, the Court requires violence be emploied in many situations.</li>
    <li>General goals appear to be to try and ensure the least suffering occures long term.</li>
    <ol>
      <li><i>Example:</i> If the distruction of every last man, woman, and child, in a town would advert a major plague that would kill thousands more, the Court would order that town's imeadiate distruction.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>

The Way of Kings is a small religion without much cultural influence which orginated in the <a href="../regions/AwníhgMoorland.html">Awníhg Moorland</a> the durring the latter half of the 3rd century. The religion was founded by the Cult of Thekel, a group of people who were enraged at the Kami's system of assigning a Kami to people and restricting the worship of the world's few remaining deities to those in physical proximity to them.</p>
<p>The Cult searched history for any trace of a God which might accept their worship, and found <a href="Thekel.html">Thekel</a>, Goddess of Kings, Luck, Warriors, and the Night.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>As Empire built themselves from stick and stone, but long after the Kami chose their peoples, in a lonely corner of the world, there dwelt a scattered people whom the Kami's Mandate incensed. Linked not by blood, nor bone, nor law, but by desire. Desire to be served rather than serve, a rejection of the prescripts of their birth.</p>
<p>These people gathered in quiet corners of the world, speaking with one another, sharing their ideas and ideals, forming a brotherhood of likeminds. In time, this brotherhood&rsquo;s eyes turned to the ruins of fallen Zom, and from the rubble of eons past unearthed the name Thekel. A name which matched their beliefs. A name untouched by the Kami's Mandate. They labored around this name, searching apocrypha and obscurity with zeal, while those outside their circle laughed at their antics, believing the brotherhood little more than jesters.</p>
<p>Then came the winter solstice of no moon and black sky. Great clouds covered the havens such that no stars shown upon the face of the world. Upon the stroke of midnight, when the hidden moon reached its zenith, thousands of the Brothers fell upon their swords as the rest of their kin prayed reverently, uttering the name until they grew horse, clasping their hands to their chests until their nails cut their flesh unto the bone.</p>
<p>Their prayer reached out to great totems constructed in years past. Totems now drenched in the blood of the willing. Totems the Kami have taken from this world, and purge any knowledge of their workings unto this very day. For the totems, blood, and prayer wove a great blasphemy.</p>
<p>Divine Necromancy.</p>
<p>From this blasphemy the name Thekel became flesh. On this night the Thekel the Reborn clawed her way from the grave. The Reborn&rsquo;s howls shook the foundations of the world such that all peoples know of that night, even if they know not what caused the tremors which toppled buildings and forced the magma from the hearts of mountains.</p>
<p>The Kami mustered their armies to attack the Reborn, for her existence was an abomination, and the Divine cannot abide a divine unbound by their Mandate. The Brotherhood had planned this moment for generations, knowing the will of the Kami would be to attack their chosen. They prayed through the night, channeling their nourishing faith to the Reborn and brought her swiftly from a most primal state to serenity.</p>
<p>The Armies of Heaven arrived before the Reborn and drew into ranks. Their power was greater than that of any single god, yet the night was black and the Reborn was within her Domains.</p>
<p>Before the battle commenced, the Reborn drew upon Fortune and spoke to the members of the Kami's armies, her words were for those of fallen Zom. "Soldiers," she cried, "if there is one among you who would kill his Emperor, here I am."</p>
<p>Great heartbreak and sorrow came upon many of the soldiers, and a quarter of the Armies of Heaven turned their spears upon their fellows. As they turned, their hearts belonged to the Reborn and they became creatures of the night. The Reborn drew upon The Dark and also upon Night and her army&rsquo;s power swelled to equal that of the Armies of Heaven.</p>
<p>The forces engaged upon the Reborn&rsquo;s grave, causing the sky to burn and the winds to die. The Generals of Heaven commanded their men from the rear, relaying the orders of their Kami who watched the battle from their Hall. The Reborn commanded her soldiers from the front, leading each charge, guarding every withdraw, and breaching every line as the point of her spear, for that is the way of Warriors and Kings.</p>
<p>The Armies of Heaven crumbled under the Reborn&rsquo;s assault, drawing the Kami to the field of battle. The Reborn&rsquo;s Domains were mighty, and as the night was black two stood their fullest, but there are none who can withstand the full might of the Kami United. Yet, the Kami paused in their attack, fearing for their individual lives. The Reborn could not kill them all, but they knew with certainty that she could kill one before succumbing. If she could kill one, Fortune would premit her a second, Warriors a third, and perhaps Kings a fourth.</p>
<p>As none would be the first to attack the Reborn, the Kami called for truce. They told the Reborn of the mandate, and offered her a place in the Divine Order. The Reborn refused their offer, for one cannot hold domain over Kings, yet be vassal to another. Knowing her life would be forfeit unless some agreement could be brokered, the Reborn spoke, informing the Kami that while the mandate was anathema to her spirit, its purpose was noble and she understood the whole of it. If they would cease their hostilities, leave her in peace, she would work within their rules in respect for the peace they had created, but would not submit to any shackles, nor agree to take any oath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Reborn concluded her speech. &ldquo;I yield to none, yet I work alongside all who honor me. If my word alone is not enough for you, then trade your lives for mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kami granted her request, and departed in peace, warning the Reborn that should she violate the rules of the Mandate they would return in force. The Reborn understood, and reminded the Kami that by their rules, all Kami must lead mortal people. They offered her the dregs of their own followers, yet she refused, for the Reborn had been chosen and thus would not choose.</p>
<p>The Reborn reached across the world to those Brothers still praying and spoke to them saying, &ldquo;My subjects, I accept this crown you have given unto me. As I have been reborn, so too shall you be. Let thy flesh take upon my image, and march to the ruins of my cathedral. There we shall erect the city anew and we shall arise as the greatest Empire this Age shall know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With those words uttered, the Brothers fell to their faces, their flesh contorted, twisted, and changed. The races they once were melted away, and they were now all as one blood, for they were the Omlar, and they heeded their chosen&rsquo;s commands, and made their way to the wood of Winera to restore that which lay in ruins.</p>
<p>And so the Omlar came to be, by the grace of Thekel the Reborn, Lord of the Night, Darkness, Kings, Warriors, and Fortune. She who was the last to stand against Iris the Tyrant at the end of fallen Zom, and she who was the first to defy the Divine Mandate.</p>
</div>

<p>The Way of Kings has been devoted to Thekel ever since, working to her will in all cornors of the world, though only in small pockets. The religion has a singular sacrad site, the Temple of Thekel, which is located in the southern reaches of the <a href="../maps/regionmap.html#20.729144,6.27594,11z">Preschil Maquis</a> in <a href="../georegions/pressingstone.html">Pressingstone</a>. The Temple serves as the gateway to Thekel's divine realm, a demiplane which she has created for the most faithful of her followers to live and work in, and also serves as the religion's afterlife.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Values</h4>
<p>The Way of Kings seeks to remove its followers from their native cultures, metaphysically speaking. Those who follow the way seek to reforge themselves anew as the master of some group of others, be that group large or small. This process requires removing the values instilled uppon them by their culture of birth, to turn weakness into strength, indecision into decision, and will into action. The end of the way brings a person to the point where they will no longer follow the wills of others unless it furthers their own ambitions, for that is the way of a King.</p>
<p>The Way of Kings emphasizes the importance of honor, justice, wisdom, and decisiveness. These qualities are those it seeks to instill in its followers as the keys to power, and traits one should turn themselves to embrace wholeheartedly and to the greatest extent.</p>
<p>The day-to-day application of The Way of Kings is simple: <em>Act with self sovereignty, with no gods nor masters other than those you have chosen to serve.</em> This does not mean one should be a fool, nor ignore the will of those in power over them. The intention is to remove limitations placed on the self by society to do as one desires without harming their reputations.</p>
<p>The Way of Kings is not a religion of deviants, it is a religion of people who seek the power to shape at least a small corner of the world to their will. Thus, it promotes daily behaviors and activities which take power form others and brings it to one's self. Gaining favors from others by preforming services for them, participating in local government, schmoozing with nobles, challenging those who have wronged you to a duel for honor, and other similar activities that spread one's name and deeds as a force to be reckoned with, yet one which can be negotiated with, is the foundation of the Way's adherents.</p>
<p>The Way of Kings is seen by most faiths as heretical, for it promotes a viewpoint which opposes the idea of being under the dominion of the Kami. Indeed, most of those on The Way are greatly opposed to being ruled over by others simply due to being born where they were. Consequently, the religion as a whole tends to be slightly xenophobic towards other religions on the institutional level, with no will will towards the religions&nbsp; members.</p>
<p>Of course, many people on the Way see the faithful of other religions as subjects to be ruled, for they do not seek to be their own sovereign.</p>

<h4 class="articlesubtitle">Deity</h4>
<p>The Way of Kings follows the example of Thekel, who exists on the Prime Material Plane as a creature of flesh and bone animated by divine quintessence. She is a true god, but she is not the same form of being as other gods, as her resurrection transformed her. She now exists as the greatest traits of both mortality and divinity.</p>
<p>Thekel's origins are lost to time, and she cares not to enlighten any on the most ancient days of her past. Her modern form comes from her resurrection at the hands of the first followers she had during the current Age. These individuals returned her to the mortal world from the abyss where dead gods lie in search of a god to protect them as they rejected the Kami's Divine Mandate.</p>
<p>Thekel's power is limited in scale as she is growing into her new form and still in the process of fully resurrecting nearly two thousand years after her return. At present she has omniscience within her demiplane, and is as powerful as the greatest of Deamon Lords on the Prime Material plane as befits the god of warriors. As the goddess of night, she is empowered during the dark hours of the day, though during such times she is only a tenth as powerful as Tol, Illia, or Irus.</p>
<p>Thekel is slightly disappointing in her followers, for they ultimately bow to her will rather than her own. Yet, as she is the Goddess of Kings it befits her to rule over a kingdom. Thus, she protects and shepherds her followers as if she were the Queen of a City-State. This is a most literal statement, as she has ensured her temples in distant places are embassies, appoints ambassadors, and maintains diplomatic relations with mortal kingdoms. She goes as far as occasionally traveling in person to other nations to meet with their rulers.</p>
<p>Despite this, few come to her temple. She is seen as unimportant by most, and an annoyance by a few. While the demiplane within her temple is lavish, lush with life, and a site to behold her temple itself lies mostly unattended in a forgotten patch of the world. A relic of a world that was.</p>
<p>The one power in Eyom Thekel does not recognize or associate with is the Kami and their proxies in <a href="../GeoRegions/Divheim.html">Divheim</a>. These she sees as bottom feeders, bandits, and fools. Her ultimant goal is to find demigods or godlings with enough will to power and ambition to displace the Kami's inept and ineffectual rule of mortal kind and create a new pantheon of Gods who all can turn to should they wish. A Pantheon which could stand up to Irus, and either control or slay the malicious deity once and for all.</p>
<p>This goal is presently most distant. Thekel, as part mortal, works on the time scale of mortals. To her a thousand years is a vast time. She recognizes its importance and true nature due to her abilities as a divine being, yet she weeps for the misery such a great length of time will cause mortal kind given the state of the world.</p>
